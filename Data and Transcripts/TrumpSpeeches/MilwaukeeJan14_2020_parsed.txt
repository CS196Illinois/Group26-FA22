well thank you very much
 and i'm thrilled to be back in wisconsin where we had a very big night a few years ago
 you remember that very big night
 remember that
 they said donald trump has won the state of wisconsin
 and since then we've produced everything we said and more and more
 before it was talk
 i said i'm going to do this
 we're going to take care of your trade
 what we've done with china now on wednesday we signed that's tomorrow
 what we've done with the us mca what we've done with japan 40 billion trade deal that a lot of it has to do with the farmers
 south korea
 oh you got to love trump you got to love trump
 and you're great green bay packers are playing san francisco this weekend
 good luck
 so do we have any green bay packer fans here tonight
 that's right
 and you have a great quarterback who's a good guy a good guy
 as we begin the year our economy is booming wages are rising poverty is plummeting
 crime is falling and america is the envy of the entire world
 and then our opponents say we're not going to win
 let's impeach president trump
 let's impeach him
 we've got the greatest economy in our history
 our military has been totally rebuilt
 let's impeach him
 but we've created 7 million jobs since the election including more than 1 million manufacturing and construction jobs
 nobody thought that was possible
 and we will soon be replacing the nafta catastrophe one of the worst trade deals in the history of the world frankly with the incredible us mca canada mexico a giant victory for wisconsin workers farmers and dairy producers a tremendous victory
 and we may get that all taken care of this week or next week
 it just needs one more vote and we'll get that out of the republican senate
 the republican senate will be great
 tomorrow we'll also be signing our phase one trade deal with china massively boosting exports of products made and produced right here in the great state of wisconsin
 so after years of devastating defense cuts we have fully rebuilt the united states military to a point that it has never been before and it's now more advanced more lethal and more powerful than ever
 and last year our great american warriors because that's what they are
 and they love it
 i got to tell you they love it right
 they love doing that
 they wouldn't trade places with me under any circumstances
 they wouldn't trade places with all of our great wisconsin politicians
 they want to be a military warrior and we don't want them for that
 we want them doing what they're doing
 but our great warriors carried out a daring nighttime raid and terminated the founder and leader of isis
 the animal known as al-baghdadi is dead and the wicked caliphate is 100 destroyed
 and i will tell you when we took over a little less than three years ago isis was all over the place
 now the caliphate is 100 destroyed
 do you remember when i wanted to leave when it was at 98
 i said let some of the other countries finish it off
 we're going home right
 they all said oh no sir please finish it
 so we finished it off to 100
 a few days ago
 we took bold and decisive action to defend american lives and deliver american justice
 at my direction the united states military launched a flawless precision strike that killed the world's number one terrorist number one terrorist
 do you know who that is
 qasem soleimani number one terrorist in the world
 soleimani was responsible for murdering and wounding thousands of americans and was actively planning new attacks but we stopped them cold
 and frankly they already started the attack as you saw in baghdad on our very large embassy in baghdad
 that was already started
 and i said to our generals get there now
 we don't want to have another benghazi
 not on my watch or on any watch
 they said sir we'll be there tomorrow
 i said nope you got to be there right now
 get them over there now
 there are thousands of soldiers
 they were soldiers
 you take a look at that crowd
 that was not protesters
 they were soldiers and they were surrounding our embassy in baghdad
 and all of a sudden they see these beautiful very expensive i will tell you brand new apache helicopters roaming over the top
 and then they see our great military
 you saw them in the plane right
 some of them were getting out of their pajamas
 they were
 i said don't worry about it
 i said we won't put that on
 but they were sitting there and they were calling a roll call in the plane
 right
 and it was a beautiful sight
 and these guys were better than tom cruise at his best
  protestors disturb the rally
 one protester a very weak voice
 if you people wouldn't go crazy every time you see something he'd go right through and nobody would even know she was there
 now she's going home to mom where she will be in big trouble
 because i guarantee you that mom voted for trump
 and in 10 years from now when i run yet again she'll be voting for trump too
 i'm only kidding
 i'm only kidding
 we drive them crazy
 we drive them crazy
 they say you know he's not leaving don't you
 he's never leaving
 they say he's going to win
 he's never going to leave
 these people it's called trump derangement syndrome
 it really is
 you know what they don't know is that if for any reason after five years we do leave which we will because i believe in that stuff
 right
 but you know what's going to happen to their industry
 they're all going to die and fold up
 going to be very boring out there very boring
 that's why i say at some point every single one of them will be endorsing donald trump
 but crazy bernie sanders and the washington democrats by the way bernie is surging
 bernie is surging
 bernie
 but the democrats are outraged that we kill this terrorist monster even though this monster was behind hundreds and hundreds of death
 that's two
 hey speaking of protesters have you seen what's happened in iran
 the protesters are on our side
 first time ever
 they're on our side
 in fact they put this big american flag on the street
 and the iranians thousands and thousands of iranians were supposed to walk on it and trample it and step and beat the hell out of it
 every one of them went around that flag
 they like trump
 they like you
 i'm just your representative but they like us
 they like us
 they haven't seen anything like that in a long time
 they went around did you see it
 they went around the flag
 they didn't want to touch it
 they love america
 they love our country
 that's called progress
 that's called progress
 but the democrats are doing everything possible to disparage what we did with the hit on this monster
 many of the young men and women you see walking around without arms without legs and without … were done by soleimani
 that's what he loved
 he loved the roadside bomb
 that's what he loved
 thousands and thousands and thousands in iraq in afghanistan roadside bombs
 he was the king of the roadside bombs
 great percentages of people don't have legs right now and arms because of this son of a bitch
 now the democrats should be outraged by soleimani's evil crimes not that decision to end his wretched life
 they're saying well he was a general
 he was this
 he was that
 you know what
 number one he wasn't supposed to be there
 he was a designated terrorist by president obama who didn't do anything about it as usual
 as usual they don't do anything
 they designate and they don't do anything about
 he should've been killed 20 years ago
 now here's the story with the democrats
 if i didn't kill him and let's say we lost three four five embassies or bases or thousands of people or hundreds of people or two people were killed they would have said trump should have taken him out
 anything we do they go the opposite
 so we kill him
 and that was precision
 some people thought it went much too fast
 went too fast
 so we kill him and they say what a horrible … if we didn't kill him they'd say what a horrible thing
 right
 and by the way they think they caught me
 they never catch us
 because mexico's paying for the wall
 you know that
 you'll see that
 it's all worked out
 mexico's paying
 it's driving them crazy
 now they say okay he's building the wall
 but mexico didn't pay
 mexico will pay
 and here's the thing
 you'll see that it'll come out
 we'll do it sometime during the debate or maybe before
 our debate the real debate that people are going to watch because nobody's watching
 haven't been doing great on the debates
 i have to tell you
 but we are building this wall
 we're over 100 miles right now
 we're going to be expanding the length
 you have a lot of natural where you have 1978 miles
 you need 500 miles but 700 would be good 750 or so would be great
 we're going to now get it up
 we have all the financing
 you think it's easy getting financing when people put … i can get anything from them
 i can get whatever i want in terms of money except for a wall
 and i made one big mistake
 i should have said to them we will not build the wall
 we don't want the wall
 they would have insisted that we build it
 we would have had all the money we wanted
 i made a mistake
 i made a big mistake
 now we're building the wall
 it's going up and it's going up rapidly and very soon we'll be building about a mile a day
 and we should be up to over 400 miles by next year the end of next year and shortly thereafter it'll be finished
 and it's already having a tremendous impact on people not being able to come into our country
 bernie and the radical left cannot protect your family and they cannot protect our country nor do they want to i think
 according to elizabeth pocahontas warren who has somewhat less indian blood in her than i do and i have none
 remember
 oh we hit her hard
 but i hit her too early but now it doesn't matter
 she's not going anywhere
 but bernie said according to her bernie said and i don't believe that he said this because i don't know him
 i don't particularly like him
 he's a nasty guy
 but i don't believe he said it
 it's not his field
 you have to know what people say
 she said right that bernie stated strongly that a woman can't win for president
 a woman can win for president
 fortunately that could happen
 who knows
 but she said that bernie said a woman can't win
 i don't believe that bernie said that
 i really don't know
 just it's not the kind of a thing he'd say
 if you want to keep america safe just vote republican
 we're doing so well
 we're doing so well
 now this was … leave him alone
 that's all right
 let security just take care of her
 okay you all right
 get him out here
 good
 good job security
 good job
 do we love law enforcement
 and is there ever ever a better place to be than a trump rally on some night during some week
 the truth is we have a great time
 but you know what
 more importantly we get things done
 we're getting everything done
 but even president obama's own former national security advisor a highly respected general named jim jones praised our action to take out soleimani and said it was absolutely correct and it was the absolute right thing to do
 i'm sure they like him very much
 he sounds like our kind of a guy
 so jim if they've given you a hard time come on over to the republican party
 no he's a respected guy
 he said we did the right thing
 everyone knows
 they're saying was the attack eminent
 was it eminent
 does the fact that he's killed hundreds of thousands of people and thousands of americans and horribly killed and wounded thousands and thousands
 that doesn't matter
 was the attack eminent
 i think they're going to start a new investigation
 was the attack or this horror … and by the way he was in a country he wasn't allowed to be in
 we don't mention that because he was designated and he wasn't allowed to be there
 and he was there with the head of hezbollah and they were talking about like hillary clinton
 they were talking about weddings and working out
 soleimani and the head of hezbollah they were talking about weddings working out
 or bill clinton in the back of the airplane with the attorney general where they may have made her an offer that you're going to go to the supreme court
 or they may have said you're going to to stay attorney general but help
 help
 they may have said that
 do you think they would have said that
 no
 nothing like that
 but do you remember
 they talked about golf and grandchildren right
 45 minutes
 i like golf
 45 minutes
 i like golf and i love my grandchildren
 i don't think i can talk to somebody about them for 45 minutes that i don't even know
 45
 i have a beautiful grandchild
 he's really beautiful
 he's so great
 okay
 what else am i going to say right
 then i took a… let's talk one or two
 how's tiger doing
 how's this one
 how's that one
 that's another five minutes right
 what am i going to do with the other 35 minutes
 maybe i'm going to talk about supreme court appointments et cetera
 got zero
 he got zero out of it
 he got zero
 i'd love to have that money back
 it's a lot of money
 but i've warned the ayatollah and the government of iran that they must not harm hurt or kill any protesters
 the whole world is watching
 it's watching
 they've killed thousands of protests
 we support the iranian people and their courageous struggle for freedom
 it's incredible what's going on over there
 it really is
 but we're watching it
 we're watching very closely
 and we were ready
 that night when the attack was made on us attack was made on us
 remember this they killed an american they killed other people just before that
 and so we did what we did right
 and they said it's our turn now
 i said you better be careful when you say it's our turn
 because we had designated targets that you wouldn't know… it would have taken him 30 years to rebuild if that was even possible
 it's true it's true
 and we saw those missiles launched and they were big and they were fast and they were accurate
 four of them went bad
 they fell way short
 but 12 of them hit
 and i said man they are quick
 they knew immediately what they were and they saw those missiles hit
 i said how bad is it
 it hit a base
 and an hour later or so we get a call back
 i said how many killed
 nobody sir
 i said how many hurt
 they said nobody sir
 and i said they just saved themselves a trillion dollars and a lot of lives
 that's true
 a trillion not a billion
 a trillion
 so they did a very smart thing and we're not looking for regime change
 they've tried that with libya
 they go hillary clinton let's get rid of libya
 let's get rid of gaddafi
 let's get rid of gaddafi
 how's that working out
 right
 let's get rid of gaddafi
 that was a hillary deal
 then you had benghazi
 and see benghazi they didn't respond
 they didn't respond
 should be
 should be to iraq
 iraq didn't knock down the world trade center just in case anybody had any question
 and this guy did kill
 he was not a sweetheart
 he was a bad guy in every way
 but he did kill terrorists right
 and it became harvard university for terrorists right
 but they did go after him but he didn't knock down out
 you know what i did with the soldiers
 they don't tell you the truth sorry because there are a bunch of corrupt people back there
 i told turkey you got to defend your own border
 we're not going to defend your border
 and we get along with turkey
 we get along but they've been there for… and by the way i call it a safe zone
 that is the most dangerous safe zone in the world
 okay
 i'm looking at the audience there's about three of you that want to be in that zone okay
 and you're very tough people
 but this is the most dangerous… i call it i call it the safe zone
 some day it may be a safe zone but i took our soldiers out because we had an army here and we had a vast number of people here and they were going to fight
 i said if they're going to fight like they have been for hundreds and hundreds of years for centuries let them fight
 but we're getting the hell out of there okay
 but the fake news doesn't tell you the right story
 but the fake news doesn't tell you the right story
 because what i did is i took our soldiers and you know what i did
 i moved them to the oil area and we now control the oil
 so they said trump stayed in syria
 trump said so people said to me why you staying in syria
 okay
 a long time ago
 you have no idea the things and the decisions i've seen
 so they say trump's in syria i didn't pull out
 i did pull out
 we have the oil really secure
 we'll see what happens with it but we can help our friends the kurds because that's where they got their wealth
 and then ultimately it was with isis
 but right now it's with the united states military
 and we also got rid of remnants of isis
 while we're creating jobs and killing terrorists democrats in congress are wasting america's time with demented hoaxes and crazy witch hunts that had been going on by the way from the day i came down the escalator with our future first lady
 somebody said to me recently president president it was a friend of mine used to always call me donald
 hey donald how are you doing
 let's go have dinner
 okay okay good
 now he calls me president
 i told you this before
 calls me pres… they always call me president
 president president tell me what's happening what's going on how's it all going
 you're doing such a great job
 i said do me a favor
 call me donald
 i can't
 now when they say you know what that means right
 that means respect for the office of president
 and you know what
 we're going to keep that way
 we're going to keep it that way
 we're going to keep it there
 but that's why this november we're going back and we're going to win the house
 the republicans are going to win the house
 because i don't know if you know it
 the impeachment hoax it's a total hoax
 this is based… just think of this
 this is based on a perfect phone call
 did anybody read the transcript
 it's a perfect call
 in fact if you go back and look at lyndon johnson all of them
 lyndon johnson was sort of a tough guy
 can you imagine his phone calls
 he's probably looking down or looking up and he's probably saying these people have gone crazy
 that's the nicest call i've ever tracked
 somebody said i never knew you could be so nice on a telephone call
 but this is all based on a simple phone call that was totally appropriate where the president of ukraine said there was no pressure on us
 didn't even know what they were talking about
 the foreign minister said they want to impeach
 impeach the president of the united states over a perfect phone call
 it's the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on our country
 ever
 i don't know if you've seen
 independent voters and voters i think of all of the voters including democrats moving over we just got a 195 to nothing the republicans in the house which was a fix
 nancy pelosi says it must be nonpartisan
 and she said it has to be clear cut
 well number one never happened
 no problem
 number two look at the vote
 three democrats voted with us
 so i guess you could say it was a nonpartisan vote because they voted with us okay
 but we're going back and we're going to hold the senate
 and we're going to keep the white house but we're going to win back the house
 we're going to win back the house
 and i'm thrilled tonight
 a man who has become a great friend of mine he's a warrior
 senator ron johnson is here
 come up here
 what a good guy
 congressman bryan steil
 jim sensenbrenner
 glenn grothman
 glenn come up
 come up
 mike gallagher
 wisconsin house speaker robin voss
 wisconsin state senate president roger roth
 state senate president
 come on fellas
 wisconsin state senate majority leader scott fitzgerald
 a friend of mine a world champion
 would you believe it
 is sean here
 where's sean
 where's sean
 get up here
 i love champions
 he would climb that sucker
 he was the best in the world right here from wisconsin right
 congressman sean duffy
 we miss him
 but he signed with cnn
 they paid him a lot of money and they don't put them on
 why
 because i'm pro-trump
 you think that's fair right
 he's pro-trump
 so what they've done is paid him money to silence him because he has a very important voice
 great job
 yeah i like that kind of a job
 i think he's okay with it
 he gets his check they refuse to put him on
 he says good things about trump
 we don't want you on
 that's cnn
 that's how fake right there
 turn the camera on
 and a good friend of all of ours a kenosha native reince priebus
 reince come up
 thank you man
 thank you reince
 this is a great group of republican people but more importantly it's a great group of winners
 they have been so great so they worked so hard and i just want to thank you all for being here tonight
 thank you
 thank you ron
 a great guy
 thanks to strong republican leadership like ron like all of them that you just saw america is winning again
 america is respected again
 and america is thriving again like never before
 we're doing great
 we're the envy of the world
 and under my administration we now have the lowest average unemployment rate of any administration in the history of our country
 and in your great state wisconsin… you ever noticed with biden he's always calling the wrong state
 and in your great state of iowa iowa
 it's iowa right
 no it's wisconsin
 oh i meant wisconsin
 oh i didn't know i was in wisconsin
 that's fine
 how many times has he done that by the way
 lots of times he said
 it's great to be in the state of ohio
 no sir you're in florida
 many times
 the sad part about that… sleepy joe is right
 you know the sad part about that
 when you do that you can't really recover
 you can be winston churchill make the finest remainder of remarks but you get killed
 and he does it every time
 and the fake news they give him a total pass and that's okay
 it's all right
 it's going to happen to all of us someday
 does anybody get that
 yeah
 in wisconsin the unemployment rate has reached its lowest level in history
 how's that for a sound bite
 how do you beat that sound bite right
 so now the people of wisconsin are going to say well let's see the state set a record most successful it's ever been
 and by the way that's because we got a lot of help from a guy named scott walker
 your governor
 ron johnson all those guys
 because this didn't happen so quickly
 but think
 so how do you beat that
 you have the most successful lowest unemployment rate you've ever had
 and then they say somebody's going to come and say well we'll do a better job
 really you're going to do a better job
 the lowest in history by far your number one economic numbers by far
 oh let's put somebody else in as president
 i don't think so
 right
 but here's one that i loved the most
 african american hispanic american asian american unemployment rates have reached the lowest levels ever recorded in the history of our country
 and here's another one
 african american youth the way it was was so high was so horrible
 youth unemployment has reached an all time low in recorded history
 african-american poverty has reached the lowest rate ever recorded also
 the only question are you at 70 80 90 97
 he goes higher
 what are you at
 what's yours
 100
 not bad
 i know who he's voting for
 but think of this because this is what it's about
 is that these companies these big public companies they're owned by the people they're owned by everybody
 rich people and they're owned by everybody
 we have set 141 records on the stock market highest levels ever in recorded history
 141 records
 that means in less than three years for 141 days we set a record
 think of it we've said 141 records
 who the hell can do that
 and if our opponents had won the election instead of going up we're very close to 30000 on the dow
 nobody thought that was possible
 and clearly the fakers back there nobody thought that was possible
 instead of being up you would have… i believe i really believe because regulation so important tax cuts so important to get it all going
 i believe instead of being up massively whatever the number is but depending on who you are changes but it's all way over 60 70 80 you guys know
 you would have been down 50 60 70
 you would have been down at a level you would probably be extremely depressed right now
 you wouldn't have bought all those brand new keep america great hats
 don't worry we're never getting rid of maga don't worry
 we don't have the courage to get rid of maga
 the greatest campaign in history
 we're never leaving
 but you wouldn't have bought those hats
 you know why
 you wouldn't have the money to buy him
 okay
 now you can buy them it doesn't mean a damn thing
 so let's do it real fast
 the poll right
 make america great again or keep america great right
 i don't have to go through the whole deal
 we're going to do it quick
 we're going to do it quickly
 ready
 who likes make america great again
 whoa
 they're very loyal people in wisconsin
 who likes keep america great
 all right
 so it surprises me every single time
 but make america great again maga has never won one of these polls
 you know why
 we've rebuilt our military we've cut taxes we've cut regulation our stock market hit records
 it's called keep america great
 i mean we've done so much
 and i just got a free… see these democrats they go out and spend 1 million on a poll
 what i do is i take my own poll
 and they'll interview 203 people
 203 people say they'll get it wrong
 because i'm always surprised
 make america great again i think is the greatest phrase ever used in politics right
 but under the trump economy the lowest paid earners are reaping the biggest fastest and largest games
 you know that right
 this is a blue collar boom
 they don't like telling you that
 under my administration the growth in net worth for the bottom half of wage earners has increased 15 times more than under the three previous administrations
 that's pretty amazing
 because they keep saying oh the rich are getting richer
 well the poor are doing the best they've ever done
 earnings for the bottom 10 are rising faster than earnings for the top 10 proportionately
 under eight years of the barack hussein obama administration
 which administration loves spying on people's campaigns
 by the way by the way could you imagine if it were the other way around and i spied on his campaign
 what would these fake news people be doing
 more than 300000 people under obama 300000 people left the workforce
 under just three years of by administration 3
5 million people have joined the workforce and nobody believed that was possible
 370 companies have signed our pledge to america's workers providing more than 14 million americans with new training and job opportunities
 we're training them
 we're getting them walmart so many great companies they're training people because they can train a much better than government
 14 million you know who has worked so hard on that
 everybody you've heard of ivanka right
 ivanka
 she had such a passion for it
 she's very smart
 i said would you like this
 you have no debt
 i want to get people working
 i want to get them and help families
 so i said all right good
 look she's smart
 go do whatever the hell you want to do it's okay darling
 so she had a goal of a half a million people
 she was going to get trained get into companies
 so she'd call walmart she'd call exxon she'd call all these great companies
 and all of a sudden she hit 8 million
 then she hit 9 million
 don't forget she wanted to do 500000 but this is her
 then she had 10 million
 she just hit 14 million people have been trained by these great companies
 14 million
 ivanka
 14 million would you believe that's possible
 but that's why we have the best unemployment rates we have the best employment rates
 by the way very close to 160 million people are now working in the united states
 nobody's ever even come close to that number
 we've lifted 10 million people off federal welfare programs
 real median income is now at the highest level ever recorded in the history of our country
 think of that
 real median income
 under eight years so we're here three years right but really less because when it was done the stats it was two and a half
 but we have less than three
 under eight years of the bush administration household incomes grew 400
 eight years 400
 under eight years of president obama household incomes grew 975000
 that's okay 975
 eight years right
 under three years of the trump administration household incomes have risen 10000
 ten thousand
 that's why we're doing well
 the consumer
 3100 of which for regulatory cuts 2000 for the tax cuts it's actually higher than that 2500 for energy savings and 5000 in real wage gains
 10000
 the child tax credit alone which every democrat in congress opposed is delivering 2200 a year to the average american family
 who's in favor of that cut
 who's in favor of having that
 you
 people don't know
 they think the democrats gave it
 the democrats give nothing
 they're too busy
 they're too busy doing other things
 they don't do anything
 they're too busy doing other things
 we ended the war on american energy
 the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on earth
 number one in the world by far
 saudi arabia russia but we're number one by far
 and if i get a couple of additional pipelines approved which i will very quickly instead of waiting 20 years to get them approved it'll increase this by another 22 that will get them done quickly
 and they'll be environmentally friendly and all of that
 i believe in that
 we have eliminated a record number of job-destroying regulations
 i brought back the old light bulb
 better light for much less money if you want it right
 little things
 somebody said oh sir don't mention the light bulb
 it's hard to make an elegant speech
 i'm saying i brought back the light bulb
 so the new light bulb costs you five times as much and it makes you look orange
 and i was more interested in the orange than i was in the cost
 but you know what if you want you have it
 and the new bulb i don't know if you see it it's on there
 it's a hazardous waste
 when that bulb ends you're supposed to take it to a certain dump and gingerly put it in because it's loaded up with gasses
 that's the new… i said to somebody today in environmental protection how many people do that in the country
 sir maybe none
 they throw it into the garbage can
 and it's… wait
 and it was just announced from south korea makes a lot of our products unfortunately i put a tariff on washing machines and refrigerators right
 they just announced that they're building major refrigerator and washing machine plants in the united states
 you know why
 you know why
 because they don't want to pay the 25 tariff
 so they're building them here
 that way they don't have to pay the tariff
 and just one final thing
 i know this doesn't matter but i said leave it
 it's so inelegant to- i know this doesn't matter but i said leave it
 it's so inelegant to talk about it right
 right
 isn't it inelegant
 i'm talking about dishwashers
 wait till you hear the next one
 i'm talking about refrigerators
 probably wanting to say to the union i'll leave it out because i want to get praise for making a … you cannot make a brilliant speech where they say that was such an incredible elegant speech if i'm talking about dishwashers sinks toilets light bulbs
 but sinks toilets and showers you don't get any water
 they put restrictors on and now they made them permanent
 people used to take them out
 they put restrictors on
 try going and buying a new faucet
 you turn it on no water comes out right
 we won't talk about toilets but you know that's … 10 15 but we don't talk about that
 because i've said this three or four times the only subject they ever talk about is toilets so i don't mention … but how about the shower
 you go into a shower and i have this beautiful head of hair i need a lot of water
 i need water
 you go into the shower right
 you turn on the water drip drip drip
 i called the guy something wrong with this
 no sir
 it's just the restrictor
 so you're in there five times longer than you're supposed to be
 you use probably more water and it's a very unpleasant experience right
 so we're getting rid of the restrictors
 you're going to have full shower flow
 full sink
 did you ever go to the faucet
 you turn on the faucet to wash your hands and it turns on so easy
 it's like this because there's zero pressure behind it
 no water
 you go like that the thing flips on
 whoa
 and then dung dung
 these people are crazy
 and then in california this governor who has no clue by the way he has no clue
 governor gavin newsom
 he sends all the water out to the pacific and then he just comes up … i don't know if you saw this
 they come up with rules and regulations
 starting soon if you're a person lives in california you only get 50 gallons of water
 now it sounds like a lot of water but it's not
 if you take a shower wash your hands a couple of times a day … it's not
 then it goes down to 47 46 45
 can you imagine
 you pay the highest taxes outside of new york where they're not doing a good job in new york
 they're not doing good
 everyone's leaving new york for other environs like florida
 it's not good
 because the taxes are too high
 governor cuomo's got to get those taxes down got to get them down and other things have to happen
 but here's gavin newsom
 so gavin newsom you have the water pouring down from up north millions and millions of gallons
 you know what they do with it
 they divert it into the pacific ocean because they have … we must be in wisconsin
 no
 millions of gallons coming down from the north
 they have this massive valve
 you're talking about a valve this is a serious valve and they turn it and it … because they have a tiny tiny little fish that's doing very poorly with or without the water
 so in the meantime if you own a home on beverly hills they scream at you if you want to water your grass a little bit right
 but you have no water coming in
 they divert millions and millions of gallons
 and what we've just done for the people of california is we've made it possible on a federal basis that they don't have to divert all that water anymore
 now that's only good for california but these are the things we do
 and now the last one is we're working on cars
 we're making them less expensive and safer
 we're giving them a tiny little bit more fuel and you're going to save on average 3500
 you're going to have a heavier car a little bit meaning you'll have steel instead of paper mache walls
 and we're getting a lot of good response
 and environmentally it's better because now people … the number is 12
 from 12 years ago with the old gas guzzlers they'll all be trading in their cars to get the new cars which they don't do right now
 so it's really going to be something and we're in a little fight with california over that
 but i think ultimately we win that one
 you'll buy a better car a safer car for less money
 not a bad combination
 not a bad thing
 to lift up forgotten communities that need investment the most we've created opportunity zones
 jobs and investment are now pouring into 120 newly designated opportunity zones right here in wisconsin
 and ron johnson helped and tim scott of south carolina helped right
 they're doing great
 they are doing good
 and for decades politicians ran for office promising to defend wisconsin workers but then they went to washington and lined their pockets with special interest cash as they shipped your jobs and your dreams to countries thousands of miles away
 countries that you've never even heard of
 globalist politicians lowered our economic defenses and allowed other nations to rob your factories steal your farms
 by the way no estate tax on those beautiful farms
 we got rid of that
 so now if you love your children and you have a farm or a small business or small ranch or even a large ranch you have no estate tax
 you can give it to the kids
 if you don't love your children … anybody in here does not love their children
 there are some
 come on raise your hand
 there are some
 you know they're brats
 they're little brats
 they're horrible human beings
 so if you're one of them this doesn't help you because you'll save some tax
 the fact is no estate tax on these small businesses and farms
 that's a tremendous thing because you are dying you are leaving the business to your kids
 they all said thank you very much daddy and mommy and then they went out and mortgaged the hell out of the place and they ended up losing it to the banks
 but we got rid of the estate tax on small farms and businesses and really great things
 little stuff like that we've done that we never said we were going to do but these people were ransacking your communities
 but we are defenseless no more because at long last you have a president who puts america first
 been a long time
 been a long time
 been a long time
 we're putting america first
 no issue of washington democrats more thoroughly betrayed the american people than that of immigration
 he goes traitor
 are you having a good time sir
 i think you are
 goes traitor
 i guess in a certain way they are traitors when you think about it
 left wing politicians i call them the do nothing democrats support deadly sanctuary cities demonstrating their contempt scorn and disdain for everyday americans
 these jurisdictions release dangerous violent criminal aliens out of their jails and directly onto your streets where they are free to rob attack and murder american citizens
 you have it right here
 you have it right here
 last year ice … i love ice
 i think they're so great
 you know they moved thousands of ms-13 out of our country thousands and others too
 but ice officers in this region of our country arrested nearly 7000 illegal aliens with criminal records
 so you have 7000 illegal aliens having criminal records including those charged or convicted of murder burglary robbery drug crimes killings in the most violent way
 right here in wisconsin cities run by far left politicians are releasing dangerous criminal aliens who abuse assault and threaten innocent children
 your children
 last year a place i like the sanctuary county of milwaukee released an illegal alien criminal with multiple charges for sexual assault of child
 think of that of children
 he's now at large
 they're searching all over and he's looking for yet another victim
 they're searching all over
 allowed to go from your sanctuary city
 in the city of madison police arrested an illegal alien for sexual assault
 after authorities released him he committed violent battery only to be released one more time
 they're looking for him again
 isn't that nice
 the same illegal alien was then arrested for a third time in september and charged with multiple sexual assaults including sexual assault of a child
 now that criminal is once again in wisconsin jail and i call on your left wing officials to stop the madness and to work with ice to ensure he is deported the hell back home
 get him out of our country
 democrats stand for crime corruption and chaos
 republicans stand for law order and justice
 it's true
 it's true
 we believe wisconsin should be a sanctuary for law-abiding americans not for criminal aliens
 we are removing these illegal criminals and gang members by the tens of thousands and we will not let them back
 we made a deal with guatemala honduras el salvador mexico where they accept them back
 under the obama administration they get them they bring them back
 and honduras and guatemala which they get that we're not taking them back but with us they take them back
 they take them back
 very great
 it helped a lot when we were paying them hundreds of millions of dollars a year
 think of it
 i just said we're not paying them anymore
 all of a sudden they said we would love to have our wonderful gang members back
 we would love to have our gang members back sir
 thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border we have reduced illegal border crossings seven straight months in a row and we're being helped by our new 100 miles plus of wall
 illegal crossings are down 78 since may and we have ended catch and release
 that was a tough one
 our very big and very powerful border wall is going up at a record speed and we're fully financed now
 isn't that nice
 that wasn't easy
 that was not easy
 we're adding new miles every week and we are on track to soon build that wall
 you're going to have a wall like no other
 it's going to be a powerful terrific wall
 and walls do work
 i hate to say remember the democrats you don't need walls
 oh really
 we need drones
 they wanted us to put drones flying around taking pictures of everybody
 now did you see on part of the new wall two days ago illegal aliens with drugs on their back were climbing the wall
 they got to the top
 you know that paddle on top is called a climb resistor
 it's very slippery and very hot very hot and they got stuck on the wall
 they couldn't get off the wall
 did you see that
 i was watching the news
 i was surprised that the fake news showed it and i said isn't that a beautiful sight
 they couldn't get over the wall
 couldn't get off
 they had to get the fire department to get them down
 do you believe that
 30 feet up that's like almost a four story building
 washington democrats have never been more extreme than they are now
 they're going crazy
 they're going totally loony
 nervous nancy how about nervous … how about her district
 her district is so filthy dirty
 it's filthy dirty with all of the things i won't say it but the needles and everything else
 these are areas that were 10 years ago the best in the country and now they're disgusting
 she ought to spend more time back in san francisco taking care of her community instead of wasting everybody's time
 but taking their cues from socialist bernie sanders aoc all these people liberal lawmakers are pushing a government takeover of healthcare that would strip 180 million americans of their private health insurance
 many of you have great insurance
 republicans will never let that happen
 they'll probably change their mind before the … see this is why i don't like talking about it now
 i'd rather wait six seven eight months let them say it 5 000 times when they have to do it and then talk extreme late term abortion because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from god won five times
 i said i've done one but i've won
 but it's the beep
 but no seriously we're all smart people
 how is it good when they say we're going to raise your taxes
 is the world going crazy
 they say we're going to raise your taxes
 we're going to open borders
 everybody can come in … for everybody's health insurance
 schooling
 you know one time … we're going to get everybody a rolls royce and cnn or one of them said they never said and they never promised a rolls royce
 donald trump lied tonight
 i said every illegal alien will have a rolls royce
 they said he lied tonight
 these people are sick
 but they're the party of late term abortion socialism and corruption
 the republican party is the party of the american worker the american family the american dream and of course honest abe lincoln right
 republicans are fighting for citizens from every background and from every race religion color and creed
 we are a movement
 there's a movement like nobody's ever seen before
 you know when i mention this anything i say that's even slightly false it's headlines
 trump said this
 these people
 he said this
 this is one of the greatest … i would say this
 this is the greatest movement in the history of our country
 i really believe that
 never been a movement like this
 i mean there have been some great movements where somebody came along and out of nowhere won the state of new hampshire won iowa won south carolina down the way won a state some place
 but we won 32 states
 there's never been a movement like this never happened before
 but we're a movement for all americans who believe in fairness and justice equality and dignity opportunity and safety
 we are a big tent and we are a big party of big ideas for the future
 that's why african americans are joining the republican party like nobody ever thought even possible
 they love us and we love them
 and to give former prisoners a second chance at life we passed
 it was us not the democrats
 they came to me they wanted help i gave them help
 i got it done
 i called republicans that maybe wouldn't have been so inclined some of them
 some of them very much inclined
 some of them very conservative were very much inclined
 but i got the people that we needed
 obama couldn't do it
 bush couldn't do it
 nobody could do it
 i got it approved and from the day it was approved i got no thanks i got no credit
 and that's okay because you know right
 but we passed bi-partisan criminal justice reform and that's helped so many people
 i mean you know the story of alice johnson
 you know so many different stories
 it's helped so many people especially in the african-american community the hispanic community
 it's helped a lot of people
 it's a different world
 to uphold the rule of law we have confirmed 187 federal judges a record who will interpret the constitution as written
 187
 last spring wisconsin voters as you know elected a great judge to your state supreme court and this spring you have a chance to reelect another terrific judge justice daniel kelly
 go vote for justice daniel kelly to defend the rule of law in wisconsin
 daniel kelly
 we are aggressively combating the opioid epidemic and we've done great … look until you get rid of it you never did great but we have done numbers that nobody thought possible
 in 2018 drug overdose deaths the overdose deaths fell for the first time in decades including by 10 in the state of wisconsin 17 18 19 and even 21 in a couple of states
 china is now putting a big stop a big lid on fentanyl which is a disaster coming out of china
 said to president you've got to do it
 people are dying got to do it
 they're doing it
 we are fighting very hard for school choice and it's moving along well in wisconsin
 milwaukee created the first school choice program 30 years ago to free children for failing government schools and now my administration is working to give school choice to every child in america who needs it
 as we continue rebuilding our military workers are building brand new humvee replacements … you know about that … in oshkosh and magnificent new little old combat ships in marinette
 a lot of ships a lot of humvees
 i recognized israel's true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem
 we recognized israeli sovereignty over the golan heights something they've been trying to get for 52 years
 for years you watched as your politicians apologized for america
 now you have a president who is standing up for america and we are standing up for you the people of wisconsin
 at stake in our present battle is the survival of the nation
 what these people are doing they will destroy our nation
 they will destroy our nation
 and our last election was so important
 i don't know maybe the most important ever but it was so important
 i really believe that this election maybe in its own way will be just as important
 i can't say more but just as important because we need time for that tree to grow
 you plant a tree and it takes time
 we need time for that tree to grow and we have other things that we want to do
 if you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of americans have fought and died for to secure then we must devote everything we have toward victory in 2020
 have to do it
 only this way can we save the america we love and drain the washington swamp once and for all and i have found out what a swamp it is
 bad people
 i have become the expert all what a swamp
 you know when i used to say drain the swamp i had no idea it would be that bad
 but we're winning
 we're here and they're not
 we're winning
 we're winning
 bad people
 dishonest bad people
 with your help we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity
 together we will elect a republican congress to create a fair safe sane and lawful system of immigration which now we're already doing
 we're already doing a lot of it
 you've got to get loopholes
 you know you need their votes
 we have loopholes like visa lottery
 we put names in a lottery and they come in they become american citizens
 do you think these countries are giving us their finest
 oh let's give them our best citizens put them in
 these people are crazy to allow this to happen so we're stopping it all
 but ending catch and release was a very big thing and we did that with no democrat help
 they wouldn't do it
 it's called loopholes
 who wouldn't want to end loopholes
 we will enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase made in the usa
 we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the aids epidemic in america in less than 10 years
 who would've thought that
 we will defend privacy free speech religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms
 and above all we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one america
 we support protect and defend the constitution of the united states of america
 we stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement
 we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life
 we believe that faith and family not government and bureaucracy are the true american way
 we believe that children should be taught to love our country honor our history and to always respect our great american flag
 and we live by the words of our national motto in god we trust
 they'll always be there
 we'll never let up remove it
 those words will always be there
