hello everybody
 hello everybody
 wow
 hello everybody
 thank you
 thank you
 and i'll tell you we're landing and there are thousands of people along the runways and i said why aren't they here
 sir we couldn't let them in
 why not
 let's let them in
 oh these people
 and then they put in a floor
 this is for manchester because you know about flooring
 they put in a floor that's like an ice skating rink
 so we're going to tiptoe around
 how are you everybody
 we love you
 we love you
 great great people
 manchester we had some good memories in manchester
 2016 but this is going to be we are right now in the most important election in our history
 but i'm thrilled to be back in the granite state with the true hard-working american patriots
 last night it was my great honor to accept the republican nomination for president of the united states
 we're going to win
 we're going to win
 does anybody have any doubt
 does anybody… it's very interesting last night we had an incredible time and i don't know if you know it's driving the fake news crazy
 they're back
 but the poll numbers have swung
 if you go back six months before the plague flew in from china the plague the horrible plague this election was over
 this election was over
 and then i had to go back to work
 i had to go back to work
 and then i went back to work and we've done an incredible job in every aspect of running government but i also had to start campaigning a little bit again and i did
 and today it was announced that joe biden is coming out of the basement
 because the poll numbers have totally swung
 they totally swung
 and they've swung like nobody's ever seen them swing before
 and it was rapid
 it was a rapid swing
 because they all admit that we're doing a great job
 there's not too many presidents that have done a job like we've done including keeping you out of wars bringing you home from the endless wars
 but they've swung
 but here's what i don't get
 sleepy joe's coming out he said in 10 days that's a long… 10 days
 10 days
 that's like an eternity in trumpville
 10 days
 i view 10 days is like an eternity okay
 so he decided he's coming out and he's going to be out in 10 days
 that's a long time
 that's a big percentage of the remaining time
 that's all right he's much better off where he is
 i think he's i think he just… and how about those stories from friends of mine
 how about those stories
 was that just compelling and incredible television but really that was an exciting a really good quality convention
 really great
 so many people
 so many people you saw some tragic situations some really great endorsements you saw everything
 if you… how about the endorsement of herschel walker
 when you watch that that was from the heart
 that was from the heart
 dana white today
 i just saw it today because last night i was looking at this speech a little bit
 we had a wonderful turnout last night
 what i didn't like you saw this right when it was over you saw when it was over
 the thugs outside because the democratic mayor of washington dc it's another democrat that's not believing in law and order
 and you know we give washington dc a lot of money to run it but they don't do a good job of running it
 the mayor she doesn't run anything
 and these incredible people from all over the country all over the world that were there last night they walked out to a bunch of thugs
 and that wasn't remember this that wasn't friendly protesters
 they were thugs
 they were thugs
 and the dc police are good but the mayor gave bad instructions last night that should have never been allowed to happen
 when a senator like rand paul walks out and thank god we had some good police around him and they took a tremendous… they took tremendous abuse
 and rand paul was in big trouble last night he's a good guy he's a friend of mine and that shouldn't happen to anybody
 but he is a us senator walking outside and those four policemen should be brought over to the white house and we ought to give them a medal of some kind and we're going to do it
 we're going to do it
 i told that to rand
 and the mayor should be ashamed of herself for that kind of a display of incompetence because that's what's happening in portland
 and that's what's happening all over where you have democrat-run cities
 just take a look
 and we're looking at the whole situation in dc and tonight they have a lot of people gathering let's see how that works out
 they have to be able to manage their affairs they get a lot of money
 she's always looking for money could we have more money
 what are you going to waste it on
 i mean spend it on
 what are you going to waste it on mayor
 and then our people walk out and these are people from all over the world they walk including congress by the way they walk out and they get accosted they get abused they get spit on
 it's a disgrace
 and our country is going to change
 we're not going to allow that to happen
 you know we're not supposed to be… we're not supposed to be involved unless we're invited in by the people that run these are all democrat cities just so you understand including dc
 so we're not supposed to go in unless we call it an insurrection but that's a big statement
 it's a big statement
 no reason for it
 but you know what we're going to do
 we're going to have to look at it
 mark meadows is here we're going to have to look at it because we're not going to let that happen to people that go to the white house to celebrate our country
 and a weak guy named joe biden and he's weak he's weak as hell a weak guy like joe biden didn't even bring law and order up as a subject for discussion in the entire democrat national convention
 now they're all of a sudden… now they realize because they've gone down like a rock in water they've gone down in the polls and now all of a sudden they're talking all well we have to talk about crime
 number one they have no… look at what happened to new york look at what's going on in chicago all democrats all radical left democrats
 look at what's going on in the great state of wisconsin
 now i will tell you two days ago we sent in the national guard
 that was the end of that problem
 look at portland
 we want to send in the national guard we sent in homeland security just to protect our… couple of our buildings including a courthouse can you believe it
 we sent in because- … couple of our buildings including a courthouse
 can you believe it
 we send in because they can't protect it
 so we sent they did a very effective job
 we could take care of portland in 45 minutes 45 minutes
 if that governor if that mayor would call and say please send in the national guard
 just like … hey we did it in minneapolis
 remember that
 the place was going to burn down
 another few days we send in the national guard it was over within an hour
 they ought to get smart and that's what they ought to do
 so now they're talking about well we want to … why did they call it a friendly protest
 right
 remember the idiot from cnn he's standing there
 this is a friendly protest
 behind him over his shoulders the entire city is burning down
 sixty seven days from now we're going to win the great state of new hampshire
 we have to
 we're going to win four more years in the white house
 within my first term in office we've secured america's borders brought back our manufacturing jobs rebuilt the united states military
 it was a mess
 it was a depleted mess
 wiped out the isis caliphate killed our terrorists enemies kept america out of foolish stupid ridiculous foreign wars
 achieved american energy independence
 you see the price of your gasoline
 when you go fill it up oh boy that's a nice price
 it's half what it was
 we built the single greatest economy in the history of the world
 that includes china which was having a very very bad year
 then the plague came in from china
 we had to close it up
 we saved millions of lives and now we're open again and we're setting records
 we're setting records
 wait till you see the numbers just before the election
 there'll be released and this is despite the fact that the democrats are holding back michigan north carolina
 you take a look
 pennsylvania
 they want to keep them
 by the way on november 4th regardless they'll be opening them up november 4th because they think that hurts the economy and that will hurt me but our numbers are going to be great
 we're going to have a great third quarter
 we're going to have an unbelievable next year unless somebody stupid gets elected and raises your taxes
 this november each of you will vote in truly the most important election in the history of our country
 i used to say it about 2016
 this is now at a new level
 joe biden is the puppet of the radical left movement that seeks to obliterate and destroy everything that you hold here including your second amendment which will have no chance
 your vote will decide whether we save the american dream or whether we allow biden to eliminate your jobs
 by the way it's not biden
 it's not biden
 it's his masters his … they tell him what to do his masters
 they want to erase your borders confiscate your guns appoint radical left judges and prosecutors tear down our history
 demolish your suburbs
 you saw what i did
 i ended the rule
 you're not going to have low income housing built in your suburbs anymore but nobody writes that because the fake news doesn't want to write that but everyone knows
 unless our friends in the suburbs have gotten a lot dumber than they used to be they know that
 they want to destroy your suburbs indoctrinate our children defund the police and try everything in the book to turn our cities so that they look more like portland oregon than what we're used to looking at
 never forget they are coming after me because i am fighting for you
 it's true
 today's democrat party is filled with hate
 just look at joe biden supporters on the streets screaming and shouting at bystanders with unhinged manic rage
 right
 you see it
 it's crazy
 it's crazy
 you ought to see last night in washington
 it was a disgrace
 it was a disgrace that these people are representing the united states of america
 it was a disgrace
 protesters
 you know what i say
 protest is your ass
 i don't talk about my ass
 they're not protestors
 those aren't … those are anarchists
 they're agitators
 they're rioters
 they're looters
 they're not … you know you say that and some of the people not all of them but some of the people back there oh how dare you
 these are friendly protesters right
 friendly … they're just looking for trouble
 has nothing to do with george floyd
 has nothing to do with anything
 they don't even know who george floyd is
 okay
 they don't know who george floyd
 they have no idea
 if you ask them who's george floyd
 they couldn't even tell you
 these are just bad people troublemakers and they shouldn't be representing our country at important events and we've got to stop it
 democrats have no complaint about the rioters and the vandals marauding through our cities or mass unruly demonstrations but they don't believe law abiding citizens can go to a church together
 you can't go to church anymore
 you know how many churches are closed in this country because of the democrats
 you can go out and you can have thousands of people marauding through the streets threatening other people beyond threatening kicking them in the face doing what they've done
 you've seen it
 they would have done that to senator rand paul last night
 he'd either be in very bad shape or dead and that would include his wife if those policemen didn't happen to be there
 they took some big beating
 the reason they didn't fight back too much they don't want to lose their pension
 they don't want to lose their job because we've become so politically correct everybody's afraid to do anything now but they did a good job
 the puppet biden who's just controlled so strongly wants you to cancel weddings funerals and school but has no problem with thousands of so-called peaceful protesters cramming into your streets mugging people hurting people robbing stores looting stores burning down storefronts
 the radical left will do anything to get power
 they smear justice brett kavanaugh and they are … did you see anything like that
 justice kavanaugh
 people forget
 time goes by they forget
 we don't forget
 i don't forget
 they're destroying the livelihoods of innocent people and if biden wins which i honestly can't believe can happen
 i will have lost to a low iq individual
 i don't want that
 i don't want it
 sleepy joe i don't want it
 but the agitators will go from rioting in the streets to running the halls of government
 can you believe it
 the levers they call it the levers of government
 the top 10 most dangerous cities in america are run by democrats and have been for decades
 now they're trying to impose those policies across the entire country
 no one will be safe in biden's america
 i can't even call it biden's america
 god doesn't know he's alive
 he's going to be out in 10 days
 he's going to start 10 days
 ten days
 i mean i gave a big speech last night
 i said what am i doing tomorrow night
 you're going to new hampshire but sir we can cancel new hampshire because you had a big night
 we can cancel
 are you crazy
 i don't have the courage to cancel new hampshire
 i got to win new hampshire
 i love the people and you've been very good to me
 you've been very good to me
 you've been very good to me
 so new hampshire was the first state i won
 right
 remember i came here
 i was very excited
 that was an exciting evening
 that was an exciting race but we don't talk about that anymore
 we have to talk about the future
 we don't talk about it
 that was great
 it was important
 we've done more than any administration in its first three and a half years in the history of our country
 that's despite phony witch hunts phony investigations a phony impeachment based on a phone call that was absolutely perfect
 that's despite a pandemic that was probably sent in by china who the hell knows how it got here and all over the world because china does not want to see me win i can tell you that
 we're not happy with china
 i'll tell you why
 if biden got in china would own the united states very quickly
 they'd own it
 if the democrat party wants to stand with anarchist criminals rioters looters and flag burners that's up to them
 the republican party and you i can see you
 is there anybody in this place that enjoys burning the american flag
 is there anybody
 please quietly raise your hand
 be careful
 could be very dangerous
 the republican party will remain the voice of the patriotic heroes who keep america safe and our law enforcement
 right
 we are all that stand between the american people and the left wing mob
 if you want to save democracy from the mob then you must vote to defeat an extremely poor candidate
 look i believe i have the honor of running against the worst candidate ever put up by the democratic party the worst
 how do you get worse
 i believe he's the worst candidate the slowest candidate
 i mean in prime time he was the slowest candidate which was a long time ago
 primetime
 you know what i don't like though they say he's like 78 79 78 i guess
 right
 i know people that are 85 that are 88 92 bernie marcus home depot he's 92 years old
 he's the sharpest guy you'll ever meet
 there's nothing … 78 is okay but that's a bad 78 not a good 78
 78 is okay but he shouldn't say that
 they shouldn't say … the press they say he's too old
 he's not too old
 he's not too old but 78 is okay but i do
 i know people in their 90s that are 100 sharp and good physically actually good physically
 you want debate
 so do i
 i want debates too
 i want debates too

 with the help of everyone here today we've accomplished more in the first three years
 we've done so much
 we've done so much
 you can go over at taxes and you can go over what we've done with the military
 we passed the biggest tax cuts ever ever the history of our country
 now they want to raise taxes
 think of it
 all my life i've watched politicians
 don't forget i've only been doing this for four and a half years
 i haven't been to … i've had senators come in
 i've had congressmen come in
 sir i've been doing this for 25 years and in 25 years i've only lost three races sir
 i said but i've only been doing it for four years and i only won one race but now i have to win two
 one race i won but it was the president
 it was for president
 it was for president but we did the largest tax cut in the history of our country
 we eliminated the most job destroying regulations in the history of our country
 i ended the job killing paris climate accord
 that was a killer
 that was meant to hurt the united states
 by the way in case you had any questions
 today the united states is the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on earth
 to give critically ill patients access to lifesaving cures we passed and hopefully anybody here doesn't need it
 nobody here
 uh-oh do you need it
 uh-oh
 don't raise that … oh she is
 is she okay
 i'll get it for her
 is she okay
 we got to get her on the list
 tell me
 oh from before
 well that's a long time before i was president
 does she want to get on the list
 because i've seen you at rallies before
 i want to get … will you please i want to get his wife on the list
 it's called right to try
 right to try
 good work
 he's been a friend of mine
 come on
 he's been here for a long time
 he's been a good guy for a long time
 we got to … is your wife how she doing
 she couldn't get it before me
 well we had that with mueller
 you saw that with the mueller's last night
 you saw that right
 was that assad with their incredible daughter what happened
 he said if trump was president that wouldn't have happened and they're right that would not have happened
 we took out al-baghdadi
 i wish i were president you would had a different solution
 thank you
 thank you
 go ahead
 how about you
 yeah
 we'll talk to you later
 right to try
 you have no idea
 so many people they used to travel all over the world to get a cure
 now we can sign a quick simple document
 it sounds easy it wasn't but it was easy for me
 i understood it
 now you signed a document
 we give you the greatest medicines even if they haven't been approved
 if somebody's terminally ill like in the case of your wife if somebody's terminally ill at least you have hope but it's beyond that because people have gone home
 you have to see some of the results have been incredible
 you saw one of the people the other day right
 that wonderful young lady that was so incredible and spoke so well
 she's a special person
 she really is a special person
 thank you
 we'll talk to you
 thank you very much
 to bring opportunities to our inner cities i signed the groundbreaking criminal justice reform prison reform opportunity zones permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities
 true
 before the china virus came in before that china virus came in we had the best job numbers ever recorded the history of our country
 we had almost 160 million americans working
 we had never had numbers like that
 the republican party is the party of abraham lincoln
 remember that
 we- we stand for so much including martin luther king's dream of a nation where our children are judged not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
 you know that
 the radical left's effort to divide everyone by race tears us apart
 there's so much racial hatred and it's put there by cnn by msdnc… they stoke the flames and they know it
 the good news is the ratings aren't great
 so that's okay
 they don't have great ratings
 but they stoke the flames
 uh-oh cnn just turned off their camera again
 they always turn off their camera
 why do i keep doing that
 every time i do it they turn off their camera
 they did it last time
 i mention cnn they're screaming turn the camera off
 our movement is about a brighter future for all americans of every race religion color and creed
 joe biden spent the last 47 years betraying the african american community
 i've spent the last four years delivering for the african american community like nobody with the exception possibly of abraham lincoln has delivered before
 it's true
 my first week in office i withdrew the united states from the last administration's horrible stupid insane trans pacific partnership
 would've destroyed the us auto industry and many other industries
 new hampshire lost one in four and i think much more than that manufacturing jobs following twin disasters of nafta and china's entrance into the wto
 it was more than one in four
 that statistic is wrong
 please have it changed
 the statistic is wrong far more than one in four
 earlier this year i kept my promise and replaced the nafta nightmare with a brand new us-mexico-canada agreement
 they said that couldn't be done
 i also took the toughest ever action to stand up to china's pillaging and plundering of american jobs
 joe biden's agenda is made in china
 my agenda is made in america
 after years of building up other nations we are finally building up our nation and our jobs and we're taking care of our people
 last night i got great reviews of the speech and all but some of the fakers back there they said well it was a little long
 he shouldn't have used the white house
 oh really
 tell me
 but they said it was a little… then one person i think it was chris wallace
 nice guy
 he's actually a nice guy
 he said that he didn't have the same energy in the speech that he usually has
 well it's a different kind of a speech
 tonight i'm in new hampshire and we can wing it
 see actually actually chris who has always wanted to be his father but it never worked out because of a lack of talent
 actually though actually chris has it wrong
 if i did last night's speech here by now you would have all been walking out
 and if i did tonight's speech there i would have been criticized by being slightly radical
 but we're having a good time doing it this way right
 because we are finally putting america first
 under my administration america's borders are more secure than ever before
 we ended the catch and release stopped asylum fraud
 and we have deported 20000 gang members and 500000 criminal aliens
 we've already built 300 miles of border wall and we're adding 10 new miles every single week
 the wall will soon be completed
 and our numbers on the border are the best they've ever been
 and by the way mexico is paying for the wall
 just in case you didn't know that
 they don't know that
 they're paying for the wall
 you haven't noticed on the wall
 everything was wall wall
 they didn't think i was going to get it done
 because look you have one major party controlling congress and they don't want to give me a wall
 so they're going crazy
 wall
 the wall's not getting done
 then i get it done
 get it from the military get it from everything
 i'm a developer
 i know how to get money
 it's one of those
 developers understand
 and now that the wall is almost complete it'll be soon complete
 and it's the wall that border security wanted so badly
 this is the one
 but now that it's built you never hear about the wall
 they don't talk about it anymore
 they don't talk about it anymore
 it's incredible
 but the wall will soon be complete
 we've invested 2
5 trillion in the us military and launched the first new branch of the us armed forces in nearly 75 years
 the space force
 and al in honor of you we have passed va choice and va accountability al
 that guy's been bugging me for years
 al has been bugging me
 what's in that hat al
 let me see
 let me… it's something
 al he's been bugging me for years
 did you ever think we'd get va choice va accountability
 did you ever really believe it
 thank you al
 i withdrew from the last administration's disastrous iran nuclear deal a disaster
 150 billion we paid iran for a basically short term deal
 and we gave them… what's more impressive we also gave them 1
8 billion in cash
 cash
 many plane loads
 you know what that took
 many many plane loads 1
8 billion
 i said bad
 that's when i realized how powerful a president is in the united states
 when a president has the right which by the way i don't believe he did have that right okay
 when a president has the right to go into the banks and take out 1
8 billion and hand it to people that hate our guts that's power
 that's power
 i don't believe he had the right to do it
 i kept my promise recognized the true capital of israel and opened the us embassy in jerusalem
 i recognized israeli sovereignty over the golan heights and we achieved the first breakthrough in the middle east in 25 years
 you saw that just last week
 uae highly respected
 mohamed highly respected
 uae and israel
 and now they're all going to be coming in
 now they're all saying how come you didn't tell us about this
 you'll have peace in the middle east
 and yet we're moving our trips out
 it's pretty amazing actually
 we'll get no credit for it but that's all right
 remember that kaitlan
 cover that properly kaitlan
 we like kaitlan
 together we've spent the last four years cleaning up 47 years of biden disasters
 joe biden has spent his entire career on the wrong side of history
 he supported nafta
 china's entry
 he's done so many things
 this man if you look at what he's done we went into a deal the korea you know about the korea deal
 hillary clinton's deal along with biden
 they promised 250000 jobs right
 250000 jobs
 and they were right
 except all those jobs went to south korea
 they didn't come to us
 00 the polls close
 and they said donald trump has won the state of texas
 simultaneously with the closing
 i'm now running in texas against a man who's against oil guns and god
 how do you win texas
 i said this you could bring george washington back as your presidential candidate
 you could bring abraham lincoln
 let's put him as the vice presidential candidate
 run in texas and other states you couldn't win
 you couldn't win
 now they're not going to win
 we're going to win this
 and you're against the oil stuff too
 because his whole thing on oil no fracking no this no that
 new england has the highest energy costs in the united states
 and you know why
 because governor cuomo will not let a pipeline go across the tip of new york state so that oil and gas of which we have plenty can come
 and do you know where you buy your energy from
 russia
 did you know that
 you have ships much of it from russia because governor cuomo new york won't allow a pipeline and they're desperate to have something happen in upper new york state
 and those are great people but they've been treated very badly
 but they won't allow a pipeline
 by not allowing a pipeline we're trying to do it through essentially eminent domain
 by not allowing a pipeline to go through upper new york state and create a lot of jobs for them you have the highest energy prices in the united states by far
 thank you new york
 thank you
 thank you governor cuomo
 biden voted for the iraq war
 i was against the iraq war
 he opposed a mission to take out osama bin laden
 he opposed the killing of soleimani
 you remember that one
 he oversaw the rise of isis and he cheered the rise of china as a positive development for america and for the world
 that's not a positive development
 before they went into the wto china was flat lined
 for years and years and decades flat lined
 and then they got into the wto and a lot of bad things happened
 first china's stole our jobs plundered our intellectual property and unleashed the virus
 and now china is trying to just hug and kiss joe biden
 they want him so badly
 look if you like china you should vote for biden that i can tell you
 how about his son
 you think the son maybe there's a conflict
 how about his son
 where's hunter
 where is hunter
 where is hunter
 does anybody know
 where's hunter
 he's in another country right now probably ripping off another country
 no as soon as biden became vice president bad things happened with respect to a hunter
 if that happened with respect to my family i wouldn't be standing
 i guarantee you that
 i guarantee you that
 what a disgrace
 what a disgrace
 ukraine
 and it's not just ukraine and it's not just china
 but he goes into china takes out 1
5 billion to manage and he knows nothing and he wasn't even employed
 he got thrown out of the armed services
 so give me a break
 it's a disgrace what's happening
 there's a double… there's a thing happening with the media like nobody's ever seen before
 these people right here
 because if that happened to a republican in particular
 if any of that stuff happened to me it would be brutal
 but it happened to him
 they don't want to talk about it
 and how about the questions asked by anderson cooper yesterday
 anderson cooper
 he's interviewed me a lot over the years and i always got along with him but they were tough interviews
 did you hear the questions
 and biden kept looking down
 i think he was reading the answers off a teleprompter
 right
 i think he was reading the answers off a teleprompter
 and that's happened before
 and how about david muir of abc
 he's a nice guy right
 how soft were those questions
 how soft were those
 they don't ask me questions like that
 they got fire pouring out of their eyes
 no
 mr
 vice president what do you think of this
 how was your breakfast sir
 did you enjoy it
 when i banned travel from china biden called it hysterical and xenophobic
 he even used somewhere along the line the word racist
 he always figures they always want to get that word in there
 if we had listened to joe hundreds of thousands of more americans would have died
 but instead my decision saved thousands and thousands of lives
 and then we banned europe very early because i saw what was going on really in italy and spain and france
 when the virus arrived we launched the largest national mobilization since world war ii
 mike pence did a great job
 we produced more than 100000 ventilators within weeks
 and not a single american who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator not one
 you heard all about and now we're producing ventilators
 hard to produce
 expensive complex
 we're producing them now for the rest of the world
 188 countries were affected by this
 we pioneered advances in treatment that have reduced the monthly rate
 and you look at this the mortality rate has been reduced by 85 since april
 think of that
 85 since april
 under operation warp speed three different vaccines are right now in final stage trials
 if you go back three years that would have been something that would have been impossible to even discuss
 it would have taken years
 we will produce a vaccine this year and together we will defeat the virus
 it's already getting defeated
 and by the way another big democrat hoax
 another big hoax
 i want football back
 i'm the one that's been saying
 is that a correct statement
 i want football back
 these are young strong guys
 they're not going to be affected by the virus
 if you look at it it's generally older people
 older people that have heart conditions that have diabetes that have problems
 these are big strong guys
 they'll be just fine
 but i want football back
 i've been calling for football to be back including big 10
 big 10 get with it
 open up your season big 10
 and the dems don't want it back for political reasons
 but now their new line… this is like russia russia russia
 all this crap they come up with
 now their new line is they are trying to blame me and keep football shut down
 they want to keep it shut down
 and they're saying that president trump shut it down
 i'm the one that wants it open
 so they're reversing it
 they're playing a big con game
 it's just a con game
 and that's what we're dealing with
 and we have to defeat them on november 3rd
 i want football back and big 10 open
 and now the other day joe biden came up with a plan to impose a blanket shutdown
 he'd be willing to do another blanket
 and we had to do it
 we blanket we shut down
 we saved millions of lives
 instead of the number we have today 175000 we could have had 2 million today instead
 it would have been unacceptable unsustainable
 unsustainable
 we did everything right
 we did it right
 we closed it down
 we stopped china
 we stopped europe
 now we're opening it up and we're opening it up to record numbers despite the fact that the democrats are keeping their states shut down and hurting people that live in those states shut down as long as possible
 but now biden wants to do another blanket shutdown possibly that would decimate the economy and cause suicides drug overdoses alcohol abuse heart attacks joblessness
 you'd have jobs all of the problems that it causes
 because it's not just a one sided equation
 a shut down causes big problems also
 and at this point when the economy is roaring back
 we had record job numbers this last quarter over 9 million jobs
 we're going to throw that all out
 we have a market… you know your stock market
 who has 401k's here
 your 401k's and your stocks when you have stocks would be obliterated
 and right now we have just on two of your markets as you know sp and nasdaq you're at new records
 and you're about to hit another new record
 think of it
 who would have thought the stock market
 and hopefully we're at the end of this horrible china virus
 came from china
 they should have stopped it and they did
 but who would have thought just who would have thought that the stock market is at record levels right now
 record levels
 and everything else is going to follow
 before the virus we created an economic miracle and now we're doing it again
 we did the paycheck protection program where we saved more than 200000 jobs in new hampshire alone
 200000 right
 over the past three months we've gained so many different if you look at retail numbers
 take a look at our retail numbers
 they're literally at records
 look at some of the numbers be announced by companies
 they're at records
 can you imagine giving that all up and starting again
 it's not acceptable
 if i'm reelected we will create 10 million jobs over the next 10 months and we'll do that easily
 the biden agenda with big tax increases and big regulation increases would immediately kill everything
 you will go into a depression
 and i'm very good at predicting this
 you will go into a depression the likes of which this country has not seen since 1929 and who knows maybe worse than that
 they are playing a suicide mission
 … be worse than that
 they are playing a suicide mission if they want to raise your taxes
 they want to raise your taxes by 4 trillion
 and that's going to be almost everybody
 they're saying for the rich
 no not for the rich
 they're going to be raising everybody's taxes almost
 joe biden is running on the most extreme far left platform of any nominee in american history and of our foreign adversaries we're devising a plan to destroy the united states from within
 all they have to look is at the biden harris
 how about her
 is she a beauty
 what a beauty that is
 they pick a woman who starts off… she starts off sort of strong
 she's one of the favorites
 within a period of a few months she goes down down 15 12 11 nine eight five three two
 then she goes i'm going to leave because i've decided that i want to leave
 i want to leave
 she left because she wouldn't have gotten any votes
 she was terrible
 this would be your president possibly
 i don't think so
 i don't think so
 i want to see the first woman president also but i don't want to see a woman president get into that position the way she do it and she's not competent
 she's not competent
 they're all saying we want ivanka
 i don't blame them
 they want to eliminate america's borders in the middle of a pandemic suspend all deportations restore catch and release and expand horrible dangerous disgusting sanctuary cities
 they want to give illegal aliens government healthcare and taxpayer funded lawyers
 that's what we need is more lawyers
 let's get some more lawyers into the act
 they want to end national security travel bands from jihadist nations very dangerous and increase refugee admissions by 700
 this is in the bernie sanders crazy bernie you know crazy bernie
 a lot of his people are going to vote for me just like they did last time
 you know why
 because of trade
 because i agree with bernie sanders but my trade policies are much tougher than his and i'm able to do it
 all you have to do is how is china doing last year with my trade policy
 not too well
 and we had the best year we've ever had
 we're going to get a lot of bernie sanders voters because they like my attitude on trade
 they really like it because i've been telling people for years our country is being ripped off by china and many other countries including i hate to say it our allies
 our allies have been ripping us big
 and you heard me say last night nato i got 130 billion from them first time going up to 400 billion a year from nato countries by saying you got to do it
 you got to do it
 and general secretary stoltenberg said it can't be done
 he could not believe it
 he's actually my biggest fan and nobody ever calls him for a quote
 call him sometime
 they want to abolish cash bail and cut funding for law enforcement
 they want to end… we want to increase law enforcement not cut law enforcement
 and by the way pat lynch is a great guy new york new york
 really great new york's finest right
 their rights have been taken away from them
 literally they're not allowed to do their job but pay lynch he said the first time in history that they know of new york's finest have endorsed a candidate
 the candidate is donald trump
 first time they've done it
 all over the country the sheriffs of florida all of texas all over the country ohio law enforcement's endorsing trump
 i cannot imagine them getting any law enforcement endorsements
 if they do please let me know and we'll have a little discussion
 we'll ask why did that happen
 they want to end school choice and ban charter schools
 they want to abolish american energy including all of the things i said before
 and add to that coal and add to that shale
 a vote for republicans is a vote for safe communities great jobs a bright future the american dream for all americans
 there is no limit to what we can achieve with four more years
 so in conclusion i have to say this
 over the next four years we will make america into the manufacturing super power of the world that's happening already
 we will end our reliance on china once and for all
 we'll do it here
 like we used to do in the good old days before we owed trillions of dollars
 we will hire more police increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement surge federal prosecutors into high crime communities and neighborhoods and ban sanctuary cities
 we will kill our terrorist's enemies as we've been doing while keeping america out of the endless foreign wars
 i go to dover and i greet these incredible families of soldiers that have been so sadly killed
 so sadly killed
 it's such a shame
 i go to the hospital i go to walter reed medical center
 it's incredible
 the doctors are so talented
 i see what they can do but soldiers so badly hurt
 and they're really acting as police
 they're acting as police
 now we're very low in afghanistan now in terms of numbers of troops
 we're getting out
 we'll be getting out soon
 we're very low in iraq
 we're very low in syria except we kept the oil
 we left some behind for the oil
 if you don't mind we kept the oil
 we should have kept the oil in iraq like i've been saying
 we'll appoint prosecutors judges and justices who believe in enforcing the law not their own political agenda which is what we have in many cases right now
 the next president will be in my opinion responsible for two three four and maybe maybe even five us supreme court justices
 you better vote for me you better vote for me or you're going to have the greatest depression you've ever seen
 we will uphold religious liberty free speech and the right to keep and bear arms
 second amendment
 we will surprise medical billing require it's already done
 i signed it
 nobody can believe i did it
 price transparency
 you know what that is
 do you know how big that is
 where you're able to actually negotiate with hospitals see their prices compare it
 you know who likes it
 good hospitals and good doctors
 other people don't like it
 it's the biggest thing and nobody even talks about it but i've already put it into effect
 the bad news is it goes into effect on january 1st
 you better make sure you elect me so i get credit for it
 otherwise could you imagine if sleepy joe got in and medical prices and drug prices and everything had dropped but he said i wonder what happened
 and i did it all
 i'll be so angry at new hampshire
 i'll never speak to you again
 now all these things what we're doing with drugs we instituted a favored nations laws
 we instituted favored nations
 that's going to drop your prices 50 60 70
 and i'm the only president in 51 years last year drug prices went down a little not much but they went down the first time in 51 years
 favored nations could drop at 50 60 or 70
 on top of that i instituted rebates where the rebates go toward price reductions and back to the customer instead of to a middleman
 so we will protect medicare and we will protect social security and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions
 america will land the first woman on the moon and the united states will be the first nation to plant its beautiful american flag
 do we love our american flag
 or mars
 above all we will teach our children to love our country to honor our history and be inspired by the words of the new hampshire state motto
 have you ever heard of these words
 live free or die
 live free or die
 vote for those people
 and you do you have a great governor
 vote for your people vote for your governor
 you have a great governor
 from portsmouth to dixville from concord to keene
 i know a friend from keene
 great guy
 i had a friend from keene a long time
 keene new hampshire
 and merrimack to manchester we will fight for every job every family and every neighborhood
 we will fight for every vote
 we have to win
 we have no choice
 can i be honest with you
 we're working hard
 we're all working
 i don't have to do this
 i could get off that beautiful plane that used to be black and white with a red stripe
 that was mine
 but that's air force one
 i get off that beautiful plane
 i could come up and say ladies and gentlemen of new hampshire you have no choice
 you have to vote for me because if you don't you'll be put in radical lefties
 you'll have a depression
 your stocks will be worthless
 your 401ks will be gone
 there'll be crime all over your streets
 so i'm not going to work at all
 i'm leaving now but you have to vote for me because you have no choice
 right
 i could say it
 right
 right
 we stand on the shoulders of american heroes who crossed the oceans blazed the trail settled the continent tamed the wilderness laid down the railroads
 won two world wars defeated fascism and communism and made america the greatest nation in the history of the world and we are making it greater
 we will be greater than ever before
 incredible citizens like you the people of new hampshire helped build this country
 and together we are taking back our country
 we are not going to let the radical left socialists or communists take our country
 we're not going to let it
 we're returning power to you the american people
 with your help your devotion and your drive we are going to keep on working
 we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning winning winning
 we are one movement one people one family and one nation under god
 and we don't take the beautiful word god out of our pledge of allegiance do we
 they did it twice
 they it twice
 then they say well we didn't mean that
 oh i see
 i was listening once they said that's right
 you don't know what it is what happened
 what happened
 they did it on purpose
 they did it twice
 that's where they're coming from
 you can be fools and you can be fooled but that's where they're coming from
 so don't be surprised but they're not going to get there
 we're not going to let it happen
 we're not going to let our country be destroyed by a bunch of nut jobs
 america will soon be thriving like never before and together with the people of new hampshire that have meant so much to me and i brought down opioid and i brought down drug problems for you by 19 and nobody even talks about it
 19
 i talk about new hampshire a lot because you had one of the proportionally worst problems of any country of any state in this incredible country
 you had one of the worst problems of any of the states
 and i talk about you a lot
 it was incredible
 and you still have
 but we brought it down 19 and people are absolutely shocked
 if it weren't for the china plague the number would be 25 or 30
 that really hurt us because people sort of went back to some old ways because they don't want to be shut down any longer
 joe don't you understand that
 they don't want to be shut down
 so i worked very hard on that for this state and for other states but this was a state that was so severely impacted with the drug problem
 that wall is stopping them and it's stopping them like never before
 it's stopping them like never before
 i want to thank new hampshire for all you've done for me
 i want to thank new hampshire
 you were my first victory as i said but you are going to lead a nation to the most important victory and the most important election that we've ever had
 we will make america wealthy again
 we will make america strong again
 we will make america proud again
 we will make america safe again and we will make america great again
 thank you
 thank you
