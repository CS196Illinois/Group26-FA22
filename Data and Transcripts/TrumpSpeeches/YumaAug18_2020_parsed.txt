oh thank you very much everybody
 thank you
 well thank you very much
 thank you very much
 and considering that we caught president obama and sleepy joe biden spying on our campaign treason will probably be entitled to another four more years after that
 i wanted to thank you and art and brandon you're incredible
 i've known you now a long time
 right from the beginning we had the chemistry we had that good chemistry… oh sit down
 it's 122 degrees in this place
 and we have our great governor
 governor can we make it a little bit just a little
 this is like a test
 you think joe biden could do this
 i don't think so
 so i'm thrilled to be in yuma arizona to proudly accept the endorsement of the national border patrol council that's a big deal
 and they are great friends of mine
 and we're building the wall
 next week we'll be up to 300 miles of incredible wall
 and our numbers are the best
 we are very tough at the border
 when people want to come in for our farmers et cetera et cetera we're not going to hurt our farmers but we've never had better numbers than we have right now
 and that's been helped because we're at a little bit over 280 miles right now we have never been helped like this
 wall there are two things in a thousand years you can come back two things will never with technology it's obsolete before you even put it in the box but two things never get old wheels and walls
 wheels and wall
 if you come back in a thousand years you'll say well we still have wheels in walls
 and that's the only thing you'll recognize
 the national border patrol council is the official union representing the incredible heroes of the united states border patrol
 they've been my friends from the beginning
 to every border agent and i just met some unbelievable people backstage these are great people and every family member here today you have earned the everlasting gratitude of our nation
 and i want to thank you very much
 thank you very much
 as you know better than anyone the survival of our nation is at stake in this election
 and i will tell you i never thought i'd say it because we had a great election
 we had a great election a little while ago
 four years ago i never thought i'd say anything could compete with 2016
 this election that we're going into is the most important election in the history of our country because we had crooked hillary but this is something these people are sick
 and we have to make sure that this radical left socialist and beyond because this is beyond socialism that it doesn't happen or we will indeed have venezuela on steroids
 so we can't do it
 most important election november 3rd get out and vote
 joe biden is the puppet of the radical left wing movement that seeks the complete elimination of america's borders and boundaries
 they want to take the wall down they don't want to have borders they want to have sanctuary cities lots of bad things they want
 following orders from his boss
 i guess his new boss is bernie sanders
 can you believe that
 crazy bernie
 joe biden has pledged to abolish immigration enforcement suspend all removals provide free government healthcare and they want to give it to illegal aliens
 you don't get it
 restore catching and release
 shield violent criminal aliens
 this is what they want to do
 and give every illegal alien on the planet earth a free ticket to invent an asylum claim and gain automatic admission into our country
 we will have people coming into our country that never even thought of it before
 you get free education you get free healthcare why wouldn't they come
 let's go to america
 the biden plan would unleash a flood of illegal immigration like the world has never seen
 it's crazy
 biden's plan is the most radical extreme reckless dangerous and deadly immigration plan ever put forward by a major party candidate
 it must be defeated and it will be defeated on november 3rd
 it will be defeated
 at last night's democrat convention which by the way got very bad ratings i have to tell you
 unity
 they talk about unity
 they want to bring unity
 and then you listen to michelle obama's speech which was obsolete by the time it got there
 she taped it
 no she taped the speech
 it was obsolete
 she must have taped it about three weeks before
 i'm speaking next thursday maybe i'll tape it
 but i don't think that goes
 that's so much nicer to tape it you do it nice air conditioned room
 and she not only taped it but tell me when you hear a divisive speech… they talk about me as being a divider
 i'm not a divider
 i bring people together
 we were bringing people together
 we were bringing people together like never before
 success was bringing everyone together and then we got hit with the china virus but we were bringing people together
 but one of the opening speakers last night said that america will go to hell if we don't have open borders
 think of that
 go to hell
 when a country doesn't have borders you don't have a country
 today a democrat speaker at the convention said we're talking about abolishing the police we're talking about abolishing ice we're talking about abolishing prisons
 biden's campaign has turned into a cult for open border and others zealots
 by the way they want to double and triple your taxes they want to increase regulations they want to spend very little money on our vets after we took care of our vets better than anyone's
 91 approval rate
 and they want to spend much less on our military we've totally rebuilt
 two and a half trillion dollars we've totally rebuilt our military
 bernie sanders declared in his speech many of the ideas that just a few years ago were considered radical are now mainstream
 that's bernie sanders
 because joe he doesn't know where he is
 but if he did he's been brought so far left that our country will not be the country that we know
 it will have problems it will go down
 your stocks will be gone your 401ks will disappear
 and right now who has the 401k
 and then the rest of you many of you have stocks and you do it a different way
 that will go down 50 60 70 80
 and if you held on like i said to do we went down a little while we got hit with a virus
 now nasdaq just broke an all time record
 snp just broke an all time record
 socialism is the mainstream of the biden campaign and it's not the mainstream of america
 remember i said we will never have a socialist country
 on november 3rd
 the people of arizona our great state we love arizona
 i won it last time by a lot
 and i hear we're going to win it by even more this time
 don't forget last time i talked i said we're going to give you a tax cuts i gave you
 i said we're going to give you a massive regulation cuts
 give you your tax cuts i gave them to you
 i said we're going to give you massive regulation cuts we're going to give you great everything
 we even did right to try medicine
 you know all about that
 we did things that i didn't even talk about it we did
 we did a thing called the space force
 you never heard me talking about
 i'm the only candidate that gave you more than i promised in the campaign
 it's true
 i'm the only one ever maybe ever
 or we'll head to the polls and together we'll stop the left and win four more years in the white house
 we're joined today by some incredible people friends of mine great great people
 and i want to congratulate your governor because we had a spike and he knocked that spike out so fast
 i don't know
 are you sure you even had a spike
 doug ducey a great governor great man and a somebody that won by about 16 or 17 points
 that's not so bad
 and i think you're more popular today
 what a job you've done
 thank you very much doug
 a friend of mine and somebody who's a great fighter pilot and i had a lot of people tell me she could really wheel the warthog right
 the warthog
 she said i love that plane but she was a great great fighter pilot one of the best they were telling me
 this was a group and they knew a very well
 a lot of friends you have
 and specifically she said could you extend that plane
 that's the best plane
 it never breaks down
 it just is a winner
 but martha mcsally is an extraordinary person and she's fighting for us and she's helping us and we have to bring her into the center
 thank you martha
 and she's running against a gentlemen who is when you read what he's done when you read what he said about the second amendment and about all other things you're not going to want to vote for
 you're not going to want to have them play with your second amendment
 i'll tell you what
 if i weren't president i don't believe doug you'd have a second amendment right now
 i don't think you'd have
 the pressure that was put on to get rid of it or to basically obliterate it make it so it's meaningless
 you will always have the right to bear arms
 you will always have that
 a few friends of mine who are warriors
 paul gosar
 paul
 where's paul
 paul stand up
 will you
 paul gosar
 thank you paul
 appreciate
 great job you're doing
 these are warriors
 they really are
 when they went and they tried to make a play at your president they had to get through the house
 what were we
 197 and nothing
 that's never happened before
 everybody came together
 the republicans came
 other than mitt romney one half a vote
 one half a brain
 another friend of mine and incredible fighter and somebody that loves his state and i'll tell you the freedom caucus right
 and we have a man named andy biggs here
 he's a fighter
 he's a fighter
 and he loves our vets and he loves our military and you love our second amendment right
 and we're not going to do anything with it
 they will destroy that second amendment
 just remember i said it but you're not going to have to worry about it because it's not going to happen
 a woman who really distinguished herself she became a star
 she became a star overnight
 there was nobody tougher
 there was nobody smarter
 there was nobody better than debbie lesko
 great job debbie
 thank you
 we want her on our side
 right fellas
 we got to have her on our side
 also thanks to arizona republican party chairman i knew this was going to happen
 i knew that she was going
 she never stops
 she never gives up
 kelly ward
 kelly thank you
 thank you kelly
 great job you're doing
 are we winning
 okay good
 i think we are
 that's what they say
 we better win
 if we don't win this country is in big trouble
 big trouble
 also a great friend of all of ours former state treasurer of arizona jeff dewitt
 thank you jeff
 and a man who didn't choke under pressure
 i don't even know if he's here
 i think he might be here
 he never choked
 he kicked for 11 years
 you know what that is
 you ever see a golfer
 they miss a three footer
 they miss a three footer
 they can't take it back
 they choke choke choke
 well kickers are the same
 right
 nfl kickers
 this guy lasted 11 years
 he's one of the best kickers ever
 nfl kicker jay feely
 where's jay
 where is jay
 he's here someplace
 where is he
 jay
 what happened
 you couldn't get a good seat jay
 i remember the 61 yarder
 that was a heartbreaker
 right
 but the only thing is i'll bet you this man would stand only stand for our national anthem
 that's one thing
 that's one thing i can tell you
 and if they don't stand for our flag if they don't stand for our national anthem i turn off the game
 other than that i'd like to watch but i turn off the game
 and by the way i thought they learned that lesson a little while ago
 i thought they learned that lesson two years ago but maybe not but they will
 they'll learn it again
 this time it'll go even faster
 for decades washington politicians like biden allowed an endless supply of illegal foreign labor to decimate american jobs and wages
 also the crime was incredible what happened
 they allowed criminal gangs to menace maim and terrorize innocent citizens
 they came in
 they would maim and terrorize and we have done something with our border patrol
 and by the way ice ice is great
 ice has taken out thousands and thousands of ms-13 and you don't want the job
 there's some tough people here
 none of you want the job
 it's a tough job but they like it and they're great patriots and they've done a fantastic job
 they ceded control of the border to the most dangerous and ruthless cartels on earth
 this is what would happen
 they have ceded
 and what we've done did you ever notice the caravans
 what happened
 debbie there are no more caravans
 what happened
 what happened to the caravans
 they don't come up anymore
 the caravans don't come up
 you know we were paying hundreds of millions of dollars to honduras guatemala el salvador hundreds of millions
 and i said well why are we doing that
 and they wouldn't take
 when we caught a murderer and we wanted to bring it back to one of those countries they wouldn't take him
 and they wouldn't take him under the obama administration
 so we got stuck with them because they'd fly in
 they'd say don't land your plane
 and i said something very simple
 i said that's okay
 we don't have to do that
 we're not going to pay you anymore
 we stopped payment
 we stopped payment
 it's amazing how that works doug
 right
 we stopped payment and they called
 they said we'd love to take them
 we'd be honored to take them
 so we take them back by the thousands by the thousands
 they let lethal poisonous drugs pour freely into our schools and our communities but no more
 it's not happening anymore
 the cruel and heartless portrayal of the american people ended the day i took the oath of office and now that we have more than half of the wall built and do you notice they don't talk about the wall anymore
 they don't talk
 why don't you talk
 i went look at all those people back there
 that's called fake news fake news
 look at them
 it's the fake news
 they don't talk about the wall anymore
 see we won
 we got the wall
 it's going to be up to 300 next week and it's going to be finished very soon
 and as soon as we want all of a sudden they never talk about it
 but you know where i talk about it
 numbers
 the numbers are so good
 the numbers are so low
 we've never had numbers like this because that big portion of wall already built you don't get through it
 you can't get through it
 you can climb mount everest and you're going to have an awful hard time getting over that sucker
 i stood up to the lobbyists
 everybody fought us the democrats everyone
 i fought the special interests
 i kept every single promise that i made and now i'm doing it with the drug companies
 i just created favorite nation
 so if a nation buys it for less and they buy it for a fraction of what we pay the drug companies have to sell it to us for the same price
 and they're spending so much
 they're spending millions of dollars on advertising
 anytime you see an ad from a drug company and they're rich the farmer it's called big farmer the number one lobbyist
 they spend millions and millions hundreds of millions of dollars online
 anytime you see anytime at all you see an ad by big farmer against me you know your drug prices are coming down
 that's what it is
 they're not happy
 and we're giving the rebate that creates tremendous wealth for the middle man the rebate
 it's going to the people now
 we're bringing the rebate and it's going to the people
 they are not happy
 i have a lot of people in that industry do not like me too much
 but you are going to get 50
 you are going to get and the democrats would never do it biden would never do it because he doesn't understand it but they would never do it
 they would in a million years they wouldn't do it
 it took a lot of guts to do it
 i had a lot of people a lot of good politicians go sir i don't think you should do it
 i wonder why you're saying that but we did it
 we're going to have drug prices reduced over a very short period of time by not 2 and last year they went down a little bit first time in 51 years that drug prices went down but a little bit we're going to have prices dropping 50 60 and even 70
 drugs
 about time
 and i'm proud to say that they've achieved the most secure border our border patrol in the history of the united states of america
 we now have the most secure border we've ever had and it's only going to get better
 and we want people to come in but we want them to come in through merit right
 and we want people- … people to come in but we want them to come in through merit right
 and we want people that are going to come in and are going to love for our country not hate our country
 here in yuma arizona we've invested over 1
7 billion and poured 180000 cubic yards that's a lot of concrete to build 108 miles of powerful border wall
 i know who's going to vote for me
 i don't know though i think i'm going to win yuma
 what do you think doug
 i think when i hear those numbers when we hear those numbers we're winning
 we're going to win yuma big
 now you see it and you see what's going up and it's an incredible structure all capable all wired up for cameras for everything you can have
 technology is incredible
 in total i've already completely planned for the final execution we're going to have by the end of the year everything that we said is going to be built
 we may actually build some more in some soft areas that we've noticed over the last two years
 so we actually may put up some additional but we will have it completed everything we said by the end of the year and nobody thought that was possible
 and we've reduced illegal border crossings by 60 since this time last year
 and if we keep going at the rate it'll be about 85 in about two months
 so it's a great honor
 and you know what
 your community is much safer you see the difference it's a much safer place to be
 but more important than these numbers is the fact that we've ended catch and release
 you know what catch and release is
 these great men and women catch somebody maybe a murderer maybe a rapist maybe a trafficker they catch somebody take his name take his number and they release them into our country
 and they say come back in four years you have a trial
 no more
 we take them out
 we bring them out
 and nobody said that was possible because i couldn't have gotten it through the democrats because they don't like that
 so we have people coming in to this country some great people some really bad people too
 and i mean murders and i mean rapist i mean really bad people and they don't get in and they don't get back
 when we bring them back to their country could be mexico also they don't come back
 under the obama biden i call it obiden under the obiden administration our agents were ordered to ignore the law and release illegal aliens by the hundreds of thousands
 and by the way mark morgan where's the great mark morgan
 he's around here someplace
 mark morgan has been so incredible one of our executives he said we never built the cages
 those cages were built in 2014 by obama
 we never the cages they were built by obama and the fake news is constantly saying that i built cages for children
 i didn't build them
 they were built in 2014
 there was a headline in time magazine about the cage and somebody called in that built it
 they said he didn't build it we built that for the obama administration
 but they don't stop they keep calling it they say i built the cages
 you'll hear it in one of the debates
 they'll say you built cages president
 i said no i didn't build cages
 that was built by obama
 under the trump administration if you cross our border illegally you are quickly apprehended and swiftly returned back home
 we are proudly defending the job safety and security of the american people which is what i promised to do
 nobody told me it was going to be this hard
 nobody told me i was going to have the democrats go totally crazy
 this was like a life and death war
 you know why they don't talk about it anymore
 because they know it's bad politics because they know having a wall they can't win that one
 so they just say let's forget it ever happened
' because we won and they say let's forget
 they don't want to talk about it
 that includes the millions of incredible hispanic americans who follow our laws uplift our community and protect our nation in uniform
 half of all border patrol agents are hispanic americans i was just with them
 and today i salute each and every one of those true american heroes and that's what they are
 and nobody understands the border better than hispanics
 they know what's good what's bad
 they don't want bad people coming into our country taking their jobs taking their homes causing crime
 hispanic americans are the people that are most in favor of what we're doing on the border because they understand it
 they understand it better than anybody
 with the help of these patriots we've stopped the rampant asylum fraud shut down the human smugglers and we're finding the drug dealers traffickers predators and we're throwing them to hell in jail or sending them back home
 ms-13 for the first time that you've ever seen this ms-13 is totally on the run
 many of its leaders are right now behind bars and we're deporting its members in record numbers we've never reported
 i can't believe how many there are
 but if biden wins it will be a giant jail break for ms-13 and vicious criminal gangs
 china wants him to win so badly
 iran wants him to win so badly
 when we win i'll have a deal with the red within a month watch because they're dying to make a deal
 but that last hope that biden will win they will own our country china they will own our country
 we made such a great deal
 last week they had the largest order of corn in the history of our country the largest single order
 then they did it again
 you know why they're doing that
 because they know i'm angry because they know i don't care so much anymore
 we made a great trade deal but i don't care
 but it shows you how smart they are doug
 another with normal brain power they'd say well i'm not going to buy any more corn
 that's good
 and we'll just decouple thank you very much
 but they go the opposite
 they buy so much good record numbers soybeans record numbers
 last week biggest ever 42 of our farmers crop is now china over the last little while
 you know why
 because they don't want bad things to happen that's why
 so they're very smart
 when i have every farmer in the country calling and saying please don't do anything
 they're very very smart but we can never forget what china did to this country and did to the world
 the historic achievements that i've discussed today are only a slim fraction of the extraordinary accomplishment that we've all done together in the last four years
 here's just a short list of our landmarks
 really they are landmarks true landmarks
 we instituted a national security travel ban on the world's most dangerous regions including jihadist regions keeping terrorists and extremists out of our country
 everyone said oh that's so bad
 remember when they said oh that's so bad
 i don't think it's so bad at all
 we won the travel ban
 the fake news said we didn't because we lost in the lower court we lost in the second court and we won in the supreme court
 so they said we lost
 can you believe it
 they said we lost debbie because we lost the first two but we won in the supreme court so they said they lost
 i guess technically they're right we lost when it didn't matter
 but we have it
 we have a great travel ban now for countries that are not countries where we want the people coming in
 over the last three years ice officers have made over 380000 arrests of aliens with criminal records including those charged or convicted of over 145000 assaults 40000 sex crimes and 5 800 murders
 over the last three years border patrol and ice have seized over two million pounds of fentanyl heroin meth and other deadly narcotics
 and you see it all the time
 we stripped federal grant funding from deadly sanctuary cities
 they want to have a sanctuary city not going to be like the old days
 we canceled the lawless policies of the previous administration and empowered border agents and ice officers to do their jobs and proudly enforce the laws of the united states of america
 we removed 20000 gang members including 4500 ms-13
 that's pretty good
 who would ever think there's that many
 i entered into three landmark agreements with honduras and el salvador and guatemala to end the abuse of the asylum system
 we cut down that payment that i was talking about substantially and they're still very happy and they are working with us very well and that includes mexico
 right now mexico has 27000 of their soldiers on our southern border helping us to guard our southern border
 and we're giving you the tools to do the job that you signed up for
 that's what we've done
 i entered into a historic partnership with mexico known as the migrant protection protocols to safely return asylum seekers to mexico while awaiting hearings in the united states
 you know about that
 we had to have them in the united states and we captured them we had to keep him here
 i said no no we don't want them here
 we want them outside
 we got sued all over the place that we won
 so now they don't come into the united states they can wait outside
 for the first time ever the united states is now exercising our full legal authority to expedited removal
 we don't have to go through years and years of litigation
 you need perry mason to try and win
 we ended the obama biden policy of giving work permits to newly arriving illegal aliens
 think of that one
 we established the national vetting center the most advanced visa screening system anywhere in the world
 we know so much about the people coming in
 we know the good and we know the bad
 we've suspended refugee
 … good and we know the bad
 we've suspended refugee resettlements from the world's most dangerous regions because nothing is more important than keeping america safe
 to me that's number one
 we've made historic progress to crack down on visa overstays
 you know all about that
 they overstay for years
 they say maybe a night maybe two nights
 well five years later you catch them
 no we ended it
 we issued strict sanctions on countries that failed to take back their own criminals
 we have many countries beyond the four that i mentioned the three plus one many countries
 they all take them back now
 before they weren't taking them back at all
 the last administration simply released these criminals
 we're making sure they go home and we're making sure they stay home
 we don't want them
 we issued regulations to stop the horrible practice of birth tourism
 you know what that is right
 anchor babies you know that right
 anchor babies
 have a baby in our country and you stay for the rest of your life
 congratulations
 you're a citizen for 90 years
 then you bring in your family
 you bring in your family right
 no
 no good
 i implemented a historic public charge regulation to finally and fully enforce the federal requirement that newcomers to our country must be financially self-sufficient they cannot accept welfare for at least five years
 to protect our country and our agents during the pandemic my administration took immediate action to ensure the safe and rapid return of all illegal aliens
 we brought them back
 we have very few in our country now
 we brought them back can you believe it
 to protect us workers i suspended the entry of low wage workers that threatened all of your jobs american jobs and we're finalizing the new h-1b regulations to permanently end the displacement of us workers
 in january after the china virus after the outbreak after the outbreak the china virus outbreak it came from wuhan right
 i swiftly implemented a travel ban on china and i was criticized
 biden opposed the ban
 he said i oppose the ban
 he had no idea what the hell he was doing
 why do you oppose it joe
 i don't know
 they told me to say that
 if we had listened to sleepy joe biden hundreds of thousands of additional american lives would have been lost
 we did a good thing
 that was in january i imposed it very early
 a month later pelosi and all these people said oh no let people come in
 we can't
 we imposed it because china was heavily infected
 then i imposed it in europe also heavily infected with italy and france and spain
 compare our achievements with the insane and lethal policies that biden and bernie sanders want
 the entire biden… harris
 how about her
 is she a great one
 is she
 by the way you talk about guns
 she wants no 2nd amendment
 she wants to raise your taxes to a level you'll be paying your government back for a long time
 she is not the right pick but she was my number one draft pick
 they asked me that
 why do you think
 i said i'm very happy
 they thought i was happy
 they thought i was happy for him
 no i was happy for me
 the biden-harris plan is a step by step recipe for abolishing america's borders
 in the biden bernie manifesto joe biden promises to restore and expand catch and release across the entire us border
 you believe that
 we just got rid of it
 free all illegal aliens from federal detention and close detention facilities this would make removing illegal aliens totally impossible and you would have murderers killers rapists in your midst
 i don't think so
 immediately suspend all removals triggering a tidal wave of really a flood if you think a flood all across our border
 end prosecution of illegal border crosses ensuring that illegal aliens will repeatedly reenter the country over and over again and terminate all protections we have enacted against asylum fraud
 they want to do things that nobody thought was even possible to contemplate
 now this is all simple and i really respect because so far i've only seen about four or five people go down
 because it is hot in here
 but i will tell you this… it's 120
 you know what i said before
 think of yourself at a great spa great sauna where it's 120 degrees and we have to pay a lot of money to be there
 you have to pay a lot of money
 getting off the border getting off illegal protection all of that we are going to lower your taxes further
 we gave you the biggest tax decrease in the history of… the biggest tax decrease in the history of our country
 we decreased your taxes more than anybody has ever done and we're doing more because that's going to spell growth and that's what happened
 companies are moving in like nobody has seen before
 so we're doing that
 massive additional regulation cuts
 we've cut regulations more than any president in the history of our country whether it's four years eight years or in one case more
 i told you already our military is the best it's ever been
 it's got 2
5 trillion worth of new beautiful jets and equipment and rockets and everything
 hopefully we never have to use it
 our nuclear arsenal and hopefully hopefully we never have to even look at it our nuclear arsenal is at a level that it's never ever been before and we have to have it there but we never want to use it
 so we have done things not only on the border the border is one element and to me it's very important
 something that they always say about a president the most important thing a president can do is the appointment of federal judges and supreme court justices
 so by the end of our of not my our first term we will have appointed 300 federal judges and appeals court judges and two supreme court justices
 when it comes to 2nd amendment when it comes to life when it comes to a lot of things that you people live for if you don't have the supreme court and if you don't have the courts in your side you can forget it
 the next president i think will pick two three or even four justices of the supreme court
 they can be on the court for 40 to 50 years
 you pick them young
 they could be on there for 40 to 50 years
 this is going to be the most consequential presidency
 this is going to be the most important and i never thought i'd say it because of what happened four years ago this is going to be the most important election of your life
 so i just want to… thank you
 i just want to say stay healthy stay sharp be careful
 be very careful
 go out and work like hell
 we need every single vote that we can get because it's probably going to be close
 i always assume it's going to be close
 they have these suppression the fakers back there they have the suppression polls where they interview many more democrats than they do republicans
 doug and i were talking about it and they take out registered voters
 it's not registered
 they say most likely to vote voters
 that's what most likely registered they're dead they're old they're not going to go they're not going to do anything
 be careful with your ballots but get out there
