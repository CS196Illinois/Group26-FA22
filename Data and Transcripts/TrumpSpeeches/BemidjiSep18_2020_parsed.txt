there's a lot of people
 that's great
 thank you very much
 thank you very much
 that's a big group of people
 this is on fast notice too
 thank you
 but i'm thrilled to be here with the beautiful great hardworking people of this incredible state
 you're really hardworking american patriots
 that's what you are and a lot of people haven't been treated right until i came along
 we've done a lot of work and a lot of good work and you had your best year ever last year
 the state had the best year you've ever had
 46 days from now we're going to win minnesota and we're going to win four more years in the white house
 one of the most vital issues in this election is the subject of refugees
 you know it
 you know it perhaps better than almost anybody
 lots of luck
 you're having a good time with the refugees
 that's good
 we want to have omar
 he said omar
 that's a beauty
 how the hell did she win the election
 how did she win
 it's unbelievable
 every family in minnesota needs to know about sleepy joe biden's extreme plan to flood your state with an influx of refugees from somalia from other places all over the planet
 well that's what's happened and you like omar a lot don't you
 biden has promised a 700 increase in the manifesto with bernie right
 a 700 increase in the importation of refugees from the most dangerous places in the world including yemen syria and somalia
 congratulations minnesota
 a 700 increase
 good luck minnesota
 enjoy yourselves because if i'm not here if i don't win i don't know where i'm going to be
 but maybe i'll come over to see mike
 i'll come and see mike
 your state will be overrun and destroyed and biden and the radical left win
 that's what's going to happen
 i've been watching it for years
 they haven't treated you right
 they have not treated minnesota right
 thank you
 i'll tell you these hangers are great
 remember this
 it's a friendly protest
 please remember this is not a rally
 you're not allowed to have political rallies of any kind
 you're not allowed to go to church
 you're not allowed to do anything
 the only thing you're allowed to do is run wild through the streets burn down storefronts blow up stores and kill people because that's considered a protest and that they allow you to have
 you don't have to wear masks at protests
 so i said we can't have a rally
 the most we can have is ten people
 but why don't we just call it a protest
 because this is a protest
 it's a protest against stupidity
 speaking about stupidity sleepy joe will turn minnesota into a refugee camp
 think of it
 700 increase
 so you're not happy now
 look at that guy over there
 he's not too thrilled when he hears this
 700 increase is what they have in the manifesto
 now maybe they don't honor it but i would say they'll go substantially higher than that number
 biden will overwhelm your children's schools overcrowd their classrooms and inundate your hospitals
 that's what'll happen
 biden has even pledged to terminate our travel ban to jihadist regions jihadist regions
 they've already been doing that to you haven't they
 opening the flood gates to radical islamic terrorists
 my administration's keeping terrorists extremists and criminals the hell out of our country
 we don't want them
 we don't want them
 we've got enough of them
 we've got enough of them
 just today we deported as you know very well dozens of somali nationals charged or convicted with very grave crimes including rape assault robbery terrorism and murder of course
 these hardened criminals are back in their country where they do all the complaining they want and your children are much safer as a result
 thank you president trump
 thank you
 if it were up to biden and it's not
 it's the people that's around him
 they are seriously radical left democrats and they're very dangerous
 the offenders are very dangerous and they'd be running all over your state
 only by voting for me are you going to say … but i hate to say this and get it with your iron ore
 i did it with some other things and i'll do it for you again
 i'll do it for you again
 but if you vote for me i'm the difference and i'm the wall
 you know the wall that we're building on the southern border
 i'm your wall between the american dream and chaos
 joe biden is wholly owned and controlled by the left wing mob
 he has no clue where he is
 this is not a sharp guy
 years ago i said to a certain senator who i was very friendly with a democrat who's the dumbest senator
 who's the smartest senator
 he gave me a name for the smartest
 i said who's the dumbest
 oh joe biden
 you didn't know that
 that was 25 years ago
 that was in prime time
 this is no longer prime time for sleepy joe
 they do disinformation
 they make things up and they make commercials
 they make things up
 i've never seen anything like it
 everything they make up
 first of all i'm the one protecting your social security
 they say trump … remember four years ago they used to say oh trump will get rid of social … i have protected your social security
 they're going to destroy your social security
 remember
 did you ever hear of a man fiorello la guardia
 did you ever
 i don't think that happened with him
 new york i don't think it happened with rudy giuliani did it
 what a great job rudy did
 you realize rudy's just now really being appreciated
 people forgot how good he was as a man
 he was a great mayor
 we polled it
 i'd go down about 22 points
 they want to poll everything nowadays
 i don't believe in polls
 they poll everything
 but ali velshi i don't know anything about the guy but i know he was standing there
 this is really quite a good scene
 it's a friendly protest
 everyone's acting … and behind him the entire city was burning
 it's one of the great pictures of all time
 the entire city was burning down
 that was your city and it's a shame it took so long but the governor finally did it at least
 if you take a look at portland the governor can't quite do it
 she can't get there
 i speak to her all the time
 come on governor
 i can straighten out portland
 give me less than an hour
 just let us have it for … because the state has to ask for it
 they have to request
 it's a shame
 it's such a shame
 but in your case we went and all of a sudden it was really … that was going to be a bad night too right
 remember that about seven o'clock
 then you see this guy walked out with about a 250000 outfit on
 that's because it had more computers and this and that
 got the tear gas deal
 he's got the whole deal pepper spray got everything the finest outfit you can buy
 believe me
 we just paid for them and they were very expensive
 so we see one the helmet
 how about the helmet with the goggles
 you can see at night
 you can see at day
 you can see whenever the hell you want
 so there's one
 i said oh that's only one guy
 then you see another three then four
 then you see another ten
 they were just getting out of the buses coming from very friendly territory
 he got hit on the knee with a canister of tear gas and he went down
 he was down
 my knee my knee
 nobody cared
 these guys didn't care
 they moved them aside and they just walked right to … it was the most beautiful thing and that would be it
 but so they had four or five lines
 then they had lines of different … everybody did the same thing
 did they ever even move one step back
 i don't think so right
 it was just a slow walk right forward
 then they just started walking faster faster faster put a lot of guys in jail tom right
 put a lot of guys … great congressman by the way
 put a lot of guys in jail
 great
 not good
 great
 they put a lot of guys in jail that night tom and that was the end of it
 i don't think he had any problem after that
 if you had any flare-ups we'll send them in again
 but that's all you do
 these are democrat-run disasters
 look at chicago
 look at portland
 look at you with minneapolis
 these are disasters
 by the way are they still trying to get rid of your police force in minneapolis
 that's what i heard
 see they never learn
 they never learn
 they don't … you've got a lot of people here
 that's a lot of people
 i actually like these
 we have the arenas
 we've always filled them up
 it's been great and the arenas are good but usually you have to travel 45 minutes
 this thing you have a hangar
 the plane becomes your backstop right
 it's like your curtain
 it's a curtain
 you get a free curtain
 we're outside which actually makes people happy
 it even makes the people that sometimes not everybody here likes happy because outside is better
 it's better and we're rounding the turn on covid by the way
 our vaccines are coming
 a lot of things are happening
 we're rounding the turn
 we've done a great job
 we've done a phenomenal job
 we don't get credit for that but we'll discuss that in a minute
 but when you look at it when you look at it our country is amazing
 it's an amazing country
 we love this country and we're not going to let radical left socialistcommunists take over our country
 okay
 they use the word socialist and socialists aren't great
 but communists are a hell of a lot worse and that's where we'd be headed
 we're standing in the way of them this group of people
 but you have a lot of groups of people just like this every place we go
 last night you know where we were
 you saw that it was all over the place right
 that's a big state
 that's a great state
 then i see the fake polls
 i just saw a poll here minnesota
 i'm down nine
 i don't think so
 i mean i just don't think so
 i don't think so right
 i don't think so
 it's the craziest thing i've ever seen
 this is the craziest thing i've seen
 president trump is down nine in minnesota
 now i just saw another plane
 see the plane
 the good thing about these beautiful air force ones right
 that's the smaller version of air force one
 i think you had a little bit short runway
 so they take the smaller to save about 12
 no they took the smaller one
 but the great thing about those beautiful planes they have more televisions than any plane in history
 we have televisions in the closet on the ceilings on the floors
 i've never seen them on the … we have them all over the place and i'm just coming out
 they said there he is
 they said it's a smattering of people
 they called it a smattering
 they always do that
 yet biden with the circles right
 the little circles
 he's got like four people in a circle
 you know why he does the circles
 because he can't draw a crowd
 so they put a circle like he's supposed to … he's trying to be legitimate
 he's going to go by the science
 he always says science
 he doesn't know what the word science is
 so to have these four or five circles they put people that way he doesn't have to be embarrassed when he goes to a high school gymnasium and he has 40 50 people
 they had one not so long ago and you saw this
 he couldn't draw a crowd
 it was a big thing
 it was his opening or something
 couldn't draw a crowd
 so they made it a round table
 so he went in
 they only had like 32 people
 they said this is very embarrassing one of his people and that's what they do
 they're good
 some of the people surrounding him they'll say anything and do anything
 they said let's not make it a speech
 there's nobody here
 let's make it a round table
 so these people are sitting at a table
 they had no idea and most of them didn't know anything about politics
 they didn't even know why they were there
 now they're sitting on a round table and they're on television
 but that's what it is
 but they say we had a smattering of people
 yes smattering of about what
 15000 people in about two days' notice
 this doesn't include the 10000 people mike that they turned away
 i hate that they turned them away
 you'd think with an airport you wouldn't have to turn anybody away but they have a certain amount
 then sometimes you have democrats running an airport and they don't like all these people here
 that's true
 they don't like it
 but if we're up to biden your state would be in ruins
 just take a look at what they've done and i'm going to hit it hard
 they make phony commercials about me and it gives me the right
 how about the worst one of all the worst i've ever seen
 standing on a grave of a fallen soldier and then they had some guy a source said … there's no source
 the source doesn't exist
 they make it up and then they take it
 it's called disinformation
 you're not supposed to do that
 i'm not even sure if he knows
 he's too weak to understand and he's still weak to control his people
 but it allows me to say whatever i want about this guy
 the truth is he's not fit to be your president
 he's not mentally fit
 if biden's elected extremists like representative ilhan omar … whatever happened to her
 you had a great writer who has just made a living off writing about her
 she's done so many criminal acts
 isn't it damn disgraceful that she gets away with it
 i have to say to myself i say how the hell did she get away with that
 if we do one … look at general flynn
 he didn't even lie
 they said he didn't lie right
 he's gone through hell
 he's gone through hell
 this guy wrote page after page of criminal acts
 well let's see what happens
 who the hell knows
 but between her and how about aoc
 aoc- aoc is running a campaign against the guy that was supposed to be speaker of the house
 right
 joe crowley
 i knew him a little bit
 i asked him once i said are you campaigning against this maniac
 he said no she's just a young girl
 no problem
 i called him on election night
 nah i was going to i was going to say how did that work out joe
 that didn't work
 he was going to be speaker of the house
 he's got a certain talent
 but you know she had no money nothing
 and all of a sudden she had 2000000 and she spent the 2000000 all over the place
 her and her boyfriend
 whatever happened to her
 can you imagine if i'd do that
 you have to look at that
 she spent the 2000000 and big story
 but that was it
 that's one quick story
 oh man
 probably the guy who wrote the story lost his job at the new york times
 right
 he's now unemployed but there's a big story
 she spent 2000000 on bullshit
 if a republican did that they'd be in jail
 you know that
 it's a different standard and it's a disgrace
 and our guys better get on the ball
 look let me tell you how about yesterday
 they were talking about russia russia russia
 again here we go with the russia
 there's never been anybody so tough on russia with the sanctions
 remember obama would send pillows
 i sent tank busters right to ukraine
 i'm the one that exposed the pipeline with germany
 germany pays them billions and billions of dollars
 and then we're supposed to protect germany from russia
 i said how does that work
 how does that work
 you're spending billions of dollars for energy to russia
 it's all okay
 i'm the one that exposed it
 what i've done … hey they don't want me to go
 but if you look they don't want me to win
 russia doesn't want … maybe north korea does because i actually have a very good relationship with him
 and speaking of north korea and you know it's okay to have really
 you don't have to go to wars
 we don't have to lose our great soldiers
 it's good
 if i got along with putin
 somebody said he gets along well with putin
 i'm saying to myself but isn't that sort of a good thing
 is that bad
 he gets along with putin
 that's a bad thing
 but you saw the head of the fbi yesterday started going russia
 russia is looking at our election
 russia
 here we go again
 russia russia russia
 i said what about china
 what about north korea
 what about iran
 what about …  they don't mention anybody else
 the narrative seems to be russia
 millions of phone calls made not one to russia
 millions of phone calls received not one to russia
 then he goes russia russia
 then they asked him about antifa
 what do you think about antifa
 well it's an ideology
 i said no it's not
 it's a bunch of thugs and anarchists that are being funded by somebody and find out who the somebody is
 it's unbelievable
 unbelievable when you look at this stuff
 but seriously take a look at the aoc
 i call it aoc plus three
 her three people that she tells what to do
 and 2000000
 dresses rent other things
 you're not supposed to do that
 mr
 congressman are you allowed to do that sir
 you don't do that
 you don't buy dresses do you
 if he does that's the end of his career right
 no
 but it's terrible
 right john
 it's terrible
 will prosecute him
 i mean why not
 i don't understand it
 i'll tell you what
 one friend of mine very sophisticated guy very successful guy called me up
 he says you know
 from the day you came down the escalator with our great first lady our future first lady
 he said from that day the people love her
 she gave a great speech at the republican national convention at the white house
 she gave a great speech
 but said from the day you came down the escalator with our first lady
 from the single day you've been under investigation
 you've been under investigation by sleazebags
 people that now we caught cleaned up their phones
 you're not allowed to do that
 right mr

 congressman
 my great hockey player
 you're the greatest
 right
 but you're not allowed to do that
 you know
 we want their phones
 oh here they are
 oh by the way they happen to be totally deleted
 like hillary with the 33000 emails she deleted
 if she is she's not getting her money worth
 her yoga lessons and her daughter's wedding
 right
 so it was about the wedding and the yoga lessons
 so i said okay let's give her five or six each
 what do you think mike
 five or six each
 five for the wedding
 make it 30
 make it a hundred
 make it a thousand
 a thousand for the wedding
 and for the yoga let's give her 200
 okay
 what about all those thousands and thousands of emails
 probably classified
 so congress … so forget about it
 let's assume they're gone because she deleted them and then she acid washed them
 and then she hit her phones with a hammer
 i get rid of phones
 i've never hit him with a hammer
 not even as president
 i say yeah
 throw the phone away
 no no
 i've never hit a phone
 has anybody ever gotten rid of your phone and taken a hammer and wiped the hell out of it
 i don't think so
 so she gets a subpoena from the u s congress
 not in a lawsuit against some guy that hates you and you're fighting and you're fighting or something
 by the way you do that you've got problems in court big problems
 but she gets a subpoena from congress
 u
s
 subpoena the most important subpoena you can get
 they get the subpoena
 and after she gets the subpoena by a few days everything is deleted
 her phones are busted up and cleaned and wiped
 and everything's gone
 and nothing happens to her
 forget about what was on
 now think of how angry it makes me when i see it
 now how angry
 could you imagine if i'd do that it's a whole different ball game
 know how angry it makes me when i see it
 and we had an attorney general that didn't have a clue
 that was my fault
 i was loyal to somebody
 endorsed me early
 you know whey he endorsed me
 because i went to mobile alabama
 we had 55000 people show up at a stadium
 he said i'd like to endorse you
 then after we won he said i'd love to be attorney general
 and i said no i don't think so
 but after four or five times asking i'm a loyal person and i did it
 the mistakes sometimes you make is because of loyalty but that's okay
 but allowed her to get away with that is a disgrace
 maybe there's something they can do
 so forget about looking for the emails
 and they are available
 and i guarantee they're in the state department
 i guarantee you they're in the state department that ought to damn well find them
 they're being protected in the state department
 but forget about that
 almost as good is the fact that you're not allowed to do what she did and her lawyers should pay kendall should pay equal consequence
 equal consequence
 equal
 but that's the way it is
 but we are making a lot of progress if you see what's going on
 i said to myself i'm going to stay uninvolved
 i don't have to
 chief law enforcement officer can you believe it
 but i think it's better if i stay uninvolved
 and i have stayed uninvolved and we do have an excellent attorney general
 bill barr
 and i'll be honest he's a smart guy
 i think he's getting tougher and tougher and tougher every day
 i think he's not going to put up with this stuff
 i don't think
 and you know he's got a lot of people that are deep staters whatever you want to call them
 they fight him at every turn
 they fight him fight him fight him
 but he's getting tougher and tougher
 i watched over the last three days i'm saying wow that's sort of what we're all waiting for
 right
 but she deletes her emails
 aoc gets rid of 2000 000
 gets rid of it
 nothing happens
 nothing happens
 and then she goes around and calls us all like what the hell are we
 and she controls nancy pelosi
 actually nancy pelosi would love to get rid of her i think
 how about pelosi
 pelosi goes out and says you know
 i think i have my hair done
 so she goes out and she goes into this beauty parlor
 i told the story in wisconsin last night
 by the way we had that great crowd in wisconsin
 you have a feeling about places
 you know the problem with minnesota is that i think since 1972 this hasn't been won by a republican
 so you're a little behind the eight ball when you hear that
 right
 i mean i can understand
 and wisconsin rarely
 but i won wisconsin
 unlike minnesota thank you very much
 thank you very much tom
 thank you
 unlike minnesota
 but it's my fault
 so i had one speech left
 it started at one in the morning
 i went to michigan we won michigan
 that was another one
 great state
 we brought back so many auto companies into michigan
 we brought them back
 but i had one
 it was already voting day
 it was election day
 because by the time i got there it was just scheduled
 had i made that one damn stop to your state we would have won minnesota
 i lost by what
 a half a point
 half a point
 but i get off the plane and they said he's in minnesota
 he's down nine
 the recent poll
 down nine
 i believe it's a suppression poll
 and you know i have an instinct about things pretty much
 somebody said trump has the greatest political instincts of the last 100 years
 one of my enemies said that
 and i said no i don't
 i don't believe i do
 i think i have lousy political instincts
 but what am i going to tell you
 let me just say they said that
 and i was very impressed by the statement
 in fact i went to my wife i said you know they say i have the greatest political instincts in over a hundred years
 and i said but i don't believe it
 i don't
 i don't want to be beto
 remember beto
 i was born to run for president
 that was the end of his career
 beto o'rourke who's in charge of guns
 by the way he's going to take your guns away
 you know that right
 biden
 sleepy joe
 sleepy joe is going to take your guns away
 remember beto on the cover of a really crummy magazine
 i won't mention the name
 they've got a lot of bad magazines out there
 the good news is most of them are dying
 if not all of them
 but beto o'rourke he did the story and he was going to defeat ted cruz
 he was going to do all these things
 ted beat him
 and i helped a lot too
 i was with ted all the way
 and i think ted's appreciated it
 but i even said i'm putting ted cruz as one of the people for the supreme court
 right
 and you know why i did it
 you know why i did it
 because i wanted to make sure that i had somebody on a list we had about 45 unbelievable people unbelievable
 the smartest the best
 the absolute creme de la creme right
 the best minds in the country
 conservative
 they believe in the constitution
 little things like that
 but i said you know
 i have to have somebody that we're going to make sure we get approved
 and the only one i could think of is ted because he's going to get 50 republican votes and he's going to get 50 democrat votes
 they'll do anything to get them out of the senate
 right
 so anyway but just to finish there's no way that i'm nine points down
 i look at a crowd
 so they say instinct right
 so i look at a crowd and whether i have good instinct or not this is not the crowd of somebody that's going to finish second in the state to a sleepy joe
 finish second to a guy that cannot put two sentences together
 now it is an ideology
 it doesn't matter
 i could put that broken piece of wood right there
 i could put that out
 and it's the same thing as joe
 it's just an ideology
 it's just an idea
 now historically we have the biggest gap in enthusiasm of any campaign that they've ever opposed
 you heard that
 like 36 points
 in other words they've got no enthusiasm for him
 i have tremendous enthusiasm as we can tell
 but he does have enthusiasm to beat trump
 his only enthusiasm is put anybody in there
 right
 put anybody in there
 he does have enthusiasm to beat trump
 nothing for him but to beat trump
 okay
 but historically that never wins
 when somebody has to rely on winning because of somebody as opposed to winning because people love you people respect you … and sean hannity did something the other night
 he said to this man if you owned a mcdonald's hamburger stand in a reasonably busy area would you have joe biden running that stand
 the answer is no
 he doesn't have the energy
 he doesn't
 so he can't run the country
 no seriously
 i thought it was good
 i never thought of it
 you wouldn't have him running your business
 you wouldn't have him running a mcdonald's
 i have to say or a wendy's
 i have a friend he owns wendy's
 he always gets up
 ken you haven't mentioned wendy's
 okay
 but you know you wouldn't do it because he couldn't do it
 and yet he's running for the presidency
 he's got no energy
 i made a comment that somebody had low energy
 that was the end of his political career
 but joe's energy is far lower
 it's far lower
 no it's far lower than jeb
 jeb was on the low side
 but joe he's off the scale
 right
 joe's got nothing going
 today biden delivered remarks barely to a union after spending 47 years giving their jobs to china and foreign countries in exchange for campaign cash
 how about his statement
 hey we talk about aoc being crooked
 she's a hundred percent crooked
 okay
 but were talking about that
 look at omar
 she came in here
 did she marry her brother
 where's that writer
 that writer should be given the pulitzer prize
 he never will be
 he should be though
 you know the amazing thing all of these writers new york times washington post right
 russia russia russia
 trump
 russia russia russia
 i had 19 people
 all brilliant
 all radical left
 all hillary people
 actually not even a never trumper from bush
 okay
 all hillary clinton people mostly almost everyone
 they were all democrats
 how about this
 you're being investigated by 19 democrats that are smart people
 okay
 smart people
 so my friend says you know you are the most honest person in the world
 and you've taken three years of total investigation
 you don't think they've gone over my taxes
 they went over at the biggest tax firm in the country
 the most prestigious
 they went over everything
 they spend 48 million as it comes out now
 it's about 48000000 investigating me before i won and after i won
 and we caught them spying on my campaign
 that's what they were really doing
 and now with the phones i think there's like 22 or 24 people
 you heard this one
 they said no no no
 we made a mistake when we deleted our phone
 you know what they had to do to make that mistake
 like 19 different formulas
 right
 i don't even know how you delete a phone
 i didn't know you could do it
 but they all made the exact same mistake
 that's not good
 that's not good
 so let's see what happens to them
 it's a criminal act you know that right
 it's a criminal act
 it's criminal
 weissman's a bad guy
 put a lot of people in jail that shouldn't be in jail weissman
 he's a bad guy
 he's on cnn all the time or msnbc which i call it msdnc
 because it's the same thing
 owned by a company called concast
 did anyone ever hear … with an n not an m
 con like a con job
 concast
 they a fortune on public relations
 comcast has delivered you the news all the news
 and they spend a fortune
 and then i go up and make one speech and i call them concast and that's the end of the pr for the year
 they are a bad group of people
 they're sick
 i mean they're sick people
 they're sick and evil people and they want bad things for our country and they don't report the news
 you know in the old days when you used public airways free you had to get a license
 i keep saying if they're reporting fake news how come they can keep getting a license
 whether it's abc whether it's nbc cbs or of course cnn
 which is i mean one of the great jokes of all time cnn
 or msdnc
 but they're cable so i guess there's a different standard
 but when you're using the public airwaves free
 okay
 free
 aren't you supposed to get licensed
 so i asked my people that
 i ask a couple of guys and i never really get an answer
 i just want to know a simple question
 do you have to report the truth when you using free airwaves and making a fortune with commercials and everything else
 and i never get the right answer because there are people down deep
 it's crazy
 but we're getting down to all of it
 a lot of progress has been made
 i think you're starting to see it
 we're trying to beat a terrible group of deep state people
 you know i came to washington … think of it think of it
 i came to washington and i had 24 years of putting people in office
 and then you can probably add another four to that
 and another four to that
 i had many many years decades of people putting … so i came
 been to washington i guess 17 times i never stayed over
 right
 never slept over
 i was there 17 times
 but we're riding down the beautiful pennsylvania avenue
 and i look outside at those police
 i love our police
 we've got to treat our police better
 i had everything
 i had police
 i had military
 i had soldiers
 i had everything you could possibly have
 you never saw so much how power and strength and beauty
 the beauty
 and they were so proud
 they're all saluting they're so proud
 they're happy to have gotten rid of that crowd that was there before us
 they're proud
 they're great
 the police
 you know every single police force i think endorsed me
 i got the one yesterday from chicago
 that's not easy
 chicago endorsed me
 new york's finest endorsed me
 florida
 ohio
 i mean everybody
 i don't know that he's gotten one vote
 then he says he can't mention the words law and order
 can you believe it
 and then i get to the most beautiful house in the world
 i can have mar-a-largo and all of them
 but i'll tell you the white house is still the white house no matter how you do it
 and i get to this gorgeous beautiful place
 and i'm up at the incredible suite level and there's abraham lincoln's suite
 it's called the lincoln bedroom
 remember clinton used to lease it out to people for money
 they never change do they
 remember when barbara streisand she's another beauty by the way
 but remember barbara streisand used to stay in that suite
 which was the only problem i had with it
 but tell me … no but i do like her voice
 i do
 i really do
 some of them i don't like even their voices
 but she used to stay there
 and i'm standing in the lincoln bedroom
 the history of the whole thing
 the bed the desk the gettysburg address the beautiful four score and seven years ago
 this beautiful gettysburg address
 he wrote it there
 and also on his carriage ride up to gettysburg
 he delivered the gettysburg address and they say the only one that got worse press than i did was abraham lincoln
 did anyone ever hear that
 and i said no way they got worse
 maybe he got bad
 but no way he gets worse
 now people are starting to say it's probably true
 i think you've got the worst
 now they used to say no no
 newt gingrich great guy
 he said nope abraham lincoln got the worst press
 they were worse to him than anybody
 he was a very depressed person
 his wife was very depressed
 it was a depressed kind of a thing
 he's in a war he's in a revolution
 and he was getting beaten a lot by robert e
 lee
 they want to rip his statue down all over the place
 but robert e
 lee whether you like statues or not they don't rip statues down anymore
 i signed a law
 10 years in jail if they rip them down
 but robert e
 lee won many many battles in a row and it was supposed to be over in one day
 it was supposed to end immediately because the north was too powerful for the south
 but it just shows when you have leaders when you have a great general
 and robert e
 lee he would have won except for gettysburg
 and that was because his general was killed who's going to lead gettysburg
 never fight uphill me boys
 never fight uphill
 he heard they were going up hill
 stop them stop them
 but we had no cell phones in that day right
 congressmen
 no cell phones
 so they sent the horses to stop him
 stop him
 but it was too late
 they fought uphill and they got slaughtered
 that's what happened
 but robert e
 lee these were incredible things
 but i hope you appreciate that we had a period of time when they were ripping down all of the statues and monuments
 and i said to my people four months ago i said this is crazy
 these people
 and they don't even know
 they started ripping down abraham lincoln
 when they hit lincoln i said wait a minute
 this is the man
 and you can't do … then they hit george washington thomas jefferson
 they hit everybody
 they even had gandhi
 all gandhi wanted was one thing
 peace
 may we have peace
 rip down the statue we don't like it
 i don't think they have any idea what they're doing
 i think they're just a bunch of thugs
 okay
 you want to know that
 i think they are a bunch of thugs
 they were going to march on washington and they were going to rip down a statue of abraham lincoln
 you know the exact statute
 its up very nicely
 up now
 and by the way they can take them down legally
 they go through congress as a way of doing it
 but they didn't want to do it that way
 and they were marching on washington
 and i said do we have any laws about this
 they said no sir
 now in congress the way it is now the most you get is about a 10 fine
 you rip down a 5 million statue and you got a 10 fine
 right
 it's different world
 that's when it was strong and they had laws
 but we told and found this old act
 and the old act said if you rip down a monument or a statue you get 10 years in prison
 they call it prison not jail which sounds even worse
 i said bring that sucker up immediately to the oval office because there are a lot of people coming to washington
 they were going to march on the jefferson memorial
 do you believe that
 the jefferson memorial
 we grow up … the jefferson memorial
 they were going to march on the jefferson memorial
 they were going to do damage to our beautiful jefferson memorial after thomas jefferson
 and i did predict that
 a friend of mine said you know two years ago you said next will be robert e
 lee and then comes washington
 and jefferson and lincoln
 they'd never stop
 the only thing they understand is strength
 remember that
 they don't understand weakness
 there's nothing you can do
 these really stupid heads of these corporations that give hundreds of millions of dollars
 it's like blackmail money right
 but these stupid people that run they get 40000000 a year and they're weak
 okay they're weak
 but these people they're anarchists and the only thing they understand is strength
 so i said let me see this document
 i said wow this is a very strong document
 and derek is here
 one of my attorneys he did a great job
 i don't know where the hell derek is
 he's around here
 actually he's heard this before though
 not quite
 you're getting a very unique speech tonight
 you know
 i mean unlike joe i haven't even looked at the teleprompter
 this guy will move it up
 move it up
 i can't see
 move it up
 i haven't looked at it
 the poor teleprompter guy he's sitting there what do we do
 we're on line two of the teleprompter
 he said what do we do
 no unlike joe i have not looked at the teleprompter
 oh that poor joe
 you know what's the worst part about him looking at the teleprompter
 the worst part is that means that the fake news media is giving him the questions
 right
 like donna brazil who was brilliantly hired by fox
 fox has changed a little bit
 ladies and gentlemen donna brazil who was fired by cnn because she cheated and she gave crooked hillary the questions to the debate
 how would you like to be me
 they give her questions to the debate
 and i still won the debate and she had all the questions
 think of it
 how do you do that
 donna brazil is ladies and gentlemen she's going to work for fox
 oh that's great
 that's big difference
 big difference between four years ago and now
 a lot of things have changed
 but i'll tell you what's changed is the fact that we have more enthusiasm now than we did four years ago
 it's amazing right
 but just to get back to the others
 so i signed that wonderful executive order instituting this really tough law
 and it says 10 years
 it doesn't say you get 10 years but you can take it down to three weeks
 it says 10 years
 so these guys had just gotten there
 i had a news conference because i had to let them know about it
 right
 we've got many people in jail right now from before nobody even talked about taking statues down
 no but i looked at the andrew jackson right
 with the ropes
 and i'll tell you the police did a great job
 and mark meadows did a great job
 he said charge
 they charged
 and they took these guys out and they were fairly tough
 but the police were much tougher
 dc police
 they did a great job
 they were watching and they weren't able to do anything
 mark meadows said charge
 it was like from 200 years ago it was crazy
 they charged and they'd beat the hell out of these guys
 or you wouldn't have that great statue on the horse of a great general
 he was a great general
 and he was a very good president
 at least a good president
 but he was a great general
 the battle of new orleans
 right
 he went to jail too
 we had all the evidence we needed
 thank you for that
 i want to thank you fake news
 we called the fake news
 we said can we just have that please
 when they said no we just said we'll take it off tivo
 that's okay
 don't worry about it
 one of the greatest inventions in history
 tivo better than television because television is useless without it
 so we signed it
 and all of a sudden these same guys who were watching it they left
 nobody showed up the next day
 they're going to have 25000 people
 they had 24 people 5 of them were brought to prison
 okay
 and the next day they said well we were going to save it for saturday night
 and saturday night nobody showed up
 and nobody has showed up in four months to take down a statue
 it's true
 because you know why
 they look and they say i want to take down that statue
 i'm going to take down that statue
 that statue's coming down
 and then somebody says you know it's 10 years in jail
 they go that's too much
 i'm getting out of here
 it's true
 ten years is not acceptable mike
 right
 ten years is a lot to rip down a statue have a little fun especially when they have no idea what they're ripping down
 but we have an idea what they're ripping down
 they're ripping down in many cases greatness
 they're ripping down our past
 they're ripping down our history
 and that's where these guys begin
 they take away your history
 you look at the middle east you look all over
 look what isis did
 look what all of them do
 they go down and they rip
 they go into museums and they break everything and they rip everything
 they want to take away your past
 they're not taking away the past of the united states of america
 not as long as i'm here
 what do you want
 do you want me to go back on teleprompter anybody
 okay
 here's the question
 my poor guy must be having a fit
 he's over there
 he's so good at this stuff
 he's on line three
 … good at this stuff
 he's on line three
 he said sir should i use turn the sucker off
 would you rather go teleprompter or freelance
 isn't it nice when you have the option because you have this and you have the option to go either
 see joe doesn't have the option
 he doesn't have the option
 but if biden wins china wins and it's very simple
 it's very simple
 by contrast i rescued the minnesota iron range i did that
 just so you know o-biden
 i call him o-biden it's too long to say obama and biden so i just go o-biden because i don't care about… everyone said oh no he's in trouble
 obama's now campaigning
 hey he campaigned last time harder than hillary
 i said no i want him to campaign because he brings out the base
 he brings out our base
 and i'm only here because of him and joe
 i'm only here because of him
 i could right now be having a very beautiful life of luxury and here i am at the hangar in minnesota with 15 or 20 or 25000 people
 and thousands of people that couldn't get in and i'm working my ass off
 i could be at home having a good time wonderful time
 but the one thing i said is- we want trump
 we want trump
 we want trump
 but i say this
 i say this look i could be home
 so home was new york
 i had to bail out because it was too crazy everything has fallen apart
 but home it's so sad what the democrats have done to our great new york
 between a governor and a mayor the crime is through the roof the corruption is incredible it's a sad thing that's happened to new york
 hopefully it'll come back by somebody
 somebody will go in there and do like a rudy
 you know when rudy took over it was so bad and they were looking for somebody and they thought he was the guy because he was a tough guy
 but somebody has to go in and clean it up
 this mayor he let go of a billion dollars worth of police
 he actually believed the nonsense about defunding the police
 and they're all going to do it
 they're all going to do it
 and new york people are going to do it
 i'm being totally serious now
 you've got to go out and you've got to vote for trump
 you got to break this spell from 1972
 you saw kenosha
 what we did for other places you saw the kenosha and that was gone
 that was all gone
 that place was gone
 we sent in the troops it was incredible what we did and they did it on day three
 day three is better than two weeks later like in minneapolis
 but they did it and we've done a great job and the people of that great state they understand it and i just hope the people of your state of minnesota understand it because we don't have too many more chances with this stuff
 we really don't
 we don't have the luxury of sitting back and saying let's have four years of this maniac vice president that he picked who treated him worse than any other person
 that's why i say the one person that he won't pick… my great instincts right
 the one person he won't pick is kamala because she called him a racist she tried to me-too him
 he was me-too'd
 i've just been me-too'd darling what does that mean
 but they tried to me-too him
 and she was the one that brought it up
 remember tara
 she was the one that brought it up and then he goes ladies and gentlemen i'd like to pick… wait a minute let me get her name here
 how do you pronounce it
 it's with a comma like a comma right
 like a comma
 remember he couldn't pronounce her name
 he was saying her name wrong and she had to interrupt him
 no my name is kamala
 like comma
 i remember that
 like a comma
 h1n1 that's right joe
 remember that joe h1n1
 and how bad did he do in that though
 how about that
 how bad did he do
 so come to think of it he's out there now today
 it was pathetic
 by the way did you see the anderson cooper thing last night
 you have to watch
 i don't want to watch but i have an obligation
 i'm competing against somebody
 you don't want to compete and say i'm not going to watch my competition who wouldn't
 it's boring but i got to watch
 and he got through it
 he met a couple of really… the chicken thing was bad
 he said chicken many many times and it was a little strange that i thought it was over and he pulled it back
 he was able to pull it back
 but anderson is a… and he interviewed me he's tough
 you know he can be tough nothing against him
 he could be very tough but last night he was in rare form
 he was thank you very much for being here mr
 vice president are you enjoying the run
 and compare that with my shot where they asked me about doing abc with george stephanopoulos
 i think it was great
 i think it worked out great
 you know what i call it
 debate prep
 i call that free debate prep
 but you know it's nasty it's a little nasty that people… and i didn't say no you got to change the rules
 no give me the questions
 i want to use a teleprompter to answer
 how about that though
 mr
 vice president i'd like to know your feeling on nuclear warfare and how does that relate to china and russia and where are they in the race
 well you can't have this as your president
 i don't care
 forget about me
 you can't do this
 the importance and the power of this position are too great
 you can't do it
 i've learned a lot as president
 but one thing i learned is that president xi of china is sharp
 you ever see him standing with the two million men walking in front everybody's the same height they're wearing hats everyone's like a pool table right
 and he's standing there by himself and he's looking like he's not playing games
 there's no games he's sharp as you can be
 and i had a great relationship but now i feel differently
 we made a great trade deal and now i feel differently
 but he's a sharp as you can be
 putin as sharp as you can be
 kim jong un we would have been in a war with north korea 100
 i asked obama did you ever call him
 he said that was the toughest problem we had
 and we get along
 remember about a month ago two months ago they broke into the demilitarized zone and they said oh he's going to attack
 i said no he's not
 don't worry about it
 i got to know him very well
 we have a good relationship
 people said he has a good relationship with kim jong un that's terrible
 i said no that's good
 but you remember it was going to be a nuclear war and i got along with him
 then they said trump made a terrible deal
 he's given so much to north korea
 what did i give
 i was at like a semi debate with his idiot a reporter
 he's given a lot to north korea
 what did i give
 i don't know
 sanctions sanctions
 you took away
 no i didn't
 actually i increased the sanctions very substantially
 what did you give
 what did i give
 tell me
 so after about four days they couldn't ask because i gave nothing except i gave heart because i don't want to see people killed on their side either
 i don't want to see people killed
 we'd win that
 we'd win them all
 we have the greatest weapons right now ever conceived by man
 we've rebuilt our military to a level that nobody ever thought possible
 and then the fake news
 and i said that a couple of weeks ago remember i said we have created the most powerful weapons known to man
 it's true
 we have weapons that are so advanced that president xi putin everybody we're the envy of the world
 but they don't know quite what we have but they know we have stuff that they never even heard of before
 and some schmuck back there said i think he's given away classified information
 now all i'm doing is telling the world we have the most powerful weapons in the world
 i'm not even saying what kind
 you don't even want to know about it
 and god help us if we ever have to use them
 but we have the most powerful weapons ever conceived by man
 they have the missile the super-duper hydro sonic i call it the super-duper it goes five times faster than a normal missile right
 we have one goes much faster than that
 but russia got that information from the obama administration
 russia stole that information
 you knew that
 russia got the information and they built it
 but we have now one that's much faster than that
 that's like a slow missile
 that's like considered a slow missile
 but i said it was incredible
 two weeks ago i said we have the finest the best the most incredible sadly the most deadly and we never want to use it but we have the greatest weapons ever in history by a factor of 10 by a factor of 10
 and they went crazy
 he's given away classified
 these people are sick
 all i'm doing is saying that we rebuilt our military 2
5 trillion all built in the usa every single ounce of it
 we have fighter jet f-35 that are so good you can't see it
 and i went to see the program and i met some of the pilots and these guys are better looking than tom cruise
 they're tougher
 they're stronger
 they're bigger
 they're more powerful
 they're smarter
 and i like tom cruise by the way because you can't get much better than top gun right
 great movie
 you can't get better
 i like tom cruise
 but these guys are better looking than tom
 they got that crew cut they got the crap under their eyes they got the whole deal
 they're smart as hell
 so i said so captain let me ask you how good is the f-35
 they're really good sir best plane we've ever had all great
 i said how do you compare that with what russia has
 well ours is better for a specific reason sir
 you can't see it
 what does that mean
 well when we fight they cannot see us that we are so stealth
 now that doesn't mean in three years that it won't be obsolete because that's what happens
 that's the problem with that business
 you come up with a new computer and two weeks later it's obsolete
 that's why i always like real estate and grab a piece of real estate
 but no it's true
 i wouldn't be good in that business
 you get to work work work and then you're starting the next one because the last one is gone
 that's why i always talk about walls and wheels
 when the democrats were saying walls are old fashioned
 well they're right about that
 but they work
 remember that
 all we had to go through in congress
 and that wall is going up think of that
 we're building 10 miles a week 10 miles a week of the top
 and our numbers on the border are the best they've ever been
 the best they've ever been
 well we're building 10 miles of wall a week
 we're up to about 330 miles and we'll have it finished very soon and it's having a tremendous impact on drugs
 it's having a tremendous impact on all of the different things
 human trafficking in women
 it's not even children
 they're trafficking women it's because of the internet
 you think of that as almost an ancient kind of a crime right
 but it's not
 it's a very modern crime and it's an unbelievably profitable crime
 they're trafficking women little bit children but mostly women
 where they'll put three or four women in the back in the trunk of a car and they'll go through the border
 they can't do it anymore
 and we're catching them
 we have people that do nothing but look for the traffickers
 to me the traffickers are the biggest scum of the world
 and thank heavens for ice and thank heavens for border patrol because these people do a job that you don't want
 i know mike doesn't want it
 you wouldn't even be good at it mike he'll do a commercial about it
 that's what he'll do
 does he have the longest commercials in history
 i say mike lindell
 i say mike the pillow man
 i say mike is the single greatest purchaser of commercials in history
 i want him to buy my commercials
 i say you know we spent 20 million i sell like two commercials
 he spends 2 and he's got the whole day on fox
 i said let mike buy our commercials
 will you
 i don't know what the hell you do but whatever it is you better tell me the secret
 greatest purchaser of commercials
 but we have done some job with that
 and the traffickers and drugs are way down
 now we got upset with the pandemic but i watched biden today talking about if only trump moved one week sooner
 one week
 so let's go ready
 so you know he was against the ban right
 because he didn't think we had a problem
 so he was against the ban
 he didn't know that china was heavily infected
 he doesn't even know where china is in my opinion
 but he was against the ban
 these guys write stuff out for him and he tries to read it
 doesn't do well with it
 so he was against it but now his new thing is if only i moved one week earlier but i was earlier than everybody
 if you think about it
 i had nice guy dr
 fauci i had another nice got a lot of doctors
 they were all telling me no no you don't have to do that
 tom knows that very well
 you don't have to do that sir
 you don't have to do that
 you don't have to do that at all
 and one of those things i was very early and i banned and everybody admits that had i not banned highly infected wuhan province right
 highly infected we would have had hundreds of thousands of more deaths
 and then you had the chart
 i put it up yesterday i'm doing these news conferences
 we're finally getting the word across that we did a great job but i'm doing news conferences now every day
 i call them the highly rated news conferences
 and i go before these crazy people they're screaming like maniacs
 it's not the way they treat sleepy joe
 he'd melt
 if they ever did a number on this guy would be there he'd be laying on the floor crying get me out of here darling
 where is my wife
 get me out of here please darling
 they're so nasty to me today
 what happened
 we go through it every single day
 but you think about it and he said if only trump moved faster but he's the one that two months later called me xenophobic and he called me a racist because i was banning china which was heavily infected
 and then he said don't ban europe
 well i looked at italy big problem
 i love italy
 i love the people of italy but they were heavily infected
 france i looked at france i looked at spain they even had spikes recently
 did you see
 and we're doing great
 we're rounding it with or without but we're going to have with but you know with his better but with or without we're rounding that corner and we're rounding it fast and they don't want to give us any credit because they want to keep this up 'til november 4th
 and on november 4th the press will probably say let's say something stupid happened
 the press will say i got to admit he did a damn good job
 and the other clown will be in office
 we did a thing called price transparency
 i signed it
 it's effective also very complicated
 it's on your medical
 and we did price transparency
 it's the biggest thing
 it's bigger than healthcare
 where you see your prices
 you can go now to hospitals you can price operations you can price everything
 it's a massive thing
 the man who did it… and i took a lot of heat and i'm doing favorite nations drugs meaning whatever the lowest in the world is we have to pay the same
 that's the good news
 the bad news is the drug companies the doctors everybody's angry at me
 actually under price transparency the good hospitals and the good doctors benefit tremendously but the bad ones don't and you have price transparency
 and it goes into effect on january 1st
 could you imagine if this sleepy guy gets in and they say like february march april something
 they say unbelievable what happened to prices it's dropping like crazy
 and they'll say what a job he's doing this president
 and i'm the one that signed it
 i said could you put it into effect but statutorily
 it has to mature mature mature
 so the earliest i could get is january 1st
 it's like crazy
 you know another one
 i'll give you another one
 i'll give you another one
 so air force one so that's the 757 but they have a 747 which is the big air force one
 i think that just disrespected the people of minnesota today they gave us the little one
 no actually it's because of the runway
 in fact when we landed they said sir we have a very short runway could you please hold on
 i said i trust these pilots
 by the way these pilots are the best pilots
 when you fly the president of the united states
 wait a minute he's waving from the window
 when you fly the president of the united states you are the best flyer
 they take the best air force guys they take the best marines in the helicopters marine one
 but when you're flying these planes you can land that sucker you have no problem
 there's no mishits
 there's no let's go around
 i can't quite make it sir
 these guys are phenomenal
 you've got to see what they look like
 everyone's in perfect shape
 i look at him central casting every one of them they're great
 thank you fellas
 thank you
 but i'll tell you a little story
 so air force one is a very old plane
 it's beautiful but it's an old 747 right
 it's 31 years old and other people didn't want to do it but it was time to get a new one
 it was time
 you got to get a new plane
 and actually air force one i'll give you a little secret it's actually two planes
 they get two
 it's a hell of a way to travel
 if one's not working perfect you use the other one
 but they get two
 so air force one they negotiated a price and they had it down for 5
7 billion that was not sounds expensive and it's ridiculous but that was done by the obama administration
 it was done by the obama administration
 and that's okay
 but no administration obama bush they didn't want to do it because it sounds luxury
 but at some point you got to buy a plane for the country
 and these arab countries would have their beautiful 747 800s 900s pour in and they were gorgeous
 and believe it or not the new plane is a much bigger plane
 much bigger wingspan it's a much more beautiful plane it's modern
 i think of a 31 years old air force one is 31 years old the main air force one not this
 this is a great plane but the big one 31 years old
 so you're representing the country but they didn't want to do it because it shows luxury for two planes in all fairness
 now it's very technical there's a lot of stuff
 i won't talk about it because i don't want to give away any classified information
 just trust me some more sophisticated sucker you've ever seen in your life
 i think you're getting into a plane that cost 5
7 billion
 right
 but it's the most sophisticated two planes
 so i said how much is it
 a general came and an air force general great guy handsome guy
 they're all so good looking these people
 i said so general what are we paying
 what's the price
  sir it's 5
7 million and we're ready to go sir could you sign it
 it sounds like a lot of money to me general 5
7 million for two airplanes
 can we get a better price
 no sir
 this was negotiated by the obama administration
 the obama administration
 this was negotiated sir by barack hussein obama
 and i said oh that's good
 it sounds very high
 so here's what i'm going to do
 tell boeing we're not taking the plane
 we have no interest in it's too much
 this is what i did
 by the way this is one of many stories
 isn't this better than going and saying i saved your iron range
 and i say but please remember i did this too
 and i can do away with this stuff but i did this too
 please remember that because i have all this list of incredible things i've done for minnesota i won't even touch it because frankly i'm tired of repeating what i've done for all these different states
 i mean i did all this stuff and then i hear i'm nine down
 i don't believe it by the way suppression
 so i said to the general i said general 5
7 billion not million billion
 that sounds very high to me general
 i bought a lot of planes in my life and a lot of helicopters
 i know a lot about it
 how could it be five
 sir that's the best price they could get
 we only have one day to do it
 i said cancel it general
 cancel the order
 it was signed actually
 yes sir
 i said do you have the right to cancel it
 yes sir
 i do
 we negotiated a great deal
 i said oh good
 cancel it
 yes sir
 i'm pleased to tell you something sir
 we have a breakup fee
 we made a great deal sir
 i said you did
 oh you have a breakup fee
 you mean you can't just cancel it for nothing
 then cancel it
 you don't have to pay a breakup fee
 i know about breakup fees
 no sir we have a breakup fee
 okay
 how much is it
 sir we can break it up for 250 million
 i said wait a minute
 so you mean to tell me that to cancel the order costs 250 million
 in other words we give them 250 million we get nothing
 i said general don't cancel the order
 just tell him i'm very unhappy
 this is what these guys
 they're good businessmen by the way
 these guys right here mike they might be better than you
 i don't even know
 he may be the next governor
 mike landell maybe you should run
 you should run
 he is my complete and total investment
 you should run
 he'd be a hell of a governor
 at least you know one thing
 minnesota would be well promoted
 mike run for governor please
 so he says it's 250 million
 it's 250 sir i'm so proud of that
 i said you may be proud but i'm not
 so i said general don't give them notice because i don't want to write a check for 250 and getting nothing
 i don't think i could explain that to the american public
 so tell them you're really unhappy we're not going to make the deal but just do it verbally
 and yes sir
 and then i spoke to the head of boeing a very nice guy
 they had some rough times since then
 they had a couple of really bad things happen
 terrible really terrible
 this was early on before the problems that they had
 but he is he's a high quality guy
 and i said to him dennis we have to start it with a… it's got to have a three on the front of it
 what do i know
 i just know that if they're 5
7 and if i do something with a three
 he said no i can bring it down to 5
5 billion
 so i say well that's not bad
 i save 200 million in about a minute and a half phone call
 so so far i'm not good but it's not good enough
 i'm not happy
 i said no we got to really think about canceling it
 and i can't go to airbus which is made in europe
 it's a little hard i got to go to their competitor
 i can't say i'm going to buy the air force one from a european company that doesn't work too well
 my only option was to say look i just don't want to just put it aside
 he calls me up a few days later
 well we can do a little bit better than that
 i said dennis has to have a three in front of it dennis
 got to have a three
 like a three three anything but got to have a three in front of it
 so he said no no no
 after one month we signed a contract for 3
9 billion
 same exact one
 actually slightly better we got an extra generator
 and then boeing came to me and i love to negotiate
 i do
 got that from my father
 my father was a good negotiator and i love to negotiate
 so they came to me sir we can put an extra stairway
 this is the big 747
 and remember this is a big much bigger than the old 747
 sir it gets very windy up there
 i noticed that your hair's blown all over the place
 but we can buy a stairwell for the plane
 and it comes under it's like a corkscrew right at the bottom of the plane
 you're very high off the ground big big thing
 and it opens up and if it's raining or windy you're covered sir because it's under the plane
 you're totally sheltered
 i said that sounds great
 so it's a corkscrew stairwell
 i said how much is that general
 50
 i said 50 what a deal so for 50000 i can get a stairway
 no sir
 50 million
 i said forget about the stairwell
 forget it
 he said 50
 i really thought he meant 50000
 so these are just some little stories
 i guess i must like minnesota to go on one of these deals
 but boy did you get your money's worth tonight
 is anybody having a bad time
 did you get your money's worth
 because you've heard the other one
 we've done this and we've cut your taxes and we built up the military bigger and better
 and we're the number one in history in regulation cuts which is the biggest thing
 and the judges which we've done at a level like nobody's ever done everything we've done
 nobody has done more in three and a half years no administration three and a half
 those first three and a half years nobody even comes close
 and you know it's a funny thing
 i say it all the time
 i've been saying it for a long time and the fake news nobody even questions me about it
 and you know if i was wrong they would but they can't question me because when you see right to try we took care of our vets
 we just got a 91 approval rating from the vets 91
 it's never happened before
 we got choice approved we got accountability approved drugs are way down
 we've got a little setback with this whole situation where these shutdowns cause a lot of problems with drugs a lot of everything but drugs were way down
 we had our best year in the history of our country last year
 and we're going to have a better year coming up
 that's why you have an obligation to vote for the guy that got you there
 and remember this and i really appreciate this thank you
 but i appreciate this because nine democrat mayors of cities in the iron range have endorsed me over sleepy joe
 what do you like better
 sleepy joe or slow joe
 what's better
 let's do a poll
 we do a poll
 we do a poll
 i do free falls
 you know these polls they charge you a fortune for this stuff
 they interviewed three people and then they charge you a million dollars
 we interviewed 233 people i got thousands of people at least for free
 what do you like better as nickname
 slow joe or sleepy joe
 so let's go
 wait slow joe first
 okay
 so just scream if you like it
 so you have a choice slow joe they're both very appropriate
 slow joe or sleepy joe ready
 slow joe
 i think we're going to have a winner here
 sleepy joe based steel real crap
 it wasn't that but when you think of it they wrote it out
 you didn't have environmentally the right
 somebody said oh well he got a bit because he was good with negotiating with these other countries
 it wasn't that
 i opened it up
 i signed an order
 i signed an executive order because obama took your iron range and biden took your iron range away
 and i'll never forget
 the day i did it and tom was there a man i don't know who he is he's probably in this massive audience but he came up to me and he was a rough guy and he never cried in his life including at childbirth
 he didn't cry at childbirth but he was crying
 and he said sir you gave our life back to us because obama took our heart out when he closed up the iron range
 he said you gave our heart back
 it's true
 so i just want to thank those cities
 when a democrat mayor and we have now a lot of… now we have additional
 so these are democrat politicians and two weeks ago they endorsed us and it's a great thing
 we're finding that all over the country
 democrats for trump
 politicians that got elected as democrats i don't think they changed their party affiliation but they endorsed trump
 they're all in the iron range area
 and larry cuffe is here
 larry cuffe
 where's larry
 where is he
 larry how are you
 why did you do that larry
 that's so nice
 i appreciate it
 boy are you good
 i wish you had a mic
 he said because you're the best candidate we could ever… i love this guy
 said you're the best candidate we could ever hope for
 thank you larry that's beautiful
 i appreciate it
 we'll do a good job
 we're not going to let you down
 and they're doing a good job over there
 so dig in dig in dig we must right
 it's all going because of me
 that's cool man
 thank you
 no he signed an executive order shutting it down
 just shutting it down
 and i hear it's got the best iron ore anywhere in the world
 that's what i hear
 the quality is the best
 … or anywhere in the world
 that's what i hear
 the quality is the best
 and it's like an unlimited amount
 i'm talking about a little this is a massive operation with thousands of people and everything else
 and for me it was very easy
 andrea zupancich where is she
 where's andrea
 thank you very much
 that's really nice
 i'm glad that at least you got a good location right
 that's great
 i appreciate it very much
 you're all friends i guess
 chris vreeland where's chris
 chris vreeland
 chris
 where's chris
 the mayor
 thank you chris
 thank you chris
 thank you very much
 kathy brandau
 kathy brandau
 thank you kathy
 i hope you're having a good time tonight
 we're not going to let you down
 you know that
 we're open
 that sucker is open
 we're not closing it
 well think of this though
 if biden gets in it's closed
 he said he's going to close it
 how about this guy
 no fracking
 you're not going to frack
 onstage with all these crazy people and they don't want any energy
 they think everything's going to run by wind which costs you a fortune about 20 times more than what we have and doesn't work
 but think of it all of these people… and they say what about fracking
 fracking is the modern technology
 and so they all said no no we're all against… everyone's against fracking
 what about you
 yes i'm against it too
 now he's against it for months
 he gets it now he's in favor of it
 but he's sort of grandfathering it
 you know it's a very weak… well i like to grandfather fracking
 if i'm a fracker i don't want to be grandfather
 i want to have it or not have it right
 he wants to grandfather fracking
 always go with their first statement okay
 so i was in texas two weeks ago we had crowds
 mike we had crowds that went from the airplane to the well to the drilling well where we went to see a well
 and we saved the industry because i got russia and saudi arabia to cut back 10 million barrels
 it actually was probably 18
 ended up being i think 18
5 million barrels
 and it saved the industry
 and yet you're still paying very low gasoline prices at the pump but we saved 10 million jobs
 but i'm in texas and let me tell you texas appreciated it because that industry was in deep trouble because all of a sudden with the pandemic there was no demand
 there was nobody driving there was no demand
 nobody ever saw anything like it
 so i'm in texas and i said to the crowd it was a great crowd and we must have had a hundred thousand people on the road on the highways and roadways waving
 and they had the most beautiful trump flags
 i wanted to stop where did you buy that flag
 the most beautiful flags of me and our great vice president
 is mike pence doing a good job by the way
 he did such a great… he worked 29 hours a day
 i mean this guy works day and night
 he worked not the 24
 he worked 24 plus least five okay
 this man is a worker and he's a wonderful human being
 and when they try it a guy like biden that can't carry his jockstrap
 when biden goes oh they should have closed one week earlier and here's the guy that said i made a mistake when i banned china that nothing's going to happen
 it's so phony
 this politics is a very phony business
 i haven't been doing it long
 i told one of the senators that came in he came into my office there  i've been doing this for 30 years
 i've won many elections i've only lost twice in my life
 i've been a senator for a long time
 i know what i'm doing sir
 i said yeah and i've done it for four years
 and i've only won one election but it's for the president of the united states
 i remember a certain man on television that didn't like me too much
 he said they put together the greatest field ever assembled the republicans remember
 17 plus me
 they put together the greatest field of talent ever assembled
 i hear trump wants to come in
 he's not going to do it number one
 number two if he does he's just doing it for fun and he'll be out by september and then he'll go about leading his life but he's not going to do it
 but we don't really need him because this is the greatest single assemblage of talent ever assembled for one party
 the greatest talent he's ever seen
 and then i did it and just week after week one out two out three out four out
 and then we've done changes
 oh he said he can't do it because he doesn't have any experience
 but i actually do on the other side
 i contributed to politics
 i always found it very interesting
 so in a certain way i had a lot of experience probably
 maybe i had too much experience
 that's why i can tell you about aoc
 check out the 2 million please check it out check it out
 check out omar check out omar get to that great writer he should get… oh so the new york times won all these pulitzer prizes right
 i was going to tell you before
 all these pulitzer prizes these people and they all got it wrong right
 they got for russia russia russia
 we give the pulitzer prize
 i won't use names
 i won't use names but we give the pulitzer prize to the new york times
 they got it wrong
 we give the pulitzer prize to the washington post and all of these real sleazebags
 i have to be honest with you
 very dishonest people very dishonest
 i call it the amazon washington post
 he uses that as his lobbyist because he owns the washington post
 he gets crap that other people wouldn't get okay
 that means it's a lobby
 it's a lobbyist deal
 but they got the prize right
 they got the pulitzer prize
 all the guys that got it right that really got it right they all got it wrong totally wrong
 and they should return the pulitzer prize
 and pulitzer association the committee should ask for those prizes back
 they got it all wrong
 they were a hundred percent wrong
 there was no collusion
 they couldn't believe
 remember the day when it was announced after three years there is no collusion
 i could have told them that a day one they could have saved 48 million dollars
 they got the pulitzer
 and then you take guys so many so many
 solomon sara carter bongino
 how about dan bongino
 so many so talented guys
 how about that great gentlemen who wrote the witch hunt
 remember that
 that was the first right
 you know what i'm talking about
 he's fantastic
 all great
 these people should have won the pulitzer prize
 now i would say sean hannity and lou dobbs and laura and tucker
 in all fairness tucker was very good
 tucker was great but these are all people that got it right
 now they don't do i guess the pulitzer prize for that stuff but they probably should
 but these guys all got it right
 and all they did was get a lot of money because they're very successful and that's okay i guess
 but they should give the pulitzer prize to the people that got it right and they should withdraw from all of those writers many of whom are back there right now all of those writers they should do that
 and a candidate for congress michelle fischbach who's supposed to be fantastic
 and michelle has my complete and total endorsement
 but jason you're in good shape wow
 you're in better shape than these congressman jase
 by the way jason is fantastic and he's doing a fantastic… where's michelle
 is she there
 be careful
 it's not worth the broken legs
 look at her
 oh she's a warrior i can tell
 come on up
 but thanks michelle
 and they have my complete endorsement
 they're great people
 they love your state
 they love our country
 so just in conclusion i want to say that over the next four years we will make america into the manufacturing superpower of the world
 and we will end our reliance on china once and for all
 we will make our medical supplies right here in the united states
 and you probably heard me today
 it used to be puerto rico did tremendous dollars in medical supplies
 and then what happened
 they made a lot they did a good job and obama biden destroyed it
 they took away the incentive all of the taxes
 and they took away the incentive and puerto rico went down a long way
 we'll get some of that back to puerto rico and we'll get it back for us
 take it away from china
 you heard that yes
 they took it away
 and then people automatically vote
 it's like a habit
 will i vote for the democrat
 the democrat was so bad to you
 and how bad were the democrats to israel
 we did jerusalem right
 we broke up the iran deal right
 and then they vote for a democrat
 it's out of habit but i think the habits we're breaking those habits very quickly
 but we've helped puerto rico and we've really helped… if you look at what we've done for israel it's been incredible
 they say nobody's done more
 and it's my honor
 but we'll hire more police increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities which are a disaster
 we'll appoint tough on crime prosecutors
 we will nominate judges and justices who interpret the constitution as written
 we will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race color religion and creed
 we will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life
 and that's why the supreme court is so important
 the next president will get one two three or four supreme court justices
 i had two
 many presidents have had none
 they've had none because they're there for a long time
 they tend to be appointed young
 they're there for a long time
 but the next one we'll have anywhere from one to four
 think of that
 that will totally change when you talk about life when you talk about second amendment when you talk about things that are so important to you
 you're going to be stuck for 40 years 35 years a long time
 so this is going to be the most important election in my opinion in the history of our country
 you got to get it right
 because if you don't get it right we will not have a country anymore
 you're not going to have a country
 not as we know it
 you won't have a country anymore
 we will uphold religious liberty free speech and the right to keep and bear arms
 we will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep america out of these ridiculous horrible endless foreign wars
 countries you've never heard of
 coming home
 we will maintain america's unrivaled military mind and we will ensure peace through strength
 this is what we have now
 peace through strength
 remember what i told you about those weapons we don't want to use ever we don't want to use those weapons
 we will end surprise medical billing require price transparency january 1st
 he doesn't even have to do anything now
 i'll be so angry if he… they'll say what a job he's done on transparency can you believe it
 and he won't even know what transparency is
 and it's complex
 and further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs
 we've done that already
 we will strongly protect medicare and social security and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions
 america will land the first woman on the moon and the united states will be the first nation to land an astronaut on mars
 and we brought nasa back
 nasa when i got in three and a half years ago grass was growing through the cracks of the runway
 it was over it was closed
 it was nothing
 now it's the number one space center in the entire world by a factor of five
 we will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools
 we will
 we will teach our children to love our country honor our history and always respect our great american flag
 and we will live by the timeless words of our national motto in god we trust
 you know that the democrat national convention and the pledge of allegiance at a caucus two of them not one
 i heard the first one i said oh they must've made a mistake
 they left under god out of the pledge of allegiance
 yeah yeah yeah
 now they then said oh well we didn't mean that
 they meant it
 that's what they're going to do
 they're going to take god out of it
 just like i was saying before texas they don't want god they don't want oil they don't want guns
 i don't think they're going to do too well in texas
 do you agree with that
 i don't think they're going to do too well in minnesota either
 no but could you imagine you're campaigning and it doesn't play too well here but could you imagine you're in texas and you have a guy say no oil no god no guns
 oh i think i'm going to vote for joe biden everybody
 and then they say texas is in play it's a very close… i have a friend in texas
 he said i think you're winning by 15 points
 these people are crazy
 texas is in play
 they don't want to let you have oil
 think of it
 it's unbelievable
 texas is in play
 that's the fake news back there
 they said it last time too
 remember
 texas when they say in play that means it's too close to call
 it's in play
 too close
 we've heard that for a long time in play right
 too close to call
 and they said it four years ago texas is in play
 this could be a terrible defeat losing texas
 big state great state
 this would be a tremendous defeat
 and they said it about ohio too
 i think we won by like nine points
 right
 they said ohio is in play
 utah's in play
 we won by a lot
 remember we beat a guy named mcmuffin
 remember the guy
 he was going to take the state of utah
 and then he was going to be able to negotiate
 but that didn't work out
 he came in third
 even hillary beat him
 but they said texas is in play
 and i'd go around telling my people damn it texas is in play how the hell
 every time i go there i have 35000 people at the stadium how could it possibly be in play
 they said it's in play
 my people would say i don't think so
 and we had a big texas rancher
 he was on one of the shows
 he was wearing a big beautiful hat
 i wish i could wear those hots
 it wouldn't work for me too well
 i don't think it works for me right
 but it worked for him
 and he said i don't know too much about a lot but i know one thing
 texas is not in play
 and this guy is going to win texas by a hell of a lot of votes
 and that's what happened that night the night of the election
 the night of the election they called the results
 i've been listening for six months texas is so close we can't even imagine it it's so close
 this is big
 and they only call the election immediately if you win in a landslide it's got to be tremendous
 and they said texas has closed its doors
 ladies and gentlemen donald trump has won the state of texas
 they didn't even say the polls were closed
 they forgot to say the polls were closed
 i wanted to say
 i said how come i won
 i called my people how could i have won
 it was so close they called it before they even said the doors closed
 and i heard from the governor of texas great guy greg abbott
 i said how are we doing compared to four years ago
 we did great four years ago big big win
 he said sir you're doing much better
 but these guys keep saying it's in play
 it's the same way that i'm down nine points in minnesota
 if i lose minnesota if i lose minnesota jason i'm going to blame jason if i lose
 boy we almost had it last time
 but we did the right thing
 we went to michigan we won michigan first time in many many years that michigan was won
 it's a great state
 for years you had a president who apologized for america
 and now you have a president who is standing up for america and standing up for minnesota
 so get your friends get your family get your neighbors get your coworkers and get out and vote
 and you know it's starting today in minnesota
 that's why i'm here
 it started today
 go out of here
 you know what
 if they're closed what the hell time is it now
 if they're closed just stand in line like you do
 people were here two days ago trying to get in here
 it's crazy
 so do the same thing at the voting booth please
 from st
 paul to st
 cloud from rochester to duluth and from minneapolis thank god we still have minneapolis to right here right here with all of you great people this state was pioneered by men and women who braved the wilderness and the winters to build a better life for themselves and for their families
 they were tough and they were strong
 you have good genes

 you have good genes
 a lot of it's about the genes isn't it
 don't you believe
 the resource theory you think was so different
