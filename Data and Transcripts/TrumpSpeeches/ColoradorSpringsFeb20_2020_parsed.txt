hello colorado
 we love colorado most beautiful place and i'm thrilled to be back in colorado springs
 i've spent a lot of time here over the years
 beautiful place beneath the majestic peaks that's true of the rocky mountains with thousands of terrific hardworking great american patriots
 with your help this november we are going to defeat the radical democrats and we are going to win colorado in a landslide
 and you're going to help us get cory gardner across that line because he's been with us 100
 there was no waiver
 he's been with us
 there was no waiver with corey
 we appreciate it
 thank you corey
 thank you
 this month we mark a very special anniversary
 75 years ago this week our brave united states marines landed on the shores of iwo jima and began one of the bloodiest battles of the second world war
 it was a rough one
 tonight it's our great privilege to be joined by three of the heroes of the battle of iwo jima james blaine donald whipple and john thurman
 great great patriots very brave people
 just passed away
 sadly he passed away just a few days ago
 he was going to be here
 passed away a few days ago but he was great
 i have a beautiful picture of him right outside and we're going to honor him and his family
 great great gentlemen
 so we were going to have four
 we have three and we want to thank you for being here
 thank you all
 thank you
 because america is truly a land of heroes on behalf of the grateful nation i would like to recognize the many veterans of the vietnam war and the iraq and afghanistan wars who are here this evening and a lot of them
 great people great people
 this is a truly incredible time for america
 we have the best economy in our history the most prosperity of any country
 we are doing better than any country in the world that is not even close
 and we've rebuilt our military over the last three years
 don't tell anybody but we spent two and a half trillion dollars
 but when it comes to our military and our safety and our security we don't worry about budgets right
 we don't worry about budgets
 we had to rebuild it
 it was depleted
 it was in bad shape
 it was old it was tired
 we have the best people in the world but they had old equipment
 now we have brand new jets
 we have brand new missiles and rockets
 we have everything all made in the usa
 in my state of the union address i proudly declared that we are in the midst of the great american comeback
 that's what we're doing
 our country is stronger today than ever before
 after three years of ridiculous witch hunts and scams and partisan democrat crusades the radical left's attempt to poison our democracy and overturn this last election have totally failed
 they have been a complete flop and we today have the highest poll numbers we've ever had today just came out
 and i don't know if anybody watched last night's debate it got very big ratings and you know what
 mini mike didn't do well last night
 i was going to send him a note saying it's not easy doing what i do is it
 it's not easy mike
 not easy for any of them
 now mike didn't do too well
 he went way down
 it's all right
 mini mike
 how about klobuchar did you see her
 she choked
 she choked
 she couldn't breathe
 alfred e
 neuman looked at her and said something slightly derogatory and she said are you accusing me of being dumb
 who would make a statement like that
 because that's really what he was doing but he doesn't want to say that
 no how about that
 are you saying i'm dumb
 that was the end of her campaign in my book
 you don't say that
 even if it's true you don't say that
 they had a crazy person on today on one of the fox shows
 i tell you fox doesn't treat us the way they used to
 but we have the great sean hannity we do and we have laura and tucker
 and we have in the morning fox and friends steve and ainsley and brian's gotten much better he's moving up
 and we have the great lou dobbs
 lou dobbs says he's the greatest president ever
 the great lou dobbs
 he says lou dobbs a year and a half two years ago he said he's the greatest since reagan
 then he said about six months ago he's better than reagan
 and then he said a few nights ago he's the greatest we've ever had
 i said does that include lincoln and george washington
 he said that includes them all
 that's lou dobbs
 the great lou dobbs
 and you've got hegseth and you've got jesse waters
 how about jesse
 and judge jeanine and even greg gutfeld
 greg hated us right
 but now he says look whether i like him or not he gets it done
 it's all about getting it done
 we're getting it done
 nobody's ever done what we've done
 no but fox says and i don't know it's different
 it was different
 in the old days it was better for us
 it was better for us
 but it's okay we'll win anyway
 no but they had this woman on
 neil cavuto doesn't treat us good
 neil cavuto he's not too good
 she said i don't like him
 nobody likes him
 right now… so you had remember lest in the readies
 you remember who was lest in the readies
 he got fired right
 you remember right
 remember
 he's gone and now neil's taking his place
 neil is actually a nice guy but he doesn't like trump too much
 and he put this woman on today and she said donald trump didn't do well in the debates and he won because she was referring to mike bloomberg sometimes referred to as mini mike
 and i said wait a minute i won every debate
 it's true
 and we sent them polls poll after poll after poll
 not only won them but won by a lot
 i won every debate
 i'm just saying every poll they do those polls right after three four 500000 people time magazine
 i said nobody's allowed to do that
 you can't do that
 we're at enough of a disadvantage with the fake news
 they make up 90 of the story
 so where is dan scavino
 where is scavino
 does anyone know who dan scavino is
 dan bring me those pages up here
 bring those pages up
 see if you can get them
 go get them
 it's such fake news
 it's so disgusting
 you know what
 they'd do better if they told the truth
 do you agree
 they'd do better
 oh someday in 10 14 18 22 years when i'm gone when we leave office in 26 years or so they're going to miss us
 i told the story that a month before i ran 2016 i was thinking about it
 i said to my wife who has become a great first lady
 people love here
 they said it's one of the greatest fields ever assembled
 and i said what the hell should i run for if they are so great
 but i remember holding up the new york times and it was like a leaflet that you give a certain a supermarket right
 it's like the thing was blowing in the wind
 it was dead and now it's successful again
 but when we leave it's all of us
 we leave together
 we're unified
 this is the most unified the republican party has ever been
 and when we leave the new york times… thank you
 the great dan scavino the most powerful man in politics
 hey dan
 so zuckerberg left
 who is number one in the world on facebook
 and i'm saying this in front of the fake news because if i'm wrong they're going to report me right
 who is number one in the world on facebook
 he walked in but that's us
 he walked in for… we had dinner recently just because i want them to pay taxes
 i want to find out what's going on
 but he walked in he's smart and he said i just want to congratulate you
 small dinner a few people
 he said you're number one in the world in facebook
 i said that's nice
 i said who's number two
 he said prime minister modi of india
 i said wait a minute wait a minute
 he's got 1
5 billion people and we have 350 so he should be number one
 but we're never going to give up that position of number one in the world for our country for facebook for twitter for anything and they still haven't figured it out
 they have not figured it out
 but look at all that press
 look at all that press
 did this ever happen before
 and then you have brad pitt
 i was never a big fan of his
 he got upset
 a little wise guy statement
 a little wise guy
 he's a little wise guy
 anyway but we're doing what
 over here i just showed this real quick
 right
 so this horrible journalist she's a real she's a trump hater
 you know what she's worth
 zero ratings
 nobody watches her but she said… she was trying to… look bloomberg made a fool out of himself last night
 he choked
 he's another one who's going  oh i can't breathe
 i can't breathe
 don't ask me the question please
 i look at my wife i said let's send him a little note
 it's not so easy up there to do what i did right
 not so easy
 but this woman who is a third rate fourth rate she's been with everybody
 every year she's with a different group but i won't use her name because it'll make her too famous
 it actually plays to their advantage
 but she's third rate and she's on the lowest rated show at fox neil cavuto
 that's why
 so she said donald trump didn't get good ratings
 he didn't do well in the polls
 she said he didn't do well on the debates
 she said that we were defeated in the debates
 well i defeated crooked hillary every time and by a lot
 yeah she's crooked as a 3 bill
 i was going whatever happened to the 33000 emails
 whatever happened
 33000 she deleted them and her acid washed them and she didn't get in trouble
 can you imagine if a republican did that
 they would want to bring back the death penalty right
 two standards
 but i think things are happening
 i said drain the swamp i just never knew how deep it was
 we have more garbage in the swamp than you would ever believe
 and this is part of the swamp
 so what happens
 she said donald trump didn't do well in the debates
 now remember my answer rosie o'donnell right
 first question i've ever and we took down the house
 then the second brett barry asked me i had to raise the hand
 i'm the only one i guess that raised the hand
 right
 and the place went crazy because i was the only one telling the truth
 okay
 turns out i was the only one telling… and the people get it
 but she said i didn't do well on the bench
 i said really
 i won every single debate
 we had 15 to 14 debates then we had the presidential debates with crooked hillary against myself
 so here's one
 i don't want to… i'm a little guilty because these are all my friends right
 a lot of them are my friends now
 they weren't my friends then they were my mortal enemy
 it's hard to be friends when you're competing against somebody
 you're right about that
 so here's donald trump 67
 the next one was 13
 the next one was 5 4 3 2 2 2 1 1 and 0
 all right that's time magazine
 all right that's time
 they don't like me
 i don't like them either by the way
 although actually i do like the new owner
 this year i got beaten out by gretta
 you know gretta
 last year i got beaten out… i mean i've won it
 but when the world evolves around all of us we should be chosen
 there's nothing wrong with it right
 i mean we've won it but we should win it every single year let's face it
 and now they call it person of the year
 they don't go out man of the year
 and i know the women out there are saying isn't that nice
 but a lot of the women out there don't like it
 they don't like it
 we could have a woman of the year and a man of the year
 i like that
 okay here's drudge report
 drudge is starting to treat me good again
 he started to like me again
 i like him
 look trump and ted cruz i can say he came in second
 he was a great debater
 and marco came in third and a guy who i don't like much and they don't like him much in ohio either kasich
 kasich
 he was way down
 way down
 okay look who won
 trump
 here's another one
 look again a different one time magazine
 trump 33
 ben carson good man he was down
 marco jed ted
 carly fiorina a name i haven't heard in a long time
 what happened to carly
 and ran good poll
 here's the story
 look but way up
 way up
 look at this
 here's another one
 look at this
 trump 46
 i didn't make this up
 here's another one
 this is a different debate
 i don't know
 they're all different
 i won every one of them
 look trump i just took these at random 46
 second 5 3 5 3 9 5 11
 trump 46
 here's another one cnbc
 well the market's been up
 they've actually been not so bad and joe kiernan is a good guy
 he is a good guy
 some of the rest i don't care for it too much
 becky's like she plays it a little bit down in the middle right
 which is okay
 trump almost 50
 then they have all the rest of them
 14 4 3 2 2
8 2
54 1
9 i'm not going to give you the names
 i won't tell you that i got 48
8 and jeb bush got 1
1
 the rest i'm not going to talk about but he hasn't been exactly a great supporter sort of a never trumper i guess
 so jeb 1
9 1
1 and trump 48
 that's another one
 oh here's a nice one
 here's a nice one
 look at this
 look at this
 trump 70 next one is 18 next one is 7 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 1
 trump didn't do well in the debate
 see they're fake news
 here's another one trump kicked ass
 trump kicked ass
 trump 48 number two was six
 here's another one
 trump 75
6 crooked hillary was 24
 this was against crooked hillary
 so look at that
 trump was 74
6 crooked hillary clinton was 24
1
 trump was 80 crooked hillary was 18
 and i've got this woman
 you know who it is right
 nobody knows the name
 i'm not going to mention it
 but everybody knows neil cavuto
 she has no credibility and neither do you neil cavuto
 here's another one
 crooked hillary and by the way one is a fox poll one is breitbart one is a drudge report
 one is a patch one is syracuse
com one is pollack opinion alyssa goodwin
 but look at these numbers
 trump 92
 what is it
 so i'm winning every poll i beat crooked hillary
 here's the one trump 61 crooked hillary 39
 okay
 that's what it is
 and then i turn on the damn show on fox
 again it's not the same
 it was much better
 it really was
 it was much better
 i turn on fox and i've got this third rate political journalist if you call her that saying trump did very poorly in the debates but he became president
 no i did great in the debates
 i became president because of the debates because unlike mini mike i could answer questions
 and here's the final one and i could get you another 15
 these are all the ones that taken right after
 people call in hundreds of thousands of people they call in time magazine cnbc
 so here's a cnbc crooked hillary clinton 39
 donald trump 61
 and then this stupid person said i didn't debate well
 now look i don't mind and you can have bad debates but i won every single debate
 listened to this then three and a half four years later i have to listen to a person saying how we didn't do well because these people are among the most dishonest people anywhere in the world
 take it
 take it
 here it is
 okay let's get back to business
 now i feel good
 now i feel good
 she's a third rate journalist
 let's go
 we're standing up in defense of our constitution our freedom and democracy itself right
 while the extreme left has been wasting america's time and doing all sorts of vial hoaxes we went through hoaxes
 we went through the impeachment scam
 and by the way corey was with us all the way
 he didn't move
 he didn't budge
 he said it's a lot of bull
 he said it's a lot of bull
 but while they're doing that stuff and we're working with a cloud we're working with these people
 they want to take you out
 they want to change the results
 they got caught spying let's say it like it is right
 they got caught spying on our election
 fake news
 hey fake news take your cameras for a change and show them the room and show them behind you
 go ahead show them the room
 show them the room
 you see they never do it including fox by the way
 fox is not that much better
 we just got lucky because we have some… all their high rated shows are the shows that like trump all their losers shows like cavuto are the shows that don't like trump
 how is shep smith doing lately by the way
 how is shep smith
 he had the lowest ratings and now cavuto took his place so that's okay
 but they never show the room
 my wife a great first lady she goes… i say hi honey
 did you watch the debate
 yeah
 how did the room look
 was that… because last night i think we turned away 21000 people
 we had an arena that it held 12 but we fill up the basketball courts right
 or the ice rink
 we had to have 15 16000 people
 it was on fire
 you all saw it
 it was great
 and she said to me she said darling how did you do
 i said i did great
 i said did you see the arena
 and she said no they never show the arena
 you know that guy dana white at ufc
 i won't tell you about him yet but he's a brilliant guy right
 i mean he sold his crazy fighters i mean bomb bomb bomb
 4 billion he got with fertittas great people
 but you know what
 they're always showing it's full
 it's full
 these fakers back there they don't want people
 but i'll tell you what my wife said they don't show it but you can't imitate 15000 people when it comes to the noise
 look they won't show it
 they never show it and we've never had an empty seat from the day i came down the escalator not one
 what these guys do if mr
 and mrs
 jones sitting right up there beautiful couple
 if she said darling i'm sorry there's nothing i can do about it darling
 i have to go to the bathroom
 he said darling i'll walk with you
 the cameras glong on to those seats they glong on and they say there were two empty seats
 trump didn't fill up the room
 these are the worst people
 but when i told them to spin around those cameras they stayed that way
 now if we had a protestor somewhere in the arena it could be up in that corner where it's loaded up with people those cameras that can do they look like a pretzel
 they look like a pretzel
 they want to find it
 there's trouble those same guys could it could cover anything
 i used to think well it's the equipment it's very rigid
 they can't turn it
 and then some idiot from up in the corner starts screaming stupid stuff because that's dangerous in this room to be honest
 we don't have it too much
 they only pick on the guys that are all by themselves and aren't fighters
 but if somebody up there does something those cameras turn around spin around like a pretzel
 they bend boom they get
 so that was the end of my theory that we have rigid equipment
 and by the way i told them turn around not one of those cameras turned around to show the room because it's fake news
 while the extreme left has been wasting america's time with vial hoaxes we've been killing terrorists creating jobs raising wages enacting fair trade deals securing our border and lifting up citizens of every race color religion and creed right
 we added another 225000 brand new beautiful jobs last month way way way above what our great geniuses back there thought it would be 225000
 think of it we right now have more people working in our country than at any time in the history of our country almost 160 billion
 00 in the morning they are watching
 the whole world was watching
 that was the most exciting television that anybody's ever seen
 even espn some guy on espn said this is the most exciting event i've ever seen
 and all he does is watch sporting events and big ones
 but since the election 7 million brand new beautiful jobs have been added and we've invested more than 2 trillion into that military that we talked about
 and we created- into that military that we talked about and we created something that's very exciting
 and we have our great new general
 he's on the … he's on our … i'll tell you he was on a list of the most incredible men you've ever seen
 the sixth branch of the united states armed forces the space force
 and i will be making a big decision for the space force as to where it's going to be located and i know you want it
 we'll be making that decision toward the end of the year
 i was here i did your … i met … i was up at the air force academy and i greeted those kids they were so great
 i did the commencement address
 was anybody there
 i did the commencement address
 and the general said sir would you like to shake hands with the cadets
 i said does everyone else do it president
 oh yes sir
 what he didn't say is they'll shake 10 hands
 i said so they do … how many do you have
 sir we have 1156 cadets
 i said you mean other people do it
 yes sir
 but they don't do 1156
 they'll do 30 40
 they'll take the top 10 out of the class
 i said i'll do it
 i stood there for two and a half hours and the sun was blazing
 true
 and i shook 1156 hands
 and a lot of these kids are very strong physically
 in fact you have one of them as an example he was the winner of the home run derby
 did you know that
 college … think of that
 the college home run derby
 i said let me see you
 i want to see what you look like
 he stands up uniform everything else
 and by the way i did something for air force but i did something for all of the academies
 if you were a great athlete and they had a hard time recruiting although they've done well if you're a great athlete you can't … we wanted to get them to go but they didn't because they didn't want to serve five years in the military and then they'd go into the nfl or baseball
 so i had one of the teams in
 they said sir give us the waiver sir
 they've been after the waiver
 you know what the waiver is
 that means that if you're a great athlete you can go to the air force academy or army navy the coast guard you can go to one of our service academies
 i did the rule and we got it through congress
 and you don't have to serve
 you go directly into the major leagues and to the nfl and you serve your time after when you get out
 isn't that great
 and the army coach who's a great guy … all great guys
 navy coach army coach said sir if you do that we can compete with anybody because we lost lot of great athletes who said you know we just can't do that
 now they serve their time afterwards
 isn't that great
 and we did it
 they've been trying to get that for so many years
 but i love that group of people
 i saw this guy from the home run derby and i shook hands
 oh i shook hands
 and they come up and they're strong people
 and they're shaking and they're excited
 they're a little nervous maybe
 they're meeting the president
 they're a little nervous and they're strong
 they've got big strong hands and they're saying … and i'm saying hello
 sir thank you
 man
 jeez
 what are you
 i'm captain of my wrestling team sir
 i admire you greatly sir thank you sir
 it's like … and i'm trying to act like it doesn't hurt
 by the end of the day i'm going like … but we did it
 and then i said wait a minute
 i said general no other president could do that
 the presidents don't do that
 he said no they do sir but they stop usually at around 50
 oh that's great
 but i love the air force academy
 and you have all of the infrastructure so you're being very strongly considered for the space command
 very strongly
 and actually i have to say this
 i think i can say this mr
 senator but the governor showed up at the plane today your governor
 democrat
 no but in all fairness he showed up because he wanted to lobby to see if they could get it
 that's okay that's all right
 and we are going to be making that decision cory when we make that decision all right
 okay
 but we've destroyed the isis territorial caliphate 100 percent
 we killed the founded and leader of isis al-baghdadi
 he's dead
 he's dead
 and we just killed the world's number one terrorist qasen soleimani ending his evil reign of terror forever
 forever and ever
 he was the king of the roadside bomb right
 when you see these young men and in some cases women no legs no arms
 they get it and 92 percent of them were from soleimani and then they started making them … they had great detection
 we had these guys great detection then all of a sudden the detection wasn't working because they started making them out of plastic instead of metal
 so they're blowing the guys up with the scopes so they had the scopes on and that happened recently because they started making it out of plastic
 real scum but he's gone he's evil he's dead and america is respected again like never before
 but as we keep on winning washington democrats keep on losing their minds
 they've gone nuts
 that's why millions of registered democrats voters people that were with the democrats for a long time they're leaving their party to join our movement
 they're joining our great republican party
 we have more enthusiasm than any party has had in the last 50 years
 and don't believe stories and don't believe polls because the polls are worse than the stories
 they give phony polls
 00
 the polls have closed … and you know they only announce if you're very … if you're really going to win by a lot
 otherwise it takes all night
 the polls have closed in the great state of texas
 donald trump has won the great state of texas
 thank you
 but they had alfred e
 newman buttigieg little buttigieg
 i said i've had you up to here
 they had little buttigieg leading donald trump in texas
 these people
 but very close
 they said it's too close to call where buttigieg … so a friend of mine from texas a big powerful strong guy real texas he's got the cowboy hat … i'd love to wear that hat i wouldn't have to comb my hair so much
 i wouldn't need hairspray right
 i love those texas hats
 i don't know if we'd get away with it in washington that's my only problem but i love them
 this guy wears that big hat the biggest hat
 he's a big guy
 and he's interviewed by somebody
 he said listen i don't know much about politics but i can tell you one thing
 buttigieg is not tied with the president
 the president is leading him by 20 points
 it's like i said the last time nobody's leading trump in texas
 and you know what
 nobody is even close to us in the great state of colorado
 we're leading big
 nobody
 with your energy and enthusiasm this november and specifically it's november 3rd is the big day and this is going to be as big … and i can't say bigger because what was bigger than that
 they came from the hills they came from the mountains they came out of the rivers they came all over the place
 great people they just never saw anybody they wanted to vote for
 women would come in they hadn't voted in 20 years great women beautiful women strong women smart women wives
 no no incredible
 and they love our country and they work hard and they pay their taxes and they work and they're … we're the elite just so you … they're not the elite we're the elite
 and you know what
 they'd show up they've got trump bandanas along with our great vice president mike pence trump pence and they got the hats now and they walk … these are people that were never political people
 they never wore a pin
 now they've got 30 pins all over their chest they've got the hats with the things and the trump and nobody's ever seen anything like it
 really it's a great revolution and we're turning this country around
 and i'm not saying anything can ever compete with 2016 but i think if we don't do it a lot of what we've done and we're going to go over the jobs and the regulation cuts and what we've done for the vets with choice and accountability but you know what
 they can undo it but in four years they can't undo it because that tree will be planted
 it will be solid
 they're not going to be able to do it so we've got to win
 and your second amendment is at stake remember that
 so this november we're going to take back the house we're going to hold the senate and we are going to keep the white house
 so we're thrilled tonight to be joined by many great leaders from across this incredible state and from all over the country and i want to thank mike pence

 they didn't want … they said it's too dangerous
 nobody would take it
 i'm the only who said take it
 we'll take it
 and it was unbelievable
 i went and i said this is great
 let's do it again
 and he has been my friend for a long time
 and they put together a phenomenal deal it's called ufc
 he's the ufc president
 and they just sold the company
 he started it off for about  30 and they just sold it for 4 billion
 and the people that bought it said we're not buying it unless dana white stays back and runs it
 so dana white come on up
 he's now a very wealthy guy
 come here
 you want to hear from him
 yes
 what's up colorado
 how are you today
 so i'm not a very political person i'll start there but let me say this
 there's things that i can tell you about the president of the united states that you don't hear on t
v
 and you don't hear from other people
 like you said i've known this man for 20 years
 we've actually become even closer since he's become the president of the united states
 when somebody becomes the president of the united states you don't ever expect to hear from them again and i understand it
 it absolutely makes sense
 this guy is so loyal and such a good friend every time i see him … i saw him today
 when i met him on air force one the first thing he said to me is how is your family
 how is your family
 good man very loyal and a very good friend
 i see a lot of things from mr
 trump that the public doesn't see and the people who surround me every day see how this man treats me as a friend and other people he's friends with
 he's a fighter he loves this country he's doing great things for this country and we got to win this election again ladies and gentlemen
 thank you
 that was beautiful because we get tired of hearing from these politicians all the time
 right politicians
 what a job he does and we thank you very much dana and you are my great friend and thank you
 but with cory and with me they're not going to play with your second amendment
 not going to happen but it's … it is under siege
 you see what's happening
 but somebody … we fight together and he's been so great
 cory gardner please come on up please
 thank you
 that's beautiful
 that's true of the pipeline
 a long time they've been trying
 we got it right away and we'll be announcing something very big toward the end of the year
 cory is a champion for the people of colorado
 he loves your state
 look he loves your state
 he was here he does the tractor thing
 he loves tractors he sells a certain type
 and don't worry if there's any noise just let them … they won't hear us
 and he's got my complete and total support and endorsement
 he will never let you down
 the unemployment rate among african-americans hispanic-americans and asian-americans has reached the lowest levels ever recorded
 and for women 71 years and soon you're going to be hitting the historic number
 71 years the best numbers in 71 years
 african-american and hispanic-american poverty has plummeted to the lowest rates ever recorded
 the unemployment rate for women is going … and i'm telling you within a very short period of time you're going to see some statistics coming out on … statistics
 i've got to do it right otherwise they'll say what's wrong
 if you go 16 of these and if you mispronounce one word they say what's wrong
 statistics for women that are going to be unbelievable
 they're going to be unbelievable
 the best ever
 the veterans' unemployment rate dropped to a record low
 workers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment ever recorded in u
s
 history
 half a million more hispanic-americans now own a home
 we've lifted 10 million people off of welfare and median household income is now at the highest level in the history of our country
 think of that
 think of this
 to lift up forgotten communities that need investment the most we created with tim scott great guy great senator from south carolina opportunity zones
 jobs and investment are now pouring in to over 125 newly-designated opportunity zones right here in colorado
 you know about that right
 it's been amazing
 opportunity zones are amazing what's happened
 we're supporting working families by fighting for paid family leave and getting it reducing the cost of child care and giving 40 million american families an average of 2200 in their pockets directly thanks to the republican child tax credit
 people don't know that
 our historic regulatory reduction campaign is ending the tyranny of washington bureaucrats
 we repealed the ridiculous waters of the united states rule which was basically taking away your property
 and we are taking the bureau of land management out of washington dc
 we're just on it and thank you very much secretary bernhardt
 just up here nice slim beautiful looking man
 he looks beautiful
 when you work with him he's beautiful because he gets it done and you're moving it and it's headquarters to grand junction colorado because we believe that the people who manage the lands of the great american west should live right here in the great american west
 and we have ended the war on american energy
 it was a war and we're up here and we're doing it
 we are right now energy independent can you believe it
 they want to use wind wind wind
 blow wind please
 please blow
 please keep the birds away from those windmills please
 tell those beautiful bald eagles oh a bald eagle
 you know if you shoot a bald eagle they put you in jail for a long time but the windmills knock them out like crazy
 it's true
 and i think they have a rule after a certain number are killed you have to close down the windmill until the following year
 do you believe this
 do you believe this
 and they're all made in china and in germany
 siemans
 and for those of you that want to hear it when they're making them more stuff goes up into the air and up into the ozone the atmosphere
 more stuff is going up there they're making it ay ay ay
 and they don't say this but after a period of time they get tired they get old they get rusty and a lot of the guys say hey their useful life is gone
 let's get the hell out of here and they're all over the place
 you look at palm springs california
 take a look
 palm springs they're all over the place
 they're closed they're rotting they look like hell
 every major democrat running for president wants to entirely eliminate american production of oil and natural gas crushing colorado's economy destroying tens of thousands of colorado energy jobs and demolishing property values all across the state
 they're doing that
 look you're going to vote for one of these people probably crazy bernie
 he seems to be leading
 mini mike i thought he might come up but he can't because he can't debate
 he wasn't meant for the camera do we agree
 he wasn't exactly great last night
 no i think he lost too last night
 only in colorado could somebody say that
 no you're going to probably … it looks like bernie doesn't it
 it looks like crazy bernie
 crazy bernie's not big into natural gas and oil and the things that keep our great factories and plants going
 but colorado voters will never let it happen
 we're reversing decades of calamitous trade policies
 america lost one in four manufacturing jobs following the twin disasters of nafta and china's entrance into the wto
 but under this administration all of that is changing
 the era of economic surrender is over thank you
 it's over
 last month we ended the nafta catastrophe and i signed the brand new u
s-mexico-canada agreement into law
 incredible deal
 the usmca is a gigantic victory for farmers ranchers and manufacturers all across the great state of colorado and every other state
 also something we got that people don't talk about if you love your children you don't have to pay estate taxes on your beautiful small farms and businesses
 if you love your children it's great and if you don't love your children don't worry about it
 who in the hell knows
 if you don't love them don't leave that beautiful farm to your children
 give it to somebody else okay
 if they don't treat you well give don't leave them a damn thing
 are you listening donnie
 are you listening donnie
 i also took … no it is true
 that's a big deal
 farmers were leaving their ranch and their farms and their … people were leaving their small businesses to their family and they were being assessed in valued much higher in many cases than it was worth
 you couldn't do it
 they'd go out … your kids would go out and borrow a lot of money
 they'd end up losing their business losing your farm that was in your family for 150 years
 you know what happens
 and they're good kids and maybe they'll never be you
 they can't farm like you and maybe they can't any maybe they can maybe they're better
 but you know what
 they'd go out and they'd borrow a lot of money and they'd lose the farm
 the numbers are staggering
 we got rid of it
 no more death tax no more inheritance tax
 and i also took the strongest ever action to confront china's massive theft of american jobs
 what they've done to us over the years we were losing 200 billion 300 400 500 not million billion
 billion
 not million
 500 million would be a lot
 we're talking about 500 billion they were taking it
 our strategy worked
 we put tariffs up 25 percent on the first 250 billion
 billions of dollars poured into the united states
 they devalued their currency and they pumped money in
 we didn't pay for it despite the fact that these guys … they like to say they did we didn't pay for it and i'll tell you what
 china- they like to say they did
 we didn't pay for it
 i'll tell you what china came to the table and we made a deal that's great for us and hopefully it's great for them
 last month as you know we signed a groundbreaking trade agreement with china that will defend our workers protect our intellectual property and boost american exports 250 billion worth of purchases 50 billion worth of farm agricultural purchase 50 billion
 you know the most they ever purchased were 16 billion
 you know that story
 i've told it a couple of times
 16 billion was the most ever
 secretary sonny purdue agriculture he's done a great job
 i said who's the most
 what's the biggest year
 16 billion sir
 i said all right make it 20
 so they agreed on 20 so now we're getting ready to close the deal biggest trade deal ever made biggest deal ever made
 we're getting ready to close the deal between that and usmca
 we're getting ready to close it
 i go over i say what do you have down for the farmers
 they've been great although i have been helping you out
 i gave you a lot of money
 i gave you a lot of money
 16 billion on year 12 billion from the year before
 i took it out of the tariffs or we had a lot leftover but think of it
 but i said so tell me fellas let me ask you what do we have
 what's the number
  20 billion sir
 they're going to purchase 20 billion worth of farm products
 i said make it 50
 tell them to make it 50
 so we went to china and they were great
 you know they got 1
5 billion people
 you got a lot of feeding to do
 i said do me a favor instead of 20 billion purchased from our farmers would you make it 50
 no no no no no and they agreed to do it
 they agreed to it
 i don't think you're going to be able to make it
 you better be able to make it
 i don't want the farmers coming to me sir sir i'm sorry we can't produce that much sir
 i said our farmers will find a way
 they'll go out and buy larger tractors and they'll buy some extra land
 go out and buy a bigger tractor or something
 no but it is true
 i've had people say sir they can't produce that much
 i said forget it
 they will
 look at them
 you're a farmer
 they'll figure that one out
 although mike bloomberg said you'll never figure it out
 they'll figure it out long before him
 you'll figure that one out long before him
 no i know the farmers
 i'm not worried about it
 50 billion on no issue have washington democrats more thoroughly sold out the american people than on immigration
 every day democrats open border policies are harming and killing innocent lives
 this region alone last year ice officers arrested over 2000 and by the way our ice officers these guys are tough and they're brave
 over 2000 criminal aliens that's ms-13 gangs thousands and they bring them back to where they came from
 by the way now their countries take them back
 they weren't taking them back safe third agreements
 they take them back
 charged or convicted of dangerous offenses including robbery rape and murder
 we bring them back and in some cases we don't even want to bring them back
 we have to put them
 i don't want to house them for the next 50 years but you know what
 we don't want to take chances either but we'll bring them back to guatemala honduras el salvador mexico
 we bring them back
 they didn't use to take them
 they said we don't want them back
 oh okay we'll keep them ourselves
 we don't do that anymore
 in denver an illegal alien was recently charged with brutally stabbing a judge multiple times attempting to murder him his own home
 the alien had been arrested 36 times over the past 20 years
 other than that he was a very fine fellow for crimes including assault and child abuse yet somehow they kept letting him go and he was still in our country
 in communities across the nation radical and we're watching them very closely left wing politicians are imposing deadly sanctuary cities and sanctuary states and policies that compel local law enforcement to release these illegal aliens straight into your beautiful communities
 last year colorado democrats enacted a law declaring this entire state to be a sanctuary for dangerous criminals
 as a result of state and local sanctuary policies officials in boulder defied federal law enforcement and released a previously deported child molester into the community
 in denver officials released a criminal alien arrested on felony drug charges and now he is a very dangerous man
 we just caught him for attempted murder
 right here in colorado springs el paso county officials defied the requests of federal law enforcement and released a criminal alien arrested for robbery assault and kidnapping
 they released him straight into your community
 these are the democrats
 these are your democrats
 democrats think that colorado should be a haven for murderers predators kidnappers and felons in our country and that come in illegally
 republicans believe that colorado should be a sanctuary for law abiding americans not criminal aliens
 if you want to shut down sanctuary cities and stop sanctuary states if you want to protect your family and your loved ones you must vote for cory vote for trump vote for the republican party
 we're getting it done
 thank you
 thank you very much
 thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border we've reduced illegal border crossings for eight straight months in a row
 illegal crossings are down 75 since last spring and we have ended the horrible practice of catch and release
 you know what you do
 you catch him
 you say where do you live
 they don't live here
 they don't have an address
 where do you live
 give us your address
 they don't have an address
 many are criminals
 many are very dangerous criminals
 so they're saying and we are building the wall
 it's gone up 122 miles as of yesterday
 it's a serious wall
 did you hear
 two weeks ago a small section twice the size of this stage we were putting it up and they're pouring the concrete and a lot of it's mexico it's very rough territory some of it
 it's partially desert
 we were in a rough area very windy and we had a tremendous sand and wind storm
 so we hadn't put it in
 we put it in and it was just getting set and we got hit with a tornado of wind and it blew it down and the fake news said trump's wall fell down
 it was blown down
 but see at least we have a voice where we can explain
 it's true
 we lifted it up and we held it up
 when the storm went by we had it set and it's set beautifully and the following day that sucker is going to be up for many many years
 can you imagine
 i said what happened in a certain area and we're doing a great job by the way in new mexico
 new mexico is going to be a great great state for the republican party and arizona what we're doing on the border in arizona they want us to do it badly
 but can you imagine that
 a thing falls over because the concrete was just poured it's soaking wet and it falls over and they make it sound like the wall fell down
 these are very very dishonest people but you know that
 border patrol has seized the largest amount of deadly narcotics over the last year ever recorded
 it's horrible what's happening the largest amount ever recorded
 we've deported record numbers of gang members especially the ms-13 gang members but there are others that are just as bad
 we've done more to secure the border than any administration in the history of our country
 the border is going to be very soon secured
 we'll have some time next year over 500 miles of beautiful powerful wall built
 washington democrats have never been more extreme taking cues from crazy bernie sanders 132 congressional democrats have signed up for bernie's healthcare takeover that would strip 180 million americans of their great private coverage that you want
 while the socialist democrats are trying to destroy american healthcare and trying to destroy your social security that won't happen with me my administration is protecting your social security your medicare and is fighting to give you great great healthcare already done a good job
 we're defending your right to keep the doctor and to keep the plan of your choice
 remember president obama 28 times he said keep your doctor
 keep your plan
 keep your doctor
 keep your plan
 keep your doctor
 keep your plan
 right
 it was a lie
 we should impeach him
 we should impeach him
 impeach obama
 get him out of office
 no nobody thought of that
 we caught him in a lie 28 times at least
 he's on record
 we caught him in a lie but nobody said let's impeach him
 only these maniacs crazy nancy pelosi crying chuck schumer
 what about the little pencil neck right
 pencil neck
 he's got the world's smallest neck
 here's a guy that lied about my statement
 he made up a statement and he delivered it before a contract
 he made up a statement
 it was totally fiction
 he made it up and then they tell me you're getting ready to sue him and they say oh no he's protected because he made the statement in the halls of congress
 that should be worse
 no that should worse
 little wise guy
 we're making healthcare better and much cheaper while premiums more than doubled in the five years before i took office
 we're now offering plans that are up to 60 less expensive and they're better
 they're better
 we're protecting people with pre-existing conditions and we always will
 we're fighting to stop surprise medical billing
 i signed an executive order imposing price transparency
 that's going to be bigger than healthcare in a certain way
 watch the prices come down because when providers are required to show their prices those same prices fall very very fast
 we have approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs which are just as good as the name brand drugs but at a tiny fraction of the cost
 we have totally transform veteran's health care including getting the long sought va choice and va accountability
 so now if our veterans have to wait in line they go out to a doctor a local doctor we pay the bill and they're all set
 they don't have to wait for six weeks
 he's agreeing right
 good
 right
 you don't see those stories
 you used to see all these horrible vet stores veterans the veterans on television and you don't see it because veterans choice it's amazing
 our great veterans here's a man right here
 you're saying yes
 purple heart
 thank you
 thank you
 that's great
 but it's a lot different under trump isn't it
 a lot different under trump and now you go out to a private doctor but you know we also got accountability
 they've been trying to get these things done for 45 46 48 years couldn't get them done
 i'm good at getting things approved
 i have to say
 but we also got accountability where we can fire people that aren't taking care of our vets
 if somebody isn't doing a good job you couldn't fire him
 now you look at him you say get the hell out of here
 you're fired
 we passed another thing
 for 44 years they've been trying to get it passed the spectacular right to try where we can use our medicines that are in trial if somebody is terminally ill or very sick we can use it and we are having tremendous results right to try
 i hope that nobody in this room needs it
 i hope you don't need it but if you do we have the best in the world and we're seeing amazing results
 we're combating the opioid epidemic
 drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 31 years
 we are pursuing new advances in neonatal research to care for america's youngest patients and breaking all records in so doing
 all of the radical democrats in the presidential debates have declared their unlimited support for extreme late term abortion ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up until the very moment of birth
 you know that
 that is why at my state of the union i asked congress to prohibit late term abortion for babies because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from god
 the democrat party is the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion socialism blatant corruption and the total obliteration of your second amendment
 that's what it is
 the republican party is the party of the american worker the american family the american dream and the late great abraham lincoln
 people forget that
 people forget honest abe
 he's the most presidential guy
 i've always said i could be more presidential than anybody but i'm not sure i can beat honest abe when he wears the hat
 that hat is too much
 it's so easy to be presidential so easy
 it's so much easier than doing what i have to do but you know what i'd have
 i'd have about three people in the front row
 how about sleepy joe
 how about his performance
 what
 what
 it's great to be with the great people of ohio
 joe joe you're in iowa
 you're an iowa
 oh wow
 he did it five times
 so far i've never done it
 thank you
 i've never done it
 if i do it that's a bad sign
 now he does it all the time
 he was in new hampshire and he said he was in vermont
 it's great to be in vermont
 joe you're in new hampshire
 dammit
 he'd go up and tell him again and again
 joe what the hell is wrong with you joe
 sleepy joe
 he's sleepy joe
 he was sleepy a long time ago but now he's really sleeping
 but it's easy to be presidential
 you know that
 the easiest thing you could do is presidential
 never open your jacket
 never
 it's got to be buttoned up
 right
 ladies and gentleman the president of the united states
 thank you
 thank you
 thank you
 thank you very much
 it's so great to be with the people of colorado

 they said it was one of the best
 smart smart
 smart guy
 we do good
 we're representing you
 i better do good
 if i didn't do good you'd dump me so fast
 actually i don't think you would dump be so fast actually
 you want to know the thing
 she said we're never dumping you
 fake news cnn went up to a woman
 what does it take for you to leave the president
 i'm not leaving him
 there were 10 women and the one woman beautiful incredible women and they had their bandanas they had hats trump and stupid cnn they go up what does it take for you
 then he goes look he said one time that his people are so good they'd stay with him if he shot somebody in the middle of fifth avenue
 do you remember
 right
  would you stay if he shot somebody
 this is actually an answer or something to the effect would you say every shot somebody in the middle of fifth avenue
 the woman looks well it depends why he shot him
 makes sense
 depends why he shot him
 but then they said we're not leaving him
 we're never leaving him
 we're in thing together folks
 we got the swamp
 we got that dirty rotten swamp
 we got crooked politicians
 we got a lot of bad people but we're getting them out one by one
 we better be little adam schiff that little adam schiff
 what a crooked politician
 he's a corrupt politician
 talking about guys he'll lie and then the next day get caught
 he'll be sorry that he got caught
 the next day he'll walk up to the mic and say exactly the same thing
 he's got no shame
 he's got no shame
 he's a liar
 i think he's a sick person
 republicans are fighting for the citizens from every background every community and every walk of life
 you know that we're the party of boundless optimism excitement energy and enthusiasm
 we are asking all americans to join our incredible movement
 we are the big tent
 we are the big party
 we have the big ideas for the future
 republicans are fighting for school choice big deal it's a big deal because no parents should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school
 to uphold the new rule of law we have confirmed 217 brand new beautiful federal judges who will interpret the constitution as written
 that's a record
 that is a record that it includes 192 judges who are appointed for a lifetime
 so think of it
 if they're 40 years old if they're 45 years old they can be there for 40 50 years
 as you know and by the way that's a record by a lot
 i have the record but there's one record that probably nobody will get the percentage record
 who has the percentage
 do you know
 george washington 100
 but it was only 16 people
 so with 217 can you imagine that
 it's a record and we're going up
 we're going up
 the democrats are thrilled about that one and as you know i have nominated and we have confirmed two great new supreme court justices colorado zone right
 colorado
 that's right
 colorado zone neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh
 neil gorsuch that's right
 colorado
 he's a great guy too great guy
 colorado
 that's a big thing
 that's another great check you have down for count
 neil gorsuch
 i recognized israel's true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem
 they said they were going to do it for years
 we recognize israeli sovereignty over the golan heights
 our investments in the united states military include more than 300 million this year
 has anyone ever heard of a place called fort carson
 another place peterson air force base you know that
 another place the air force academy you know that and schriever right air force base schriever
 schriever
 was that right
 schriever right
 schriever that's a little tricky one
 it took me a little while
 i'm looking at that sucker
 i'm saying schriever right
 thank you
 that's very nice
 he saw he was having a little trouble with that one
 that's tricky
 you don't like to mispronounce a word
 you come to a great place like this and instead of calling it fort carson you go at fort crasson and they say oh this guy doesn't know anything about us
 no a lot of money going into fort carson
 it's great
 for years you watched as your politicians apologize for america
 you saw that
 well i'd like to apologize
 we don't apologize
 now you have a president who is standing up for america and we are standing up for the great people of colorado
 at stake in our present battle is the survival of our nation
 if you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of americans have fought and died for they wanted to secure these great rights that we all have then we must devote everything we have toward victory in november of 2020 november 3rd
 only this way can we save the america we love and drain the washington swamp once and for all
 we'll get it finished
 we'll get it finished
 they're bad people
 they're all over the place
 they're bad people
 with your help we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity
 you know that
 together we will elect a republican congress to create a fair safe sane and lawful system of immigration
 we will continue to enact great new trade deals like we've been doing
 i'm going to india next week and we're talking trade
 they've been hitting us very hard for many many years but i really like prime minister modi
 we got to talk a little
 we've got to talk a little business
 they've been hitting us hard
 they give us tariffs
 one of the highest in the world is india
 but i hear they're going to have 10 million people they say anywhere from six to 10 million people are going to be showing up along the route to one of the largest stadiums in the world the largest cricket stadium in the world which is brand new and beautiful
 but you know what and the only problem with doing that prime minister modi said we will have 10 million people greet you
 here's my problem
 we have a packed house
 we have a lot of people thousands of people that couldn't get in
 it's going to look like peanuts from now on
 i'll never be satisfied with the crowd
 if we have 10 million people in india how can i be satisfied if we fill up a 60000 seat stadium
 big deal
 see i'm getting spoiled
 he said build a bigger stadium
 that's good
 colorado very good
 but it's going to result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase made in the usa
 that beautiful phrase
 we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine finding new cures for childhood cancer
 they've made such progress and ending the aids epidemic in america
 we started a year ago
 it should have been started long before in the last administration because they had the technology then
 they didn't start it but we're starting it
 we'll have it done within nine years
 it's a 10 year process
 think of that
 aids
 we will land the first woman on the moon and become the first station in the world to plant our flag on mars
 you have a lot of that action happening right here
 we will defend privacy free speech religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms
 that's a big one
 above all we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one beautiful america
 we support protect and defend the constitution of the united states
 we stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement
 we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life
 we believe that faith and family not government bureaucracy are the true american way
 we believe that children should be taught to love our country honor our history and to always respect our great american flag
 we live by the words of our national motto in god we trust from pueblo to fort collins from denver to durango from black forest to broomfield from castle rock to right here in colorado springs we stand on the shoulders of red blooded american patriots who poured out their heart and sweat and soul to secure our liberty and defend our freedom
 colorado was founded by pioneers and prospectors cowboys and miners and ranchers who tamed the wilderness explored the west scaled the rockies fought the battles and helped make this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth and we are making it greater every single day greater than ever before
 proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country
 we are returning power to you the american people
 with your help your devotion and your drive we are going to keep on working we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning winning winning
