 i've never seen anything like it
 you are warriors thank you
 we had some very bad people outside
 we had some very bad people outside they were doing bad things
 but i really do i appreciate it
 we have just a tremendous group of people in oklahoma
 and i hear i hear from your two great senators and your governor that we're doing very well in oklahoma that's the word
 that's the word
 i stand before you today to declare the silent majority is stronger than ever before
 five months from now we're going to defeat sleepy joe biden
 boy does he get a pass from these people huh
 we're going to stop the radical left
 we're going to build a future of safety and opportunity for americans of every race color religion and creed
 republicans are the party of liberty equality and justice for all
 we are the party of abraham lincoln and we are the party of law and order
 think of what we've done
 we will have close to 300 federal judges appointed and approved by the end of my first time that's an all time record
 that's an all time record
 i've always heard how important judges are
 now we know how important they are
 think of that over 300 around 300 by the end of the term
 and when we have another four years we're going to have a big big percentage of the total number
 very important november 3rd
 and two great supreme court judges
 so we have two justices of the supreme court justice gorsuch justice kavanaugh they're great
 they are they're great
 we have two
 and we could get a few more yeah we can get a few more
 we've spent over 2 trillion to completely rebuild the unmatched strength and power of the united states military
 and all of that incredible equipment whether it's submarines or missiles or rockets or jet fighters bombers it's all built in the usa
 we passed v
a
 choice
 thank you very much jim
 where's my senator
 jim inhofe you better vote for him he's running he's great
 but we'll get to him and james lankford in a second two great senators
 you have two great senators
 so we passed v
a
 choice
 so if you're a veteran for years and years they've wanted to do it for almost 50 years we got it done
 we get a lot of things done
 and so if you're a veteran and you have to wait on line for one week two weeks three weeks five weeks seven weeks two months
 what happens is you go outside you get a private doctor you get fixed up and they pay your bill
 we take care of the bill
 we take care of the bill and you get immediate service
 it's never happened before
 and our approval rating at the v
a
 is now 91 that's how good it is
 never been anywhere near that number
 never been anywhere near that number
 and v
a
 accountability we had a lot of bad people in the v
a
 people that didn't love our vets people that were sadistic people that stole a lot of bad people
 you couldn't get rid of them because they were let's say it could be unions it could be civil service right let's say let's just say
 and so you couldn't get it done
 that was another one for decades and decades they wanted to get it changed
 and i got it done with those people and your congressman your congressman who i'm going to introduce
 v
a
 accountability and now somebody treats our veterans badly and we look at them and what do we say
 we say you're fired get out right
 get out
 they got rid of a lot of bad people that were there for a long time
 sort of like me in washington draining the swamp
 i never knew it was so deep
 but it's happening
 it's happening i never knew it was so deep
 it's deep and thick and a lot of bad characters
 thank you
 we're lowering the price of prescription drugs making our allies pay their fair share
 they get a big bargain on drug prices and enacting fair trade deals
 that finally finally after all these years put america first
 i've been saying it for a long time
 we passed the largest tax cuts in the history of our country
 the democrats want to raise your taxes
 tell me about that
 tell me about that
 i guess i'm old fashioned
 all my life all my life i heard politicians want to lower taxes not raise them
 if you could lower him you couldn't lose
 the democrats want to substantially raise your taxes
 how do you figure that
 how do you figure that
 and regulation cuts we passed more regulation cuts than any administration in the history of our country
 and with the help of our great energy workers many of them come from the great state of oklahoma
 do you ever notice that biden no do you ever notice that biden oftentimes gets the state wrong
 he's in iowa and he says it's good to be in idaho
 no no you're in iowa
 he's in new hampshire and he says it's great to be in ohio
 no no no you're in new hampshire
 that happens to him all the time hasn't happened to me yet
 when that happens there's nothing you can do to make up for it
 you might as well just walk off the stage because the speech is a disaster
 right right
 but we just turned the united states into the dominant energy super power of the world of the world
 and because of the chinese virus what happened about three months ago it looked like we were in big trouble and we were and i got it back together
 i called russia
 right i called russia
 i called saudi arabia and believe it or not i called mexico
 mexico was a little bit tough
 that's called opec plus did you ever hear of opec plus
 that's opec plus plus
 and we got them to do the right thing and we have our energy back to almost 40 a barrel meaning you have an energy business again
 almost 40 a barrel
 couple of months ago it was zero and we were going to lose 10 million energy jobs 10 million jobs
 so texas and oklahoma and north dakota and many other states would have been hurt
 now you think you're going to be hurt there
 you try putting aoc in judge of your energy
 that will make the pandemic look like child's play to the people in energy
 she has one problem it's called petroleum
 no president or administration has done more in the first three and a half years than the trump administration
 not even close
 nobody
 how about the cnn anchor how about the cnn anchor you know did a little shave job in the head which is fine
 and he's standing in front of a building saying things are very peaceful here
 and the building is it looks like the biggest fire i've ever seen
 the whole town is burning
 it's like the biggest fire
 and he said things are very good here anderson
 i think it's great
 these are wonderful people anderson
 did you ever see that
 it looked like the world was coming to an end
 and we did something in minneapolis after watching for three or four days i called i said you got to get … you can't protect yourselves
 i got them to take 8000 national guardsmen
 and in one hour it all ended and they rode through the next three weeks with no problem
 and we did the same thing in other cities
 but how about seattle
 isn't that great
 so they take over a big chunk of a city called seattle
 i mean we're not talking about some little place we're talking about seattle
 have you ever been to seattle
 they took over a big chunk and the governor who's radical left all of these places i talk about are democrat you know that every one of them every one of them
 and i'd have an offer out i said anytime you want we'll come in we'll straighten it out in one hour or less
 now i may be wrong but it's probably better for us to just watch that disaster
 i flew in with some of our great congressmen who we're going to introduce it a second
 and i said to them congressmen what do you think
 i can straighten it out fast should we just go in
 no sir
 let it simmer for a little while
 let people see what radical left democrats will do to our country
 but americans have watched left wing radicals burn down buildings loot businesses destroy private property injure hundreds of dedicated police offices
 these police officers they get injured they don't complain
 they're incredible
 and injure thousands upon thousands of people only to hear the radical fake news say what a beautiful rally it was
 and they never talk about covid
 they don't talk about when you see 25000 people walking down fifth avenue or walking down a street of a democrat run city you never hear them saying they're not wearing their mask
 you don't hear their say as they're breaking windows and running in
 and then when i say the looters the anarchists the agitators they say what a terrible thing for our president to say what a terrible thing
 but you don't hear them talking about covid covid to be specific covid-19
 that name gets further and further away from china as opposed to calling it the chinese virus
 and despite the fact that we … i have done a phenomenal job with it i shut down the united states to very heavily infected but all people from china in late january which is months earlier than other people would have done it if they would have done it at all
 i saved hundreds of thousands of lives
 we don't ever get even a mention
 then i closed it down to europe early closed it down because i saw what was happening
 and by the way most people said don't do it don't do it
 we saved hundreds of thousands of lives and all we do is get hit on like we're terrible
 and what we've done with the ventilators and with the medical equipment
 and with testing you know testing is a double edged sword
 we've tested now 25 million people
 it's probably 20 million people more than anybody else
 germany's done a lot
 south korea has done a lot
 they called me they said the job you're doing … here's the bad part
 when you do testing to that extent you're going to find more people you're going to find more cases
 so i said to my people slow the testing down please
 they test and they test
 we had tests and people don't know what's going on
 we got tests we got another one over here
 the young man's 10-years-old
 he's got the sniffles
 he'll recover in about 15 minutes
 that's a case add him to it
 that's okay
 that's a case
 i was actually with a very nice man very good man even though he's very liberal the governor of new jersey right
 we know him
 now listen he said to me something that's amazing
 new jersey was very heavily hit very hard hit thousands of people
 he said with thousands of people that died thousands of people there was only one person that died under the age of 18
 would you believe that
 which tells me one thing that kids are much stronger than us
 when you see a little kid running around say boy oh boy do you have a great immune system
 how about a piece of your immune system
 they don't even know about this
 let's open the schools please
 open the schools
 open the schools
 we got to get them open
 in the fall we got to get them open
 the unhinged left wing mob is trying to vandalize our history desecrate our monuments our beautiful monuments
 tear down our statues and punish cancel and persecute anyone who does not conform to their demands for absolute and total control
 we're not conforming that's why we're here actually
 this cruel campaign of censorship and exclusion violates everything we hold dear as americans
 they want to demolish our heritage so they can impose their new oppressive regime in its place
 they want to defund and dissolve our police departments think of that
 00 o'clock in the morning and a very tough i've used the word on occasion hombre a very tough hombre is breaking into the window of a young woman whose husband is away as a traveling salesman or whatever he may do
 and you call 911 and they say i'm sorry this number's no longer working
 by the way you have many cases like that many many many
 whether it's a young woman an old woman a young man or an old man and you're sleeping
 so what are you going to do right
 so they want to defund
 they really do this as a serious movement
 and in minneapolis the council's already passed it
 in seattle you see what's going on there it's even worse okay
 these people are stone cold crazy
 they're crazy you want to say that beautiful heritage of ours we have a great heritage
 we're a great country
 you are so lucky i'm president that's all i can tell you
 people have come up to me say how do you take it
 i say do i have a choice
 do i have a choice
 we deal with a lot of bad people but we're winning
 and every once in a while i'll have one of these days where i'm hit left and right left and right like even this great event
 if you could have seen outside or if you could have heard the reports the reports oh it's covid
 it's this again
 by the way it's a disease without question has more names than any disease in history
 i can name kung flu
 i can name 19 different versions of names
 many call it a virus which it is
 many call it a flu what difference
 i think we have 19 or 20 versions of the name
 but they say to me where do you get the energy
 i say i don't have a choice
 i don't have a choice
 it was interesting to show you how fake they are you might've seen it
 so last week they called me and they say sir west point west point we're ready
 i said oh that's right
 i have to make the commencement speech at west point
 just to show you how bad the fake news is so they say to me sir we're ready to go
 i say let's go
 this is after saying hello to a lot of cadets inspecting little areas of a building that was very exciting
 actually it's beautiful very old
 studied a lot of our great generals some of our presidents that went there
 west point is beautiful right on the hudson river
 but after an hour the general that runs it is a fantastic guy
 after an hour we land we do some more inspections and they say sir are you ready
 yes i am
 so we walked like the equivalent of about three blocks which is fine
 we go onstage which is fine
 they make speeches then i make a speech that lasted a long time
 i don't know maybe 45 minutes maybe longer i don't know but a long time
 the sun is pouring down on me okay
 but they said to me before the speech sir would you like to salute each cadet each single cadet
 or maybe there'll be in groups of two
 would you like to salute
 like this
 yes
 like this almost 600 times
 you know what that is
 600 times
 thank god they were in twos because let me tell you you do that 600 times you go home and you say it's like a workout without a weight right
 600 times
 so i did that
 then the incredible helicopters brand new gorgeous helicopters the apaches and the other new ones that we just bought like that but i make this speech
 i salute for probably an hour and a half maybe more but around that
 watch
 if i'm off by two minutes they'll say he exaggerated
 it was only an hour and 25 minutes
 he exaggerated he lied he lied he's a liar
 these people are sick the fake news
 so then i finish saluting my final salute i said thank goodness
 thank you very much
 think of it
 so essentially almost 600 times
 now the general says sir are you ready
 i said i'm ready general where are we going now
 you have to understand i left early in the morning to get there
 now it's sort of late in the afternoon
 a lot of these fakers were with us
 so they know
 he said  sir we can now leave the stage
 i said great general let's go i'll follow you and he goes like this right here sir and i walked off
 the stage was higher than this one and the ramp was probably 10 yards long
 i say general
 now you got to understand i have the whole corps of cadets looking at me and i want them to love their president i did this big thing
 i love them i love them
 they're incredible and they do
 i said general i've got myself a problem general
 because i'm wearing leather bottom shoes which is good if you're walking on flat surfaces
 it's not good for ramps and if i fall down look at all those press back there look at them
 this was a steel ramp you all saw it because everybody saw it
 this was a steel ramp
 it had no handrail it was like an ice skating rink and i said general i have a problem and he didn't understand that at first
 i said there's no way
 he understood i just saluted almost 600 times
 i just made a big speech
 i sat for other speeches
 i'm being baked
 i'm being baked like a cake
 i said general there's no way i can make it down that ramp without falling on my ass general
 i have no railing
 it's true
 so i said is there like something else around
 sir the ramp is ready to go
 grab me sir grab me
 i didn't really want to grab him
 you know why
 because i said that will be a story too
 so now i have a choice
 i can stay up there for another couple of hours and wait till i'm rescued or i can go down this really steep really really really … it's an ice skating rink it's brutal
 so i said general get ready because i may grab you so fast
 because i can't fall with the fake news watching
 if i fall if i fall i remember when president ford fell out of the plane do you remember
 i remember when another president nice man threw up in japan and they did slow motion replays
 it's true right
 i don't want that general
 now he's standing there big strong guy and he's got these shoes but they're loaded with rubber on the bottom because i looked the first thing i did i looked at his shoes
 then i looked at mine
 very very slippery
 so i end up saying okay general let's go
 i will only grab you if i need you
 that's not a good story
 falling would be a disaster
 it turned out to be worse than anything i would have been better off if i fell and slid down the damn ramp
 right
 so what happens is i start the journey inch by inch right
 i was really bent over too
 i didn't like that
 i didn't like this picture
 this picture i'm sure will be an ad by the fakers
 so i was bent over right
 bent over like this
 then we finally reached almost the end and the fake news the most dishonest human beings they cut it off
 you know why
 because when i was 10 feet short i said general i'm sorry and i ran down the rest right
 i looked very handsome
 that was the only good
 i wouldn't want to run down the whole thing because the fall there would be definitely bad
 so i took these little steps i ran down the last 10 and by the way their tape take a look
 in almost every instance it ends just before i run and they said here was the number one trending story
 i call my wife i said how good was that speech
 i thought it was a … hey look i will tell you when i make good ones and bad ones
 like so far tonight i'm average but we're having fun we're having fun
 so far tonight but i call my wife and i said how good was it darling
 she said you're trending number one
 i said to our great first lady i said let me ask you a question
 was it that good of a speech that i'm trending number one
 because i felt it was really good
 no no they don't even mention the speech
 they mention the fact that you may have parkinson's disease
 it's true
 it's true
 it's true
 they say there is something wrong with our president
 i'll let you know if there's something wrong okay
 i'll let you know if there's something i'll tell you what there's something wrong with biden that i could tell you
 so then my wife said well it wasn't only the ramp
 did you have water
 i said yeah
 i was speaking for a long time
 i didn't want to drink it but i wanted to wet my lips a little bit
 you're drinking you're working hard up there with the sun pouring down on you
 i love this location the sun's like this
 this way they save on lighting right
 that's why they did it probably
 so what happens is i said what does it have to do with water
 they said you couldn't lift your hand up to your mouth with water
 i said i just saluted 600 times like this and this was before i saluted so what's the problem
 she said well i know what you did
 you had on a very good red tie that's sort of expensive
 it's silk because they look better
 they have a better sheen to them
 and i don't want to get water on the tie and i don't want to drink much so i lift it up the water
 it's so unfair
 it really is
 so unfair
 they are among the most dishonest people anywhere on earth
 they're bad people
 bad people
 okay that's enough of that
 i wanted to tell that story
 does everybody understand that story
 the left-wing anarchists tore down a statue of thomas jefferson
 now we're getting into the real stuff
 they decapitated a statue of christopher columbus except in new york when the italians surrounded it
 they didn't have too much of a chance
 those italians i love the italians
 they heard they were going to rip down their beautiful christopher columbus and all of a sudden they circle that thing
 they didn't do too well in hurting christopher did they
 thank you to our italian population we're very proud of you right
 two days ago leftist radicals in portland oregon ripped down a statue of george washington and wrapped it in an american flag and set the american flag on fire
 democrat all democrat
 everything i tell you is democrat and you know we ought to do something mr
 senators we have two great senators we ought to come up with legislation that if you burn the american flag you go to jail for one year
 one year
 jim and james
 jim and james
 we ought to do it
 you know they talk about freedom of speech and i'm a big believer in freedom of speech but that's desecration that's a terrible thing they do
 we used to have things we don't have them anymore because we want to be so open so everything and look what happens
 we should have legislation that if somebody wants to burn the american flag and stomp on it or just burn it they go to jail for one year okay
 in seattle the democrat mayor and the democrat city council have surrendered control of six city blocks to an anarchist … now these are anarchists these are not protestors
 you listen to the fake news they say oh the protesters were lovely
 could you imagine if people just even slightly to the right tried to take over seattle
 they'd have machine guns out to get them but these people can take over the city look at what they've done to businesspeople that have spent years and years building their business and now they're wiped out
 take it away
 governor inslee ought to get his act together get in there i'll help you i'll do whatever you want
 i'm waiting for a call i would love to do it
 i would love to do it it'll take less than an hour and it'll all be over with and you'll have your city back
 yet biden remains silent in his basement in the face of this brutal assault on our nation and the values of our nation
 joe biden has surrendered to his party and to the left-wing mob
 he has no control
 does anybody honestly think he controls these radial maniacs
 you know what he says to his wife when he's not confusing her with his sister
 get me the hell out of there
 these people are crazy
 that's what he says
 he has absolutely no control
 you know a lot of times i'll make like a speech and i'll have this beautiful paragraph come out criticizing every little aspect of the speech beautiful brilliant but joe didn't … it'll say a comment from joe biden but he didn't say it
 professional people great students in english lit people that are very smart say it
 joe biden said and they'll go into this highly complex paragraph beautifully worded and i say joe didn't say that
 joe doesn't even understand it
 wait a minute air force one is 31 years old
 people don't realize that
 so i said they gave me a charge very early in my administration like how about the first week
 sir would you sign for this plane
 now it's actually two planes
 would you sign for this plane
 air force one
 i said how old is the original or the one we have now
 sir it's 31 32 years
 i'd see people coming in from foreign lands that can't compete with us rich countries but they can't compete with the … they have a brand new beautiful 747-800 and i say wait a minute
 that country has new and we have a 31-year so somebody had to do …
 this was the boeing before that and they were riding high like i was before this thing came in but we're still riding high because you know what
 on november 3 we're going to win
 we're going to win
 so they came in and they came in and they said no no no we want 5
6 billion whatever it was
 whatever it was if i'm a little bit off they'll go crazy
 whatever but it was a lot
 5
6 billion
 nope got to have a three
 got to have a three call me up
 nope cancel the contract
 i said cancel the contract
 i want it canceled
 i said general can you cancel the contract
 he said yes sir i'm very proud of it
 oh good
 cancel it
 okay sir
 by the way to cancel it do you have to pay anything
 yes sir
 we have a cancellation fee sir
 how much is it general
 250 million
 i said what
 sir we made a good deal
 250 million to kill
 you mean if we don't buy the plane we have to hand them 250 million
 that's not good right
 look at these two guys they're looking
 by the way that's like a good story compared to some i could tell you like with aircraft carriers
 so they said 250 million
 or i always say this or around that number because if i'm off by a little bit they say oh he exaggerates
 i look at numbers all day long
 that's what i look at for years now for my whole life when you think of it
 250 million cancellation fee sir
 he was very proud of himself
 what a great … i say general
 don't cancel
 don't cancel
 just tell them i don't want the planes
 don't put anything in writing don't put it in writing general
 why sir
 because i don't want to pay 250
 true
 you hear that jim
 jim inhofe he's great
 you hear that jim
 you know that story
 he does a great job
 so here's what happened the bottom line
 boeing says no way no way no way
 the next week they say no way we're doing it
 the next week they said how about 5 billion
 i said no way
 no way
 the next week they said 4
8
 i said nope
 it's got to have a 3 at the front of it
 don't you understand you dumb son of a bitch
 don't you understand
 i turned out to be right
 turned out to be right
 nobody gets that
 nope
 got to have a three
 next day they come back 4
5 is our best offer
 nope
 i'm not doing it
 i'm not doing it
 come back when you're ready
 a month goes by another month they never heard about it they never heard from me they thought i was serious i was and they came back at 4 billion
 that's a lot of money but i save like a billion six or a billion seven
 nobody wants to talk about it
 nobody wants to talk about it
 when i get foreign nations to pay us billions and billions of dollars nobody wants to talk about that
 when i take soldiers out of countries because they're not treating us properly germany is an example
 i mean i have a german heritage like some of you
 i said let's get it down from 50000
00 to 25000
00 because they're delinquent
 for many years they're delinquent
 they haven't been paying what they're supposed to be paying
 they're paying 1 instead of 2 and 2 is a very low number and they say yes we think by and they say yes we think by 2030 maybe 2032 we could get current
 i said no angela please
 don't say that angela
 it's true
 you know who i'm talking about
 by the way very nice woman
 very good negotiator
 i said angela that's a long time this was in 2019
 she said 2032
 i said no angela that's not working
 but i said because now they want to get cared but i said well what about the last 25 years
 all the money you owe us
 everybody forgot about that
 they forget about all the money that wasn't paid
 i said what about the trillion dollars that you really owe
 so we're negotiating let's see but in the meantime we're reducing our troops
 remember this we're supposed to protect germany from russia but germany is paying russia billions of dollars for energy coming from a brand new pipeline
 so they pay the country we're supposed to protect them from they pay billions of dollars to that country
 we're supposed to protect them
 excuse me how does that work
 and the great thing is with jim inhofe and with james lankford likewise they just said they love you james
 when they hear it they get it
 a lot of people don't get it
 they get it
 we cannot continue to be ripped off
 we're ripped off by so many countries and we're stopping it
 and that means that a lot of people don't want me here
 they don't want me
 there are a lot of people that don't want me
 they don't sell a lot of bombs when we're not dropping bombs on people
 you know that right
 it's called the military industrial complex
 when rioting and looting broke out in our nation's capitol i very quickly deployed the national guard
 i said get them in
 after watching for an evening or two we stopped the violence and restored peace and order to the streets
 and last night that had a little breakout
 again they ripped down a statue that was 110 years old beautiful piece of art in front of the police precinct with our radical left mayor watching on television
 we're not happy
 that's going to be very expensive for dc
 they're always looking for money
 we need more money
 we always need more money
 and then they don't do the proper job
 so it's not going to be good for mayor bowser mayor bowser there
 they were heading over to the jefferson memorial recently and they wanted to do damage to our great beautiful jefferson memorial
 not going to happen
 don't worry about it
 we have it surrounded with very strong people
 the choice in 220 is very simple
 do you want to bow before the left wing mob
 or do you want to stand up tall and proud as americans
 and explain this to the nfl
 i like the nfl
 i like roger goodell but i didn't like what he said a week ago
 i said where did that come from in the middle of the summer
 nobody's even asking
 we will never kneel to our national anthem or our great american flag
 we will stand proud and we will stand tall
 i thought we won that battle with the nfl
 the stadiums were emptying out
 did you see those stadiums
 it took them a long time to get you back
 a lot of people didn't like that
 a lot of people that you wouldn't even think would care that much
 i've had people that i said these are super left liberals and they didn't like it
 joe biden and the democrats want to prosecute americans for going to church but not for burning a church
 they believe you can riot vandalize and destroy but you cannot attend a peaceful pro-america rally
 they want to punish your thought but not their violent crimes
 they want to abolish bail abolish and open up your borders
 they want open borders let everyone and by the way we're doing so well
 we have a record this month on the borders
 nobody's coming in
 very few people
 and they want to abolish ice our great people from ice who send the roughest toughest meanest people that you've ever seen or ever heard
 generally speaking when they have lots of tattoos on their face they're not looking to do you much help
 ice they're rough guys
 they're great americans but they'll walk into they caught them in a pack
 they'll walk into a pack of tough ms-13 gang members
 and we shouldn't say this it's not nice
 they want us to negotiate
 they start swinging
 and the other such way everybody's swinging at the end they carry them back and they throw them into the paddy wagon
 they're great
 and these people want to get rid of ice
 they get rid of murderers
 they get rid of rapists
 they get rid of the worst scum on earth
 and when i called them animals i said they're animals
 and nancy pelosi they cut up a young woman
 they cut up a young woman and her friend cut them up with a knife because it was more painful
 dead
 cut them up with a knife because it's more painful
 it takes longer than shooting a gun
 they cut them up
 i said these are animals
 and nancy pelosi said these are human beings
 they're not animals
 if i lose an election over that you know what
 this country is in big trouble
 they want to disarm law abiding citizens and dismantle our police forces while freeing vicious ms-13 gang members
 in joe biden's america rioters looters and criminal aliens have more rights than law abiding citizens
 and that's true
 in my administration we defend american citizens and we deport ms-13 members or put them in jail if we have to
 the chaos you're seeing in our democratic run cities these are all run by the democrats is what will happen in every city and community and america and much much worse if we don't keep them out
 we have to do this
 we have to go to the polls on november 3rd and the rest of you know what to do
 you know what to do
 got to keep the white house
 joe biden's record can be summed up as four decades of betrayal calamity and failure
 he never did anything
 he was a senator
 he was a vice president
 he was before that something
 you know what's great
 president
 trump was tough on this or he was tough
 they complained never did anything about it
 he's been there for 43 years or 47 years
 he never did anything about it
 biden's supported every globalist attack on the american worker let's make every country of the world rich but ourselves including nafta the disaster of nafta
 he wanted to go and tpp would have ruined our automobile industry
 korea i renegotiated the deal
 i took a horrible deal
 that was a hillary clinton special
 that was a hillary clinton special
 she said we have to make this deal with south korea
 it's going to mean 250000 jobs
 and she was right for south korea 250000
 and china's entry into the world trade organization was supported by sleepy joe biden
 that was one of the worst deals economically in the history of our country
 when china joined the world trade organization they were flat line for decades
 they became like a rocket ship
 he voted for the war in iraq
 he voted for mass amnesty for illegal aliens
 he supports sanctuary cities and now biden wants to end immigration enforcement and he wants to require you to provide free healthcare for millions and millions of illegal aliens
 when i took early and decisive action to ban travel from china and protect americans from the virus
 and as i said joe biden opposed my decision and called it hysteria xenophobia
 he doesn't know what the word means xenophobia and fear-mongering
 and then he apologized a month later
 he said he was wrong but he didn't say it
 and they didn't cover it
 they didn't cover it
 on one of the single most important policy decisions of our lifetime joe biden sided with china over america that's closing the border
 he thought it was a terrible thing
 remember this was in january
 that's early real early the end of january
 he thought it was a terrible thing
 when we close the border
 too many people that were badly infected with covid
 when the chips are down biden will always cave to the radical left
 he'll always bow to the angry mob and he will never protect you or your family and you know that
 joe biden will always let you down
 that's been his history
 at my direction early this year the heroes of the u
s
 military took out the world's top terrorist the savage killer leader of isis al-baghdadi and the number one terrorist anywhere in the world qasem soleimani
 we took them out
 joe biden opposed killing soleimani
 he was vehemently… we killed this number one terrorist
 he didn't like it
 you know why he didn't like it
 because he thought it would be good politically that didn't work out too well
 just as he opposed the raid that killed osama bin laden
 he opposed it you know that
 biden is always on the wrong side of history as said by people that are with him and worked with him
 he never made a correct foreign policy decision
 biden is a puppet for china
 son walked out with 1
5 billion
 i think it's a little bit… allowing them to rip off america for many years
 now they're paying us billions and billions of dollars
 we give a lot of it to our farmers
 we have plenty leftover
 china is not exactly happy with me
 they pay us billions and billions of dollars
 and they targeted our great farmers
 and i took the money that they targeted i took that money and i gave it to the farmers
 so they were even so they're okay
 are you okay
 come doctor please
 doctor
 thank you
 these people some of the people are waiting for five days especially in this location
 you take your time darling take your time
 thank you very much
 take your time
 doctor thank you doctor
 some people wait for four or five days
 that's incredible
 he never did anything against china joe biden
 and that's why they desperately want him to win
 they want him to win so badly
 iran wants him to win so badly
 let me tell you i'm going to make a very fast deal
 the best deal you've ever seen
 i've already made one with china but i can make even more
 they want me to lose because they will own the united states if i lose
 iran
 president obama gave them 150 billion for nothing
 i told them
 and look what happened to biden in ukraine where his son's paid 83000 a month
 and he was jobless
 give me a break
 83000 a month
 more than anybody
 if joe biden were to become president an emboldened left will launch a full scale assault on american life
 you know that
 they'll expel anyone who disagrees with them
 look what happens when you disagree
 you use a term that's perfect and they're not happy with it
 they call you a racist
 they call you a horrible person
 they want to crush religious liberty
 they don't want religion
 silence religious believers indoctrinate your children with hateful and vicious lies about our country subsidize late term abortion and after birth execution
 they want to take away your guns through the repeal of your second amendment as sure as you're sitting there
 in fact he even put the big gun grabber beto o'rourke who made a fool out of himself when he ran for president
 they put him in charge of guns
 lots of luck on your second amendment
 just remember i said and hopefully you won't have to think back about it too much because it won't matter
 hopefully it won't matter
 no beto o'rourke who wants to give up guns is in charge of the second amendment
 the dems will also eliminate private health insurance ban fracking that's not good and american energy will be in a position of weakness like it's never been before
 and that's after we built the greatest energy country anywhere in the world by far
 and they want to appoint supreme court justices who will utterly obliterate your constitution
 and you now see how important the supreme court is
 think if we didn't have two justices that i think have been very very very good but think how important it is
 think how important it is
 and we still i guess it's a i don't know if it's an equal court it's almost like we're a minority court right
 it's almost like we're a minority court
 the recent supreme court cases prove that if joe biden is elected he will stack the court with extremists the forgotten men and women together with everyone else
 we'll lose everything
 the forgotten men and women i campaigned on the forgotten
 these are great people
 these are substantial people
 these are the elite
 by the way you're the elite
 they're not the elite
 you're the elite
 somebody two days ago said sir the elite are really working hard on trying to destroy you
 i said yeah why do you call them the elite i said why
 well they're not elite
 i look better than them
 much more handsome
 got better hair than they do
 i got nicer properties
 i got nicer houses
 i got nicer apartments
 i got nicer everything
 i ran for politics once just once in my life
 and i became president of the united states
 and hopefully if you get out and vote we'll do it one more time
 we won't even toy with them about three or four more times
 we won't
 we'll do it one more time
 we'll be two for two
 and our country will never ever be stronger
 but i'll be soon announcing a new list of exceptional candidates for the united states supreme court
 and i'll choose only from that list
 a hundred percent probably 25 incredible people any one of which could be a great justice any one of which
 and i did it last time and people loved when i did it
 and i'll only pick from that list
 biden can't release his list because the names would be too extreme too radical
 they wouldn't be acceptable but they will be very radical people
 people don't understand but we actually won on daca yesterday
 we actually won because they basically said you won but you have to come back and redo it
 it's almost like gee come on back your paperwork was no good
 but we're going to be refiling but don't let it get you
 everything's going to work out really good
 everything's going to work out good
 it was a great it was great
 i mean would have been nice if we won
 and everybody said oh you're going to win daca
 you're going to win daca
 that's easy
 you got to win daca
 that's easy
 they all said it
 and they came back and they said we don't like what you did with your paperwork essentially
 so we're re-filing it
 most people would say we lost
 we didn't lose
 we're going to refile it
 and everything is going to work out for the young people
 most of whom aren't so young anymore by the way
 but we're going to work it out for everybody
 biden is fully controlled by the fringe of his party
 he is their pawn
 he doesn't even know where the hell he is
 let's face it
 he installed socialist alexandria ocasio-cortez
 to be in charge of his environmental policy and his energy
 energy you can forget petroleum
 how does oklahoma feel about being petroleum free
 not good right
 our country will have no energy
 our country will have nothing
 oklahoma texas north dakota and many others will all be out of business
 i don't think that's going to work out too well but she's actually in charge of environmental policy
 and you know what that means
 she doesn't even want to win
 she doesn't want those bird killing machines that go round and round
 you want to see a lot of birds that are dead
 go under a windmill sometime
 she wants us to go back to the stone ages because she's got no sense no credentials
 she's got a little charisma not much but she doesn't have a clue
 you know it
 but she's in charge of the environment
 no airplanes
 we can forget boeing i guess come to think of it
 we talked about boeing
 we could forget boeing
 let's cancel those brand new air force ones
 likewise representative ilhan omar is going to be very much involved in a biden government
 they will put this hate filled america bashing socialist front and center in deciding the fate of your family and deciding the fate of your country
 i don't think she would like to make the government of our country just like the country from where she came somalia
 no government no safety no police no nothing
 just anarchy
 and now she's telling us how to run our country
 no thank you
 and i think we're going to have a big victory in the state of minnesota because they've had it
 they've had it
 biden is a very willing trojan horse for socialism
 when biden first ran for president over 33 years ago remember i used to call him 1 joe he never got more than 1 until obama took him off the trash heap
 but he blatantly copied the speech of a british politician even ripping off the man's personal biography and family history and claiming it was his own
 he forgot to say he was born in america
 joe biden is a shameless hypocrite
 since 2003 he has delivered fawning eulogies to the funeral
 and at those funerals of three leading supporters of segregation including a former member of the kkk and yet biden is now smearing as racist tens of millions of people like yourselves
 decent hardworking americans who he's never met
 and he frankly probably doesn't want to meet
 america should not take lectures on racial justice from joe biden
 sleepy joe
 a man who praised and partnered with segregationists shift millions of black american jobs overseas and everyone else's jobs too by the way
 if i didn't come along we're building auto plants we're building everything
 and there's never been a comeback like we're making right now
 never been
 he hollowed out our middle class including our black middle class with open borders
 trapped young children in failing government schools built cages
 those cages were built by obama and biden
 look it up 2014
 and the fake news doesn't wanted to… remember the picture of the cage
 a cage for children
 remember the picture of the cage
 and they said president trump
 and then they realized that was at a newspaper 2014 the same… built by obama and biden the cages
 and they don't- and they don't want to report the way it is
 they know the way it is
 they're not stupid
 they sent young boys to fight in iraq while the inner cities crumble helped the big banks while hammering community leaders and made our cities less safe and secure for all
 they've done a terrible job and they shouldn't be awarded
 they should not get rewarded with an election victory on november 3rd that shouldn't happen
 it'll destroy this country
 our country will be destroyed
 we've all worked too hard
 they don't know what the hell they're doing
 some do actually but in a very sinister way
 virtually every policy that has hurt black americans for half a century joe biden has supported or enacted
 i've done more for the black community in four years than joe biden has done in 47 years
 racial justice begins with joe biden's retirement from public life
 we are joined tonight by many outstanding republican leaders
 these are great people
 we have two of our most distinguished hardworking wonderful friends senators
 they do a great job
 senator jim inhofe and james lankford please stand up

 not every person is but this group is and we have a lot of them in washington and we'll send jim inhofe back and we'll send all of them
 you'll send every one of them
 they have to come back because they have been fighting for us and they've been fighting for you
 and they are just incredible talented tough strong people that love your state a lot
 so thank you very much
 so we built the greatest single economy in the world
 and then we say not only the world but actually in the history of the world and they never even challenged me
 so i guess i'm right
 we did it
 we had the best numbers anybody's ever had
 we have the best employment numbers african american hispanic american asian american the best employment numbers in history the best stock market numbers in history
 we were the envy of the world
 everybody would come in to see me presidents prime minister kings queens and dictators
 dictators would even come in to say congratulations on the economy
 and then the plague came in and now what we're doing is we're doing it again
 and it's going fast
 we have to have a lot of it done because people don't quite get it
 we're doing record business
 it's happening at a level and a speed that nobody can believe
 two weeks ago job numbers came in the single biggest number in the history of our country
 last week retail sales numbers came in retail sales the single greatest number in the history of our country
 so here's what's going to happen
 here's what's going to happen
 they blame a president for anything
 when you see looters even though we put them down if we didn't stop them nobody would because the other side will never stop them
 but they always blame a president
 here's what's happening
 we're going up
 we're going up
 we're going up
 we're going to go up
 then we're going to hit october
 we're going to be up
 we're going to be way up
 we're not going to be where we were but in many ways other than all of the horrible horrible death that was so needlessly caused by a virus that should have been stopped where it originated which was china
 but we're going to go up up up up august september october and people are going to say man this guy is doing a good job
 he knows what he's doing
 i don't believe the fake news anymore
 and you're not going to want to lose your 401k's
 and you're not going to want to lose all of that wealth that you've accumulated whether it's real estate wealth or any wealth you can think because it'll all come tumbling down if these people are put in charge
 and if they double and triple and quadruple your taxes it will be a whole different ball game
 so i'm not putting any pressure on anybody but in the end we're going to have a phenomenal economy
 and next year we're going to have a good third quarter but next year and i said it before will be the single greatest year economically that we've ever had okay
 and if you see that happening if you see it happening on november 3rd you don't have the guts to vote against trump
 you even you you don't have the guts to vote against trump
 say wait a minute darling
 my 401k is higher than it was the last time
 i don't think i want to take a chance
 you're not going to want to do that
 the stock market has been the best
 think of this go back one week and go back 50 days
 in that 50 day period it's the strongest 50 days in the history of the stock market think of it
 and your wife or your husband says darling i love you so much
 you are such a great investor
 and all you did is just keep the same crap you had the first time right
 darling i love you so much
 you've always been a loser
 you've always lost money
 but now under president trump you're one of the greatest financial minds in our country
 and all you did was keep your stock
 what's wrong with having these great economic numbers
 what's wrong with having to close it down
 we saved millions of lives
 you know a lot of people say we should have gone herd let's go herd
 ask them how are they doing in brazil
 he's a great friend of mine not good
 you heard about sweden right
 too much
 ask them how they do it in sweden
 we saved millions of lives and now it's time to open up get back to work okay
 get back to work
 i recently signed groundbreaking criminal justice reform
 i secured record and permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities
 we slashed regulations and passed massive tax cuts to give black workers a pay raise like they've never ever gotten before and lift up black owned businesses
 and i worked closely with a great senator also friend of theirs senator tim scott south carolina to create opportunity zones which are doing incredibly
 and since then countless jobs and 100 billion of new investment not government investment have poured into 9000 of our most distressed neighborhoods anywhere in the country
 9000 never happened before
 tim scott
 today
 i'm also announcing that i have directed secretary of the interior david bernhardt to place the john hope franklin reconciliation park here in tulsa on the african american civil rights network
 so many of my friends have been asking me to do that
 so many of my friends including these great politicians
 so we're going to do that
 it'll be done very quickly
 we will forever remember and honor the courageous people who helped build this state and this country
 democrats are stoking division in order to distract from their decades of failure on schools jobs housing justice and crime
 in major city public schools run by democrats over two thirds of students are falling behind in reading and math
 and i think the numbers are worse than that
 but democrats would rather deny these children the future they deserve than allow them to attend the charter public private religious or independent schools of their choice
 pro choice pro choice
 pro choice for schools
 it's very popular but some people it's like a disaster because what it does to certain unions that have a lot of power over the democrats even though they know it's wrong
 republicans believe access to education is a civil right
 it's a civil rights
 20 of 20 of the most dangerous cities in america are controlled by democrats
 think of that 20 of 20
 and so is nearly every major city with a child poverty rate that's over 30
 they're controlled by democrats
 we can name every one of them
 the murder rate in baltimore and detroit is higher than el salvador guatemala or even afghanistan
 how are they doing the democrats running those cities
 your whole country will be like that
 in 2018 alone our police arrested nearly 12000 people for murder and manslaughter 25000 people for rape and nearly 1
5 million for assault violent assault
 the democrats' push against our police will drive up crime and drive up costs at levels you'd never believe
 thousands of innocent lives will be lost
 as president i will always support the incredible men and women of law enforcement
 a vote for republicans is a vote for better schools better jobs safer families and stronger communities for all americans
 there is a limit to what we can together achieve with four more years
 with your help we will lift millions of our citizens from welfare to work dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity
 that's what's happening that's what's happening
 and that was happening at a level that nobody ever thought they'd see it was happening before this covid came in
 it was happening at a level that nobody believed possible
 and then china sent us the plague thank you very much
 we will protect medicare and social security for our great seniors
 and we'll always protect patients with pre-existing conditions
 always always
 we will appoint more judges to interpret the constitution as written
 we will end deadly sanctuary cities
 we will finish the wall which has now 212 miles built and beautiful
 212 mile
 that's a lot of miles
 and let me tell you you think that was an easy one that was a tough one
 that party was totally unified against building the wall
 you know in the end they gave up you know what happened
 they realized it was a bad issue for them because these open borders
 i love when they fight for open borders because anybody that wants an open border coming in from rough areas there's something wrong with those people
 so did you notice in the end it was like just leave us alone build your wall just leave us alone
 i said thank you very much
 and we will elect a republican congress to create a fair safe sane and lawful system of immigration that puts american workers first
 we will revitalize our cities and we will build gleaming new roads bridges tunnels and airports all across our land
 we will enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase made in the usa
 it's so beautiful so beautiful
 made in the usa
 that's happening too
 we have so many plants coming into michigan and so many other states
 we have car plants coming in would have never come if i wasn't president would have never come
 we will become the world's premier pharmacy drug store and medical manufacturer
 that's already started
 we're bringing it back
 we will keep america out of foolish stupid ridiculous foreign wars
 we will never hesitate to kill america's terrorist enemies
 when i took over isis was all over the place and i did something that i felt we should do
 and we have now obliterated we have now captured 100 of the isis caliphate
 100 100
 and like our depleted military when i took over like our empty shelves medically when i took over like all of the things that when i took over it was a mess we have done a job
 you had to see what isis was doing
 they were getting bigger bigger bigger bigger bigger
 i came in smaller smaller smaller
 sir we've just taken 100
 we will launch a new age of american ambition in space
 and the united states will be the first nation to land on mars good program
 you saw the beautiful rocket three weeks ago go up beautiful
 we will defend privacy free thought free speech religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms
 and when you see those lunatics all over the streets it's damn nice to have arms
 damn nice
 interesting how all of a sudden people understand it right
 you couldn't sell it
 now people understand it
 the right to keep and bear arms we'll protect your second amendment
 above all we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one america we will support protect and defend the constitution of the united states
 we uphold the principle of equal justice under the law
 we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life
 we believe that faith and family not government and bureaucracy are the true american way
 we believe that children should be taught to love our country honor our history and always salute our great american flag
 and we live by the words of our national motto it will never change in god we trust
 we stand on the shoulders of american heroes who crossed the oceans blazed the trails settled the continent tamed the wilderness dug out the panama canal laid down the railroads revolutionized industries
 won two world wars defeated fascism and communism and made america the single greatest nation in the history of the world
 and we are making it greater and greater every single day
 proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country
 we are returning the power to you the american people
 with your help your devotion and your drive we are going to keep on working we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning winning winning
 we are one movement one people one family and one glorious nation under god
 america will soon be thriving like never before because ladies and gentlemen of oklahoma the best is yet to come
 together we will make america wealthy again we will make america strong again we will make america proud again we will make america safe again and we will make america great again
