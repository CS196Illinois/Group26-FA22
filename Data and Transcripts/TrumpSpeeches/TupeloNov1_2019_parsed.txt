ell thank you very much
 and hello tupelo
 this is great to be with you tonight the great state of mississippi
 the great state of mississippi and by the way the birthplace of a gentleman not too many people heard of him elvis presley
 but to be with thousands of incredible patriots who put their faith in god family and country
 right
 four days from now this state will head to the polls and vote to continue our extraordinary progress with your next governor republican tate reeves
 great guy
 great guy
 under republican leadership jobs are booming confidence is soaring wages are rising crime is falling and our nation is stronger than ever before
 we're now an economic powerhouse
 we've never been in a position like it
 we've rebuilt our military and we have financial strength
 and by the way for those of you with a thing called 401ks the stock market hit today another all-time historic high
 unemployment in mississippi has reached the lowest rate ever recorded ever recorded
 that's not bad
 that's not bad when you're on the debate stage and you say we have the best economy we've ever had
 we have the best military we've ever had the best unemployment and employment numbers we've ever had
 said got the best president we've ever had
 thank you
 thank you
 thank you
 four more years
 four more years
 four more years
 four more years
 four more years
 four more years
 four more years
 thank you very much
 and very importantly we've confirmed more than 158 brand new beautiful federal judges to uphold our constitution as written
 in a very short while we'll have 182 federal judges
 president obama left us 142
 thank you very much
 thank you very much president obama
 he left us 142 openings
 can you believe that
 you're supposed to leave none when you leave office but that didn't work out too well
 and just days ago the united states brought the world's number one terrorist leader to justice
 we have great military
 it was very very depleted
 when i came into office it was very very depleted but it ain't depleted anymore
 yep
 al-baghdadi the founder and leader… look you've heard about it for a long time
 i kept saying where is al-baghdadi
 that's the one i want
 where is he
 and then by the way the following day we got number two
 i don't know if you read about that
 but he was the founder and the leader of isis and he's dead
 and baghdadi he was a savage and soulless monster but his reign of terror is over
 american special operators executed a masterful raid that ended his wretched life and punched out his ticket to hell i guess you could say
 he spent his last miserable moments on earth cowering and trembling and crying in fear of the american warrior that was right there going right up
 no enemy stands a chance against the righteous bite of the united states military and mississippi loves our military that i can tell you
 and our military loves mississippi
 america is winning again and america is all over the world respected again
 it's about time
 but while we're creating jobs and killing terrorists the democrat party has gone completely insane
 the radical left is determined to transform america into a country you would not recognize
 we are the ones standing in their way and we will never get out of their way
 it will be easy
 from even before we won the election the far-left democrats and the fake news media right back there… look at all of them oh
 it's too bad we get such good ratings because if we didn't they wouldn't be here
 look at how many
 it's like the academy awards before it failed
 right
 and you know why it failed
 because they disrespected us
 but the media and the democrats have been engaged in a corrupt partnership trying to impose their will and to thwart american democracy by any means necessary
 you see what's going on
 first they engineered the russia hoax
 that was a total hoax the single greatest lies ever foisted upon the american people
 then the mueller witch hunt it never ended
 with 18 angry democrats and an unlimited budget let's go get him
 that didn't work out too well did it
 that fizzled
 and a lot of bad people along the way
 and now corrupt politicians nancy pelosi- … and shifty adam schiff shifty
 and the media are continuing with the deranged impeachment witch hunt
 this is one i never thought i'd be involved in
 the word impeachment… to me it's a dirty word not a good word
 totally phony deal
 they know it
 everybody knows it and that's why we've never had greater support than we have right now
 it's true
 and if you think you have a lot of people in this room all you have to do is go outside
 you'll see a lot more people trying to get in
 so if anybody wants to give up your seat please just walk out
 anybody want to leave
 because there really is
 there's no place better to have a rally to have a good time and to also at the same time be very serious than at a trump rally especially on friday night in mississippi
 we could have done this one on monday night
 i said let's do friday
 right
 yesterday the democrats voted to potentially nullify the votes of 63 million americans disgracing themselves and bringing shame upon the house of representatives
 they've been plotting to overthrow the election since the moment i won
 but the people here that are highly sophisticated though long before i won
 19 minutes after i took the oath of office the horrible newspaper fake fake fake washington post declared the campaign to impeach president trump has just begun
 at least they gave us 19 minutes
 yesterday's vote by the radical democrats is an attack on democracy itself
 but i'll tell you the republicans are really strong the strongest i've ever seen them the most unified i've ever seen them
 right
 the most unified i've ever seen them
 the american people are fed up with democrat lies hoaxes and extremism
 the democrats' outrageous conduct has created an angry majority that will vote many do-nothing democrats out of office in 2020
 make no mistake
 they are coming after the republican party and me because i'm fighting for you
 they don't like it
 this is different
 they've never had anything like this
 well they've never had an election like 2016 either have they
 they never have
 they've never quite figured it out
 you're the man
 and they know they can't win so let's try and impeach him
 how about that crazy representative al green right
 you know we got to impeach him because we can't beat him
 i don't think so
 right
 i don't think so
 al green he's another beauty
 the democrats the media and the deep state are desperate to stop us
 and it's not me it's us
 it's all of us
 it's 63 million but it's much more than 63 million
 much more
 and right now our numbers are higher than they've ever been before
 they've never been this high
 but they want to stop us because they know we are here and that's what we're doing and that's what's taking up so much time
 we're draining the swamp in washington
 nothing terrifies democrats more than the fact that all of their spying… spying
 they actually spied on my campaign
 can you believe it
 i mean you know they try and say well we were actually just checking things out
 oh that's wonderful
 the lying the falsifying over the past three years plus before i ever even announced they were spying
 i guess they knew we were going to win right
 but over that past more than three years is finally being exposed
 and remember this that truth is a force of nature
 desperate to conceal their misdeeds the democrats are now attacking us for calling out the grave corruption of the bidens just like they melted down when we pointed out crooked hillary's shocking and very many misdeeds
 33000 emails
 33000 emails disappeared but she said they only had to do with her working out at her daughter's wedding
 33
 lock her up
 lock her up
 lock her up
 lock her up
 lock her up
 lock her up
 lock her up
 lock her up
 lock her up
 lock her up
 lock her up
 lock her up
 lock her up
 she's a beauty
 how about last week
 did you hear
 i don't know who tulsi gabbard is but i know one thing
 she's not an agent of russia
 and jill stein she's a greenie
 that's fine
 we love the environment everybody in this room
 you know right now we have the cleanest air and the cleanest water that we've ever had and yet we're number one in the world in energy by far
 we took over
 but i don't know jill stein
 she ran last time
 i don't know but i know she's not an agent of russia
 and when hillary made those statements two statements both of them they work for russia they're agents of… i said you know when she made that statement about me three years ago it took me two years to get out of that hoax statement
 she made it about them
 everybody laughed because of what we proved
 but i'll tell you what these are very bad people
 these are very dishonest people and the media is worse than all of them
 but think about the preposterous hoax the democrats are now trying to peddle
 i've just beaten with no… look look we didn't have too much political experience
 i did a good job built lots of buildings all over the place had great success in show business
 just did one show
 it was called the apprentice and it was a big success
 14 seasons
 and when i left crazy arnold took over
 it didn't do too well
 it was dead
 it was dead from the first episode
 i saw him i said oh it's terrible
 what have they done to this beautiful show
 arnold
 but think of it
 i've just beaten with no political experience the clinton dynasty the bush dynasty the president barack hussein obama dynasty
 and president obama worked harder at defeating me than crooked hillary clinton did right
 he was all over the place
 it's the only time i've actually seen him work hard when it came to trying to beat trump
 true
 true
 remember he said… remember he said he will not be president
 well that didn't work out so well
 and then they figured they could take us out a different way very dishonesty right with the lying and the spying and the leaking
 and we are kicking their ass
 i'll tell you
 in the delusional democrat fantasy i'm now supposed to be afraid of someone called 1 joe
 i used to call him 1 because you could never get 1 in the primaries
 then he got brought out by obama out of the trash heap became vice president
 but we've now named him very slow sleepy joe
 very slow
 he's gotten slower and slower
 i'm afraid if he gets a nomination he'll be so slow we'll have the lowest-rated debates in history as opposed to the highest-rated debates in history against crooked hillary
 in fact i don't even think that sleepy joe will get it
 but many people are running
 so you know it's so early
 i don't want to talk about their campaign
 oh did you hear beto
 beto
 did you hear beto
 beto
 oh that poor bastard
 well poor pathetic guy
 he was pathetic
 remember the arms a-flailing
 remember that
 you know he ran against ted cruz
 ted cruz won
 he spent almost 100 million dollars and ted cruz… and i helped ted and we campaigned together and it was good
 but i used to watch him
 then when he came onto the really big stage this crazy stage i noticed he was flailing with the arms and he was standing on tables
 he was standing on countertops
 i said does he ever stand on the floor and speak
 but he's waving his arms and going crazy and i said what the hell is he doing
 what is he on
 and do you remember he made the statement that he was born for this
 anybody that says he was born for this they're in trouble
 i used to have guys come into my office sir i'm the greatest salesman
 nobody can sell… you know the truth is anybody that says they're a great salesman usually they're not a very good salesman
 it's true
 it's those sneaky ones in the back that don't talk that you don't know about
 they're the ones
 but beto was nasty and he said that he was born for it like he was born from heaven
 he came down
 and if that's the case some really bad things happen because he made a total fool out of himself
 and he came out of texas the great state of texas
 he came out of texas a very hot political property and he went back as cold as you can be
 so he was a nasty guy but he had a couple of policies that don't work well in the state of texas
 right
 he was against religion
 he was against you having a gun
 and he was against oil
 so you come from texas you don't like religion you don't like oil and you don't have guns
 i don't know
 that's not a good combination in the state of texas
 that's not good in mississippi either
 i don't know it's that good anywhere
 nah he went back home to texas and hopefully we won't be hearing about him for a long time
 it's amazing how cold you could get so quickly but he was a nasty guy
 but in the twist… oh alabama
 love alabama
 i love alabama
 i love alabama
 it's a great place
 but in the very twisted and corrupt world of adam schiff after beating the entire political establishment and that means bush and that means clinton and that means obama they have me supposedly saying to myself well let's see
 i got a guy named sleepy joe biden
 how do i beat him
 how do i beat him
 how do i beat this guy
 he's such a great
 clinton she was easy
 right
 obama was easy
 the bush dynasty was
 but sleepy joe i'm worried about right
 so then i said to myself gee i guess there's only one way
 let's call up ukraine for help
 these people are sick
 these people are sick
 now these dishonest people will take the last little sliver and the first little sliver and they'll put it because they're so damn dishonest and they'll just say- … let's use ukraine for help
 that's what they're going to say
 and they won't show the laughter and they won't show the sarcasm and they won't show the fun because they're the most dishonorable people almost on earth
 it's a disgrace
 but we say it anyway
 and here's the good news
 the people get it
 so they have a brand new president in ukraine
 good guy by the way
 and i call a brand new person a man i have no idea who he is and i'm on a phone right
 and i know many people are on the phone because when you call the leaders of country many people listen
 and i'm on the phone and they want me to say to this brand new president just got there called to congratulate him please could you help me please
 i don't know who he is
 i didn't know his name until i looked down the card i see
 and he's a nice guy and hopefully he's going to root out corruption because ukraine has tremendous corruption problems
 and one of the reasons i held up money very important corruption
 but the other reason… why isn't germany and france and uk and all of these european nations that are right there… why aren't they doing things that they're supposed to do
 why is it always the united states
 so i made this call had this wonderful call and the transcript proves it was as i said perfect
 it was perfect
 it wasn't like almost… it was perfect
 it was totally appropriate
 i made it at the behest of people to say could you call and say hello
 now i'm an honest person anyway
 but do you think when i'm making a call to a newly-elected president of a country that i would say something improper when i know there are so many people listening on the line
 many people
 whoever the hell wants to listen they listen and they have me making some kind of a deal with all these people
 and remember the new president of ukraine is speaking to the united states of america the president
 i guarantee he's got a lot of people listening too
 these people are sick
  no pressure
 they must think we're nuts to be honest
 it's all a phony deal this whole impeachment scam to try to undermine the 2020 election and to de-legitimatize one of the greatest elections maybe the greatest … i mean let's give george washington credit but everybody expected he was going to win that we've ever had
 so my phone call which was totally perfect and appropriate and if you want to read the transcript you see how perfect it was but they don't quit
 but what you should do is take a look at the behavior of sleepy joe
 so i quote i said … let me act like him
 i've got to speak really slow though and … i said ‘you're not getting a billion
' i looked at them and i said ‘i'm leaving in six hours
 if the prosecutor isn't fired you're not getting the money
 you understand
 you're not getting the money
' then he goes at the end … i didn't know he had this kind of energy
 he goes well son of a bitch he got fired
 you know in a certain way i was impressed because i mean i didn't think he had the energy the brain power
 it's turned out he doesn't
 by the way he's dropping like a rock
 when you're at 1 there's always a reason
 he should be there fairly soon
 as you know the ukrainian prosecutor that biden got fired after threatening to withhold i think it was 1 billion or something in aid was the prosecutor investigating his son's company that was paying hunter biden a guy just got thrown out of the navy … he was paying them millions of dollars even though working for an energy company he had no experience with energy
 he knew less about it than this young … how old are you
 six
 this young beautiful person in front of me
 six
 and this young six-year-old is smarter so i think i'd basically go with her
 so what is it all about
 it's called a payoff but you know what
 the fake news they apologize
 i watched this horrible guy who gets lousy ratings anderson cooper
 well the hatred i mean between him and fredo
 you've got fredo and … that's cuomo fredo
 i call him fredo like from the movie
 now i watched anderson cooper and i watched him apologize for even asking the question to biden
 the good news is biden didn't know too much about what the hell he was talking about
 remember biden said i don't know these people
 i don't know them
 i don't know them
  we're dealing with life right
 he never spoke to him
 unfortunately the next day … in the world of the internet in the world of smart people … that's why i like beto he wasn't smart couldn't handle it
 i told my wife i said see it's not so easy
 i told our great first lady tonight who people love
 they love her
 when beto quit he quit like a dog
 when he quit i said see people think this is easy
 this isn't easy but it just worked out that way
 but biden said i never met the people never met the gentlemen
 unfortunately in about 10 seconds a picture came out where they're playing golf together but he never met him
 so now you'll ask him he'll say no we played around a golf
 we were together for three hours
 i never mentioned the fact that they're paying my son millions
 oh no no no
 … well they might be watching us
 i guess they do watch us
 he used to interview me
 he was so nice
 prior to running for politics he was so nice to me
 it was like they were love fests but i don't want anything to do with him
 they were love fests
 what a thought
 he's weak
 he's a weak person but they're all weak
 but let me just tell you something
 we need honesty with our media
 we need honesty because the new york times the washington post … and by the way i don't know you probably read it
 we threw them out at the white house
 we don't show them anymore
 if somebody wants to go and buy them
 we threw them out
 and they came into my office and then i got to get back to this guy
 where's hunter
 where's hunter
 we had a tee shirt made where's hunter
 where's hunter
 poor hunter
 he then came out he did the morning show
 that was the last we've seen of hunter
 that wasn't good
 the morning of his father's very bad debate but it's where is hunter
 but before i say the final thing on hunter and then we put him to rest for a while we got rid of the washington post and the failing new york times
 we got rid of them right
 we don't have them in the white house
 i said no you could … people can go out and buy them but we don't … we used to have them stacked up and i'd go in and i'd see a meeting with my people and they're dealing with china south korea or somebody
 and i'd go into these offices
 i'd see 10 or 15 of them packed up all over the place the washington post and the new york times
 i keep trying to figure out who's worse
 and one day it's the times one day it's the post
 it's like top each other they're so bad
 it's so phony
 in my opinion it's virtually corrupt
 i've never seen it
 you never have a good story
 i mean even when we got al-baghdadi the washington post had a story that he was like a great religious cleric
 where did that come from
 the other thing if obama would have done it … because look
 this guy built isis
 the caliphate it was the size physically of ohio the state of ohio the great state of ohio
 that's a big lot of land
 7 million people and they were the ones the orange jumpsuits
 i called a lot of the parents after we did this and i talked to them and they were … how can you be happy
 but they were so thrilled that we got this animal
 they were so thrilled
 but you know what
 and you know what
 we don't do it for … we do it because it's right
 that story was a massive story
 that was the biggest maybe the biggest one of the biggest ever
 bigger than anything
 that story disappeared so fast
 done
 and that's okay
 i didn't do it for the story
 i did it because it's the right thing to do
 but if i were a democrat they'd be talking about that story for weeks
 with me they don't even want to … they actually played it down
 and actually and i'm happy about this conan the dog got more publicity than me
 and i'm very happy with that
 i'm very … conan is incredible
 and conan's coming to the white house in a few weeks
 but it is true
 did you ever see a story disappear so fast
 i mean if obama had that story that thing would be going on for another seven months
 they'd be talking about his bravery
 oh so bravery
 but again 142 judges he gave us
 remember that
 how can you be a great … they always say the most important thing a president can do is federal judges
 we got two supreme courts
 great ones
 great judge
 gorsuch and kavanaugh great judges
 by the way did you ever see any human being treated worse than now-justice kavanaugh
 did anybody ever
 was any human being by these people these horrible horrible people that we have to deal with
 anyway just to finish
 so hunter then goes to china
 now i'm dealing with china right now
 they don't like me too much
 they dream about the day when somebody else … and would they like to have … how about this
 you give this son who has zero experience with investing too you give him 1
5 billion to invest meaning he makes millions and millions of dollars and the biggest guys on wall street can't get it
 he walks out with 1
5 billion
 and then there are other places also i understand
 folks it's disgraceful that the press doesn't cover it for what it is
 it's a payoff
 it's a payoff
 and how would you like to have sleepy joe with the son getting all of this money from china become president and take over the china deal
 they are not liking me
 they had the worst year that they've had in 57 years
 their supply chain is broken up like scrambled eggs and they want to make a deal because those tariffs have given us millions of dollars and billions now billions and billions of dollars
 we're taking billions and billions of dollars and you know what we're doing with some of it
 just a small portion but 100 they're taking care of … our farmers got 16 billion last year and 12 billion the year before because they targeted our farmers because they know the farmers love trump and trump loves the farmers
 so they targeted them and they brought the 16 billion down to practically nothing
 and they thought our farmers would say oh we don't like trump
 they did just the opposite
 they said we know he's doing the right thing because we've been ripped off for so many years
 but i said to him i said to secretary of agriculture sonny purdue a great guy
 i said sonny how much did they spend buying our corn and soy beans and all of our agricultural product
 he said sir 16 billion
 i said good i'll make it up
 and we're going to have a lot leftover
 so we will have pretty soon over 100 billion in money paid into the united states treasury by a country that never gave us 25 cents
 they only took
 they only took
 so when i said to the farmers we're going to send you 16 billion and it's already been sent
 and it's been split into 12 billion the year before
 i mean think of that 28 billion
 i said compliments of china
 and we had a lot left over
 not bad right
 not bad
 you think obama would do that
 i don't think so
 you think hillary would do that
 i don't think so
 you think sleepy joe would do that
 i don't think so
 he wouldn't know what you're talking about
 on tuesday the proud people of mississippi will send democrats a clear message
 it's very important for this reason as well as the fact that you have a great gentleman in your midst
 but you have to reject their extremism and their socialism and their corruption
 they're corrupt
 adam schiff is a corrupt politician
 you know when he made that phony speech where he made up a really horrible speech and said that i said it i said oh i'm going to sue him
 they said sir i'm sorry
 you can't
 he's got total immunity because he made it in congress
 can you believe this
 but here's the good news
 at least we have a forum we have a place we can talk so everyone knows what's going on
 a bunch of phony people but this is why we have to send a signal and why you have to make tate reeves your great new republican … right
 republican governor right
 hey he's a great guy too
 and all i know is he's loved and respected by your current governor because phil is some piece of work
 phil is so confident
 i wanted phil to run for a certain office then i wanted him to do something
 i've tried to get him but some guys are confident
 phil said no sir i've been doing this all my life
 i love the people
 he built the most beautiful african-american museum
 phil he's the greatest but he built the most beautiful … but he's got confidence
 and he said no sir i'd been doing it
 i don't really want to do that
 in other words he said that's enough
 … oh we love our police right
 i love our police
 we love our police
 he'll oppose sanctuary cities which is just terrible
 they're terrible
 and tate will always defend your second amendment
 so tate's running against a liberal democrat named jim hood
 now all i know about jim hood is he fought very hard to elect crooked hillary clinton and barack hussein obama
 isn't that nice
 he wanted obama to win so badly and then he wanted hillary to win
 and that's not the kind of guy we need here
 not in mississippi
 he's supported by extreme leftists like stacey abrams who by the way went down to defeat in front of a terrific gentlemen from the great state of georgia brian kemp
 and they came in with … oh they brought them all
 they had president obama they had michelle obama they had oprah winfrey
 they came in and all he had was donald trump and we won
 we won fairly easily
 but stacey abrams wants to give illegal aliens the right to vote
 do you believe this
 i mean some of these people they want to give them education
 they want to give them this
 they want to give them free healthcare
 they want to give these people that come into our country illegally all benefits and he opposed our travel ban which is so important that we won in the united states supreme court to keep terrorists the hell out of our country
 and jim hood went to the united nations and opposed your right to self-defense
 if you don't want a far left democrat running mississippi … wait a minute
 how's this guy
 i can't believe this is a competitive race
 it's embarrassing
 i'm talking to mississippi
 i'm talking to mississippi
 i can't believe it
 i don't think that he's going to be the right guy
 i think the guy that you want is tate reeves
 he's going to be fantastic
 he will be a great great governor
 tate come on up
 tate
 thank you tate
 tuesday go out and vote for tate
 he'll never let you down
 and don't kid yourself
 your second amendment is under attack but not with him
 it's under attack
 so we're also joined tonight by a man who is truly and i've sort of said it a lot but he's been a great governor and he loves your state
 he loves the people of this great state governor phil bryant
 where's phil
 come up phil
 come up
 oh he's central casting
 look at him
 come here phil
 thank you phil
 thank you
 thank you my phil
 what a job

 you have to continue that whole thing going forward
 so another man who's a warrior is a friend of mine
 whenever there's a problem he's there
 he's always there
 he'll be right at the front
 he is tough
 he is smart
 he's brilliant actually
 and he loves this state and he loves you people
 senator roger wicker

 she's tough and smart and strong and she's with us all the way
 cindy hyde-smith
  trent kelly michael guest

 your next secretary of state michael watson
 great people
 your next state treasure david mcrae
 state auditor shad white
 agriculture commissioner andy gipson
 insurance commissioner mike chaney
 and former governor a man that nobody's ever heard of in this room i'm sure but the truth is he's a legend in politics and a great guy
 he's a great guy haley barbour
 … hourly earnings are up 9 in mississippi since the election
 under the previous two administrations we lost 60000 factories in our country
 under my administration we've already added nearly 10000 new factories and many more are coming in as we speak
 to get relief to working families we passed massive tax cuts on average 2000 to 2500 per family bringing almost 1 trillion back home to our shores
 what's happening
 you couldn't get the money
 the big companies they couldn't get their money back both bureaucratically and from a tax standpoint
 they brought back almost 1 trillion now because of us
 all put to work
 we slashed the largest number in history of job-killing regulations and we ended the war on american energy
 we are now the number one producer of energy by far anywhere in the world
 for decades you saw corrupt politicians take money from lobbyists to impose catastrophic trade deals
 mississippi lost 40 of all manufacturing jobs after the twin disasters of nafta and china's entrance into the world trade organization
 two of the worst deals ever made by our country
 100000 mississippi jobs were wiped away just like that and that's awful and a big price to pay for washington's disloyalty to the american worker
 that's what it was
 it was disloyalty stupidity corruption lots of reasons
 but now you finally have a president who is loyal to you and i am
 i'm a fighter for your jobs for your wages your factories your families and your dignity
 we're stopping china from ripping us off
 we're stopping all of these other countries from taking advantage of the united states where we lose our money we lose our wealth we lose our jobs we close our factories
 that's not happening anymore
 it's reversed
 we were the sucker country for years and years but we are not the sucker country anymore and they all know it
 we're replacing nafta … and that was a disaster nafta … with the brand new us mexico canada agreement if nancy pelosi will ever put it up to a vote which is questionable
 nervous nancy she doesn't want to give the people of our country a victory
 she's very busy doing other things
 having fun
 the usmca will be a massive victory for mississippi's farmers and also includes powerful protections for mississippi auto workers manufacturers and everybody else
 it's a great agreement
 about time we got rid of nafta
 the do-nothing democrats need to stop their madness and pass the usmca right now
 the last administration's horrendous trans-pacific partnership would have destroyed the us auto industry but i proudly first thing withdrew from that job-killing calamity
 under our policies toyota has just announced a 170 million investment in mississippi and 400 new jobs at its facility … did you ever hear of this place … blue springs
 blue springs
 before my election our leaders used the great american middle class as a piggy bank to fund their delusional global projects all over the world
 we take care of other people
 we take care of other countries but we don't take care of our own
 they knowingly decimated american manufacturing to promote economic growth in foreign countries
 they deployed our military to protect … think of this … immensely wealthy nations subsidizing their welfare states with your money
 i ask those wealthy nations now i respectfully the other day said to the king of saudi arabia king we're going to help you but you've got to pay
 and he was great
 no he was great
 he was great
 he said but nobody has ever asked before
 i said but i'm asking
 and billions of dollars will come in and we're protecting a great ally
 we have a country that spends billions and billions of dollars in our country buying military and other things
 but we said you're very wealthy
 you have to pay and they're going to pay
 and that's true with many countries by the way
 that's true with many countries
 they never respected us
 they could never believe it
 i said to one country … i have great respect for the prime minister of japan
 i said to prime minister i said how did you get away with this for so long
 and he looked at me and he couldn't really answer it because how the hell did this happen
 we're protecting 94 countries
 ask china how many countries are you protecting president xi
 and they look at me like what a stupid question
 we protect one
 china
 you ask president putin how many countries are you protecting president putin
 and he looks and he goes russia
 you ask other countries … we're protecting at least 94
 in fact so many they can't even tell me
 i've been trying to get an answer for four months
 so many they can't even tell
 it's crazy but it's all beautiful the way it's happening
 a lot of good things are happening
 but these same politicians poured precious american blood and treasure into the sands of the middle east while allowing our cities to fall into disrepair and decay
 our failed ruling class believed it was their right to rule over you to take your money to take your jobs to redistribute your wealth all over the globe wherever they wanted it
 but i don't like that
 i don't like that
 the great sellout has ended and it ended the day i took the oath of office
 that was quite a day
 after years of building up foreign nations we are finally building up our nation
 we are finally putting america first
 our policy of never-ending war regime change and nation-building is being replaced by the clear-eyed pursuit of american interests
 it is the job of our military to protect our security not to be the policemen of the world
 proving the wisdom of this approach we recently secured a permanent ceasefire in northern syria without spilling one drop of american blood
 not one drop
 actually i have to be honest
 one soldier stepped on a nail
 that's true
 i said don't tell the press that because they'll say but one soldier stepped in a nail
 i said how bad was it
 it's okay
 i said don't mention it please
 they always like to mention exactly what happened
 you can take it a little bit low key
 stepped on a nail
 not a drop of blood
 and we don't have to defend the borders between turkey and syria
 they've been fighting for 1000 years
 but what we do is we did keep the oil if you don't mind
 we kept the oil
 we kept the oil
 and we'll distribute that oil we'll help out the kurds and we'll help out other people
 we'll also help out ourselves if that's okay
 past leaders foolish military adventures turned far away nations into very very dangerous war zones
 then they demanded that american citizens accept unlimited migration from those terror-afflicted nations and regions
 i don't think so
 i don't think so
 we did not fight them over there only to invite them over here
 we don't want to do that
 to protect our communities my administration restricted migration from terror-prone nations and implemented the toughest ever vetting procedures
 toughest ever that we've ever had
 no issue has ever been so horribly discarded by a party as that issue by the democrats
 they want open borders which mean crime
 they want sanctuary cities which means crime and drugs and death
 after bleeding the middle class dry democrats threw open our borders to the world flooding our communities with poisonous drugs and criminal cartels
 republicans believe in strong borders and safe communities
 we are now building a wall
 we're building it
 we're building it
 and you think that was easy
 the democrats they didn't want that wall
 i got money for everything but when it came to the wall not 25 cents
 not 25 cents
 but we gave the military a lot of money and we took it from the military and we took it from here we took it from there
 or we had to go to court and all of a sudden we start winning cases
 we're winning cases now
 winning a lot of cases
 but the wall is going up rapidly
 it's going up rapidly
 and this is a very serious wall
 this is the exact everything they wanted
 i went to the border patrol incredible people and ice
 incredible people tough people
 they love our country
 and i said give me the specifications for the wall
 they said well sir we'd like steel but would also like concrete and would also like rebar
 i said well what do you want
 which one
 so i did all three because it's a different form of cutting
 you can cut through steel but you can't through the concrete and then you can't through the hardened rebar
 we got it all
 and we also need see-through sir
 got to see who's on the other side
 that makes sense right
 not just concrete
 it's more expensive what we're doing but we're giving and we're building … we should have anywhere from 400 to almost 500 miles of wall built by the end of next year
 it's going up fast
 in all the right areas
 in all the right areas
 that was a tough one
 and the army corps of engineers is building their hearts out
 they're great
 great people
 we believe in keeping terrorists and criminals and drug dealers the hell out of our country
 and thanks to our tireless efforts on the southern border tough place illegal crossings have dropped 60 since may and we are faster than ever securing the southern border
 and soon it will be when the wall is completed secure like it's never been before
 and i want to thank the country of mexico
 they right now have 27000 soldiers on our borders
 27000
 you know what that is
 and they are keeping people out
 and i want to thank the president of mexico
 he's an excellent person great man
 and we appreciate it
 and the reason is that our democrats won't even approve things called loopholes
 they're loopholes
 that's a horrible name right
 that means it's a loophole
 that means you can come in illegally and lots of things
 catch and release
 you catch them
 then you've got to release them
 by law you've got to release them or they'll arrest the border patrol agent if they don't release
 it's crazy
 but we could end this in 15 minutes but they don't want to do it
 they don't want to do it
 they're obstructionists
 they're colluders
 and we can't let it happen
 that's why you have to go with tate reeves
 tate's going to send a big signal by the way
 it's a big signal
 it's great for you
 he's going to be a great governor
 it also sends a big signal to these radical left crazy democrats
 it's very important that tate wins
 very important
 we're also fighting deadly sanctuary cities with the help of states like mississippi which has banned sanctuary cities because phil bryant said we're not going to have them and roger wicker said we're not going to have them
 and cindy said we're not going to have them
 democrats' sanctuary cities forced the release of dangerous criminal aliens onto our streets
 if you want a governor who will stand proudly with the heroes of ice … and they are heroes i wouldn't want their job
 ms-13 they walk right into those nests … they call them a nest … and they start swinging
 you never saw anything like it
 i'll say you know what
 better you than me
 let's see who would do good
 he'd do good
 that guy
 that guy would do good
 most of you wouldn't do too good
 no
 i mean these guys are tough guys and they love our country
 who would do it
 they're moving thousands of people from ms-13
 these gangs are the worst people
 these people these are not human beings
 you know i said that once before and this crazy nancy pelosi said how dare you say they're not human
 you ever see these people
 and they slice people up with a knife because it's more painful than using a gun
 and then i have to defend myself when i say they're animals
 but you know what
 i never changed
 i didn't say oh i'd like to apologize
 i'd like to apologize
 crazy nancy
 and you got to look at her district in san francisco
 she's spending all her time on this crap or this impeachment stuff
 take a look at what's happening to the great city once of san francisco
 it's thousands and thousands of tents and drugs and needles and everything you can imagine floating in the streets in the best neighborhoods
 nancy pelosi go home and fix your district nancy
 go home and fix your district
 go home and fix your district
 if you want a governor who will stand proudly with the heroes of ice and border patrol vote for tate reeves
 tuesday
 got to get out
 you got to get out
 got to send the signal
 let it be a big victory too
 the democrat party has never been more extreme you know that than it is today
 the democrat healthcare agenda would obliterate medicare
 i will always protect medicare for our seniors and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions
 always
 we'll always take care of them
 virtually every democrat also now supports late-term abortion ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up until the moment of birth
 well the governor of virginia executed a baby
 remember that whole thing
 after birth after birth
 some people never heard of it
 he said the baby is born and then he starts talking to the mother
 nobody ever heard that
 that is why i've asked congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from god
 democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late-term abortion socialism and blatant corruption
 the republican party is the party of the american worker the american family the american dream
 nobody has done more for the african american community than the republican party
 and we're also the party of abraham lincoln
 we can't forget that
 people forget
 abraham lincoln
 honest abe
 to lift up distressed communities we created opportunities zones
 so incredible
 so successful
 including 100 new opportunity zones right now in mississippi where money is now flowing in to build and to fix
 and tim scott i give him so much credit from the great state of south carolina choices
 they can go out get a doctor we pay the bill and they don't have to wait six weeks four weeks two weeks
 we had people waiting in line
 they weren't very sick
 by the time they saw the doctor they were terminally ill
 now they go on and they go and they go outside and they find a doctor and we take care of our great veterans
 the great rebuilding of the american armed forces has included massive investments in the military and facilities in biloxi and gulfport and jackson and starkville
 and roger has been fantastic
 and cindy hyde-smith has been fantastic
 thank you
 thank you
 thank you
 to protect america's security i withdrew the united states from the horrible one-sided iran nuclear deal
 it's not the same country anymore
 nothing's easy but it's not the same
 and i recognized israel's true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem
 for years you watch as your politicians apologize for america
 now you have a president who is standing up for america and we are standing up for the people of mississippi
 the next step to victory begins on tuesday right here in your great state
 with your support we will show the corrupt democrats that the american people are not ever going to back down from perhaps the greatest victory in political history
 and you know today with the new stock market at an all-time high it's … i will tell you something … if we didn't win this election that stock market would be in one-half
 it was heading in the wrong direction
 it was going to fail
 and if they ever did anything bad if they ever do anything bad to us if they ever succeed in their wildest dream which will never let them happen that stock market will crash like you've never seen a crash before
 and you will not be happy with your 401ks like you're happy right now because they don't know what they're doing
 they don't know what they're doing
 and i'd like to speak well but the leadership they have no clue
 they're just very vicious people
 actually they're sort of mentally violent people but we've got it under control
 it always helps when you didn't do anything wrong
 i always say how do you impeach a president who didn't do anything wrong
 so we're going to send a signal by sending a terrific new republican governor to jackson
 on tuesday you're going to get out and you're going to vote and you're going to give up whatever you have to give up
 you're going to leave work maybe a little early or maybe get there a little late
 tell your boss i said it was okay
 i will give you a pardon if i have to
 i'll give you a one-hour pardon
 but with your help we will lift millions more of our great citizens from welfare to work dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity
 together we will elect a republican congress to create a fair safe sane and lawful system of immigration
 and you have great congressmen here and i'll tell you i want to appreciate it fellas
 warriors you're warriors
 you are warriors
 what was it
 196 for and nothing against right
 that doesn't happen with republicans
 it doesn't happen
 i always complain
 i always say the democrats are lousy politicians
 they have lousy policies
 open borders sanctuary cities but they have one thing
 they stick together and they're vicious
 the republicans have great policy
 in many ways they're better politicians but they're not as vicious
 thank you darling
 i appreciate it
 they're not as vicious but they have a tendency to split apart
 the democrats don't seem to have any mitt romneys
 we do
 we do
 i don't know
 maybe he'll get better
 maybe he'll get better
 we'll see
 we'll see what happens
 maybe he'll get better
 just let it be fair but they don't have that
 we will enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with those beautiful beautiful words ‘made in the usa
' made in america
 we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the aids epidemic in america
 can you believe that
 within 10 years it will be over
 when they told me that i said that's incredible
 we're going to end the aids epidemic within 10 years
 it's funded
 nobody would have thought we could do that but we're doing it
 we'll have it ended in america in 10 years
 the aids epidemic
 who would've thought
 we will defend privacy free speech free assembly religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms
 above all we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one america
 we support protect and defend the constitution of the united states
 we stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement
 we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life
 we believe that faith and family not government and bureaucracy are the true american way
 we believe that children should be taught to love our country honor our history and to always respect our great american flag
 and we live by the words of our national motto and we always will
 you'll never see it disappear
 in god we trust
 we stand on the shoulders of american patriots who crossed the oceans settled the continent tamed the wilderness dug out the panama canal laid down the railroads revolutionized industry pioneered technology won two world wars defeated fascism and communism and made america the single greatest nation in the history of the world
 and today it's greater than ever before
 proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country
 that's what we're doing
 that's what happened in 2016
 we are returning power to you the american people
 with your help your devotion and your drive we are going to keep on working
 we are going to keep on fighting
 and we are going to keep on winning winning winning
 we'll get so tired of winning
 i don't know mississippi
 you're winning
 you had the best year you've ever had
 you have the best mississippi the best year you've ever had in the history of our country
 mississippi
 your statistic
 mississippi aren't you getting tired of winning
 i guess not
 so phil doesn't come to me and say sir please we're willing too much
 the people of mississippi can't take it anymore
 i don't think you'll ever have to make that trip
 i don't think he's ever going to have to and i don't think tate will ever have to make that trip
 we are one movement one people one family and one glorious nation under god
 america is thriving like never before
 and ladies and gentlemen of mississippi the best is yet to come
 because together we will make america wealthy again
 we will make america strong again
 we will make america proud again
 we will make america safe again
 and we will make america great again
 thank you mississippi
