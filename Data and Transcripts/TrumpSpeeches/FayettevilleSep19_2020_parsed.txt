what a crowd what a crowd
 get those people over here
 see me
 let them come over
 what is a big crowd it's always big
 we want to win
 we got to win
 we want to save our country from the radical left the radical left crazies
 thank you very much
 and hello north carolina hello north carolina
 we love you north carolina
 i'm thrilled to be in fayetteville with thousands of loyal hard working american patriots
 and you know what's going to happen in 45 days from now and you're watching those polls
 they go up up up up
 45 days from now we're going to win north carolina
 we're going to win four more years in the white house
 as we meet tonight our nation mourns the loss of a legal giant supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg
 her landmark rulings fierce devotion to justice and her courageous battle against cancer inspire all americans
 you may agree
 you may not disagree with her but she was an inspiration to a tremendous number of people
 i say all americans justice ginsburg's close relationship with a friend of ours a friend of mine justice scalia is also a powerful reminder that we can disagree on fundamental issues while treating each other with decency dignity and respect
 our thoughts and prayers are with her family
 thank you very much
 so article ii of our constitution says the president shall nominate justices of the supreme court
 i don't think it can be any more clear can it
 i don't think so
 i don't think so
 what do you think thom
 thom tillis i don't think it can be any more clear
 this can only happen in north carolina
 i hope you hear that back home
 look at all that press
 that's a lot of press
 that's a lot of fake news
 well i hope they hear
 so the chant this is a new one
 fill that seat
 this is the chant
 this can only happen to me
 fill that seat
 now it says the president is supposed to fill the seat right
 and that's what we're going to do
 we're going to fill the seat
 with a great hat
 i want to try one of those hats
 i love that
 no think of it
 29 times every single time nobody said oh let's not fill the seat
 we won the election
 now then we have some senators that forget it
 think of it i won't say it
 i won't say it susan
 i won't say it susan
 but thom tillis is with us
 i can tell you that
 great
 we have great republican senators
 we have great people and we have a great country
 that's really we have a great country
 and we're going to keep it that way
 so we win an election and those are the consequences
 it's called fill that seat and that's what we're doing
 the supreme court was a very central issue in both the 2016 presidential election and then the 2018 midterm elections where by the way i didn't run
 we had a lot of people a lot of people said oh he really took a little bit of a shellacking
 not nearly as bad as others
 in fact we gained seats in the senate but they never talk about that
 they don't talk about that
 we gained two seats
 nobody talked about it
 but we didn't run
 and i had a lot of people that sir we'll never vote in 2018
 i said no no vote everybody vote
 they just didn't
 i think we were like 9 million people decided they wanted to wait and they've waited and you see what's going on
 you see what's happening
 you see the enthusiasm that we have
 which by the way we set a record in 2016
 the bad news for the democrats is we are more enthusiastic now
 not even close than we were in 2016
 we are getting crowds and this is pandemic and we're rounding the turn
 we're rounding the corner of the pandemic
 but we're having them outside
 and we shouldn't say this is some kind of a rally from now on
 it's called a protest
 we are protesters
 we're going to call on our rallies that because you see a lot of these let's call them blue states we want to be nice
 we're going to call it a protest against stupidity
 so we are going to have protests against stupidity
 and pennsylvania
 look what they're doing in pennsylvania
 a great state that's actually something very special is going to happen here in pennsylvania
 that's a commonwealth
 we always have to remember pennsylvania commonwealth
 got two of them and you better remember you get in trouble
 but we love pennsylvania
 and it's a shut down
 the governor's got it just shut down nice and tight
 and you know what
 on november 4th it's going to be opened up
 because they're trying to hurt our numbers
 but our economic numbers are so good
 they're staggering
 they're the best we've ever had
 jobs retail stock market everything
 and this is with a lot of shutdowns by democrats
 that's all they're doing
 on november 4th they'll announce we've decided to open up
 one of the teachers groups said actually one of the unions and one of the politicians in california said no we're not going to do it
 we need to do it
 we should be open by november 4th
 that was not a good thing for them to say
 that person i think was fired i think was fired
 in both the 2016 and the 2018 elections the american people chose a president and a senate majority united in their commitment to selecting nominees who believe in applying the constitution as written
 both the white house and the senate majority have a moral duty to fulfill the promises they made to the voters
 and that is exactly what we're going to do
 we said that if for any reason we have a vacancy on the united states supreme court we will fill that vacancy
 we're not going to say and by the way we have plenty of time
 there's a lot of time
 you're talking about january 20th
 so we will uphold equal justice under the law for citizens of every race color religion and creed
 i won't be putting forth a nominee next week
 it will be a woman
 it will be a woman unless wait okay let's do a poll
 oh there they are
 how many of these have you come to
 speaking of women how many of what is this number one
 like 90 they're great
 north carolina though
 i see them all over the place they're great
 anyway i hope your husbands are okay with it
 are they okay
 they're okay
 you have good husbands
 but we're going to do a vote
 so i said i love these free polls because pollsters and most of the pollsters are corrupt as far as i'm concerned
 if we believed in pollsters we wouldn't be here right now
 but we're actually getting very good
 we just had a 53 from rasmussen which is very good
 considering we won four years ago with a lot lower than 53
 history has shown that when you're at 53 you can't lose an election
 has anyone ever lost an election with a 53
 the answer is yes when the other side cheats
 that could happen that could happen
 that could happen
 you saw what happened in pennsylvania
 some state supreme court justice just ruled that they can take as long as they want to count the ballots
 that means i'll be leading and winning pennsylvania like we did last time
 yeah yeah
 we'll be leading we'll be winning pennsylvania
 we're going to win it easy
 we're going to win your state easily
 and deb what a great she's doing such a good job
 but mark just a few months ago i've been trying to get him for three years to leave and we have a great person running as you know
 really i mean really great
 does everyone know madison
 yes
 you're going to vote for madison
 he's great
 he's a great guy
 but mark had a beautiful head of black hair and i just noticed that hair's turning white very fast
 but we're doing a job
 we're very close to a great deal with tiktok tiktok but nobody cares about that anymore
 all they care about is fill that seat right
 until about 24 hours ago that's all they talked about is tiktok tiktok
 we have a deal worked out i think with walmart is going to buy it along with oracle
 larry ellison it's going to be an incredible combination
 and i said do me a favor
 could you put up 5 billion into a fund for education so we can educate people as to real history of our country the real history not the fake history
 because we're getting very close to that deal
 and all of the technology will be maintained here
 they're going to move probably to the great state of texas
 sorry we got you a lot of business when it cameâ€¦ but they're going to move into the united states which is what's important
 they're moving to the united states unbelievable company
 they're going to have 25000 jobs
 if it all goes i gave them the preliminary approval
 but they're putting up 5 billion
 and my only problem is they did it so fast
 i should have asked for more
 what happened is when i suggested they should put up a lot of money everybody said senators congressmen women everybody
 they said you can't do that
 that's never been done
 that's the problem nothing's ever been done
 and we had other companies a lot of people wanted it
 and i said you got to put up 5 million either to the treasury of the united states maybe or into some education fund or do something
 and they were sort of agreeing with me
 they thought it was okay
 and then i went to the legal legals here and i said they're going to put up 5 million give it to the united states
 sir
you can't do that
 there's no provision
 i said how the hell can there be no provision
 we're making the deal possible
 why can't they give us 5 billion dollars
 that's b that's a lot of money
 now watch the crazy democrats
 they'll go they should have gotten more money
 it's never been done before
 they should have no matter what you do
 they should have gotten more
 schumer and nancy pelosi crazy nancy
 but i'll tell you
 and i said it last night we had a great rally
 last night you saw that in a place that we're going to win
 we're going to win minnesota
 hasn't been won since 1972
 and they're all saying well we did give them back the big iron ore range
 it was obama took it away with the stroke of a pen
 he put everybody out of work
 we gave it back
 but i'll tell you what we're going to have a victory on november 3rd the likes of which you've never seen
 now we're counting on the federal court system to make it so that we can actually have an evening where we know who wins
 not where the votes are going to be counted a week later or two weeks later
 but in just three and a half years under my administration we've secured america's borders rebuilt the awesome power of the u
s military think of that
 and i shouldn't say this and the fake news keeps going oh he's given away classified information
 no i'm not
 we are building and we have built weapons the likes of which this world has never seen before
 and i said that a week ago and it was a headline and one of these fake newspapers where he's giving away confidential information these people are crazy
 no no
 i'm just telling you that- crazy
 no no
 i'm just telling you that president putin and president xi of china russia china north korea everybody
 they are so envious of what we're doing
 they can't even believe it
 if they know they perhaps don't know
 under obama they knew immediately okay
 under us but we are building weapons all made in the usa
 the likes of which no country has ever seen before
 and hope to god we never have to use them
 that's the key i don't ever want to use them
 remember i was supposed to be a guy that was going to get us into a war in the first week
 remember that
 where's the war
 we're taking them out of afghanistan
 we're almost finished with that
 working along well
 we're taking them out of syria other than i left some behind for the oil we kept the oil is it okay that we kept the oil
 is it okay we kept the oil
 let's go back to my poll
 ready
 so we're putting i think it should be a woman because i actually like women much more than i like men i have to say
 no i do
 i do i like women more
 so i have to make a decision to fill the seat as we say we should have a new campaign
 let's make a t-shirt fill the seat
 okay
 my people are so good tomorrow it'll be all over the place
 that's a good idea
 that's a good idea
 fill the seat
 okay watch this so good tomorrow you'll see them all over the place fill the seat
 i don't know how the hell they do it but they get it done fast
 you remember i said where's hunter
 where's hunter
 the next day it was like one of the biggest selling t- shirts where is hunter
 what the hell ever happened
 he took the money and he ran i think
 where's hunter
 he took the money he went to china he took 1
5 billion
 he had no experience
 he didn't have a job until this guy became vice president
 then he went to china he got 1
5 billion
 i asked the head of a great company blackstone
 one of the biggest in the world
 i said steve let me ask you a question
 is that possible
 no that's never done
 china doesn't do that
 well how did a guy with no experience do this
 he said very simple
 his father's vice president
 is that what you want
 and then ukraine 183000 a month and a 3 million upfront payment for him and his friends think of this with no experience and no job and they said do you know energy
 it's an energy company that paid it
 do you know energy
 no i don't
 i've not familiar with the subject
 our great congressman
 right
 how the hell does this happen
 i think it will be brought up into debate
 i think it will be brought up in the debate i think
 where is hunter
 where is hunter
 you know where hunter is
 he's probably on the riviera having a very good time
 he's giving some great energy advice
 he's learning
 he's taking a night class on energy for 180 grand
 where is hunter
 they're corrupt
 remember joe with a prosecutor
  1 billion i'm not giving it to them until they get those prosecutors away from my son or whatever the hell he said that crazy company over in ukraine
 1 billion
 i'm not giving it
 you get them out
 and guess what
 they got them out
 here's your billion dollars
 now that's called quid pro quo
 right
 that's the real deal
 with us there was none
 they made it up
 remember when shift made the phony speech
 eight times he said the same thing except that's not what happened
 fortunately we had those wonderful people that write every perfect word every word
 i'm glad we had them because we're dealing with a bunch of thieving bad people
 so women and men ready
 would you rather have a woman on the supreme court or would you rather have a man
 ready
 a woman or a man
 so would you rather have me choose this is a very scientific poll
 actually it's a lot more accurate than these polls that interview like 97 people have been interviewed then they charge you a million dollars and they probably don't interview the people
 they sit behind their desk
 would you rather have a woman on the supreme court
 yes woman
 yes
 tom tiller says yes
 or would you rather have a man on the supreme court
 what's going on
 let's give it one more quick chance
 this is a free poll
 and this is a lot of people
 this is tens of thousands of people
 this is a lot of people
 you know the fake news they'll say he had a smattering of people
 if bernie sanders had a crowd
 oh he had a massive crowd
 it was so big
 with me my crowds are five times bigger than bernie's
 and they'll say he had a smattering of people
 they were in the middle of an airport that nobody ever heard of
 thousands
 if those people come on bring them over
 what the hell at this point might as well let them come on over
 come on over
 you got thousands of people behind these people
 i would imagine the sight lines aren't too good
 you have stands in front
 okay
 so one more time
 who would rather have a man on the supreme court
 who would have a woman on the supreme
 now tomorrow like fake news cnn he was playing games with the united states
 it is a terrible thing he's done
 no i'm just taking a poll please
 and by the way that's a very accurate poll because that's the way i feel
 it will be a woman a very talented very brilliant woman
 who i haven't chosen yet but we have numerous women on the list
 i built this incredible list of brilliant people
 and we're asking for biden's list
 he can't give it
 you know why
 because if he ever gave a list he'd either put somebody in the left middle which would be okay
 you could get votes or he'd put one somebody which is what he's going to choose so far left now if he did the left middle he loses his entire left coast
 right
 and if he loses the left coast that's the end of his election
 and last time remember how many people i got from bernie because of trade
 a lot of the bernie people vote for us because bernie is right about one thing trade
 but bernie took a bad defeat didn't he
 it was a bad loss
 he's one of the most gracious losers i've ever seen he is
 all elizabeth warren pocahontas had to do is leave
 if she left before super tuesday bernie would have won every one of those states but they split up that vote
 that's too bad but we have sleepy joe we'll see how that works out
 i think it's working out pretty good
 we were winning so much we didn't even have we could have called off the election
 we were winning by so much and then the plane came in from china
 and in many ways i had to go back to work but i had to go back to work on this one too
 and now we're going up and up and up and we're winning and we're winning all over the place
 because i happen to think i just say what i want
 and you know they make up a lot of false stories
 they will make up a lie
 like what i said about military
 can you imagine
 no animal would say that
 they make it up and then they put it in ads
 so once they did that the only good thing is i can say i said now i can say anything
 he is the worst candidate the dumbest of all candidates but he was dumb in prime time as told to me by a senator from long ago he said who's the dumbest in the senate who's the smartest in the senate
 the smartest is i won't tell you
 but the dumbest is joe
 i said who's joe
 he said joe biden
 that was 25 years ago
 that was in prime time
 he is the worst candidate in the history of presidential politics
 if i lose to him i don't know what i'm going to do
 i will never speak to you again
 you'll never see me again
 no how do you lose
 he is honestly i go up and these guys are grilling me all the time
 stephanopoulos grill grill
 okay
 it's all right
 it's okay
 i think it came out very well it's always it comes out well
 you have to be able to answer
 they're very weak compared to some of the foreign people that we deal with from foreign countries leaders of foreign countries
 but i say he's always using a teleprompter
 i don't care if he uses a teleprompter you know what bothers me
 that means the fake news is giving him the questions
 so that's what reallyâ€¦ they never gave me the questions
 if i ever said in fact i'm going to say it now
 i want from now on you to give me the questions before you ask me
 and i'm going to read the questions off the teleprompter and the questions are so easy
 did you see anderson cooper
 he's a nice guy
 he's interviewed me over the years a lot but he's a tough interviewer
 did you see those softballs
 what do you think donald trump is a very bad human being
 do you agree with that
 yes i do anderson
 i've never seen softballs and actually they're getting hit by it
 they're getting hit by it
 it's just a terrible thing
 i mean this is a guy i used to call him 1 joe because he ran numerous times and he could only get 1
 in fact he actually had 1 with an arrow pointing left
 that means less than one
 now he's shot he's got half of his head left and he's out think of it
 he's totally shot
 and he ends up getting the nomination
 he couldn't get it in prime time
 what the hell is going on with the world today
 what's going on
 what's going on with the world mark meadows
 unbelievable meadows oh boy
 he's a smart guy meadows great great guy north carolina in just three and a half years we obliterated the isis caliphate
 remember when i had it down to 99 they said you got to finish it
 i said let somebody else finish it
 and we went and we finished it
 we fixed our disastrous trade deals which we have
 china's now paying us billions and billions of dollars
 but you know i view it differently now i view china much differently now after the plague came in i view it differently
 and we brought your jobs back home to north carolina and our contract
 in three years of president trump real median household income rose by almost 7000
 now think of that three years three years right
 achieving the highest median income in the history of our country
 this is in three years
 under 16 years of presidents barack hussein obama ladies and gentlemen is president barack hussein obama or as rush limbaugh the great how great is rush
 do we love rush
 as rush limbaugh would say barack hussein obama
 you ever hear rush
 barack hussein obama
 rush is great
 he's doing well too
 he's great
 he's a tough guy
 we love rush
 we love you rush
 he watches every one of these rallies
 you know he supported me when i came down with our great first lady i came down the escalator
 i made a speech
 i didn't even have a speech writer i had to wing it
 the winging speeches are the best ones like last night
 but rush said i like that guy
 i'd never heard that before
 i'd never heard we're going to build a wall
 we're going to have secure borders
 we're going to make new trade deals that are like sane
 we're going to do all the things we're going to rebuild our military
 we're going to have a strong country again
 we did so many things and rush heard this
 i didn't know rush
 i mean maybe i met him once twice for two seconds
 and he became an instant fan of trump
 and he was for a long time before i even got to know him
 and he's been so important he's the king 39 million listeners
 there's nobody like him
 try sitting down for what is it
 three hours
 and talking just talking with everyone
 39 million people often
 try sitting
 we love rush
 i love rush
 but listen try sitting down with a radio show with millions and millions of people listening and talk for three hours without phone calls
 phone calls are easy
 hey what do you think of this
 what do you think
 just talk
 talk
 and everybody finds it fascinating
 and it is fascinating
 i wish i had time to listen more often
 it's a little tough as president but everybody finds it fascinating
 and we gave rush because he's such an important person and done such an incredible job the presidential medal of freedom
 and catherine his wife is great
 what a couple
 but rush has been unbelievable
 he's so on our side
 and he was from literally day one right from the beginning
 and we don't have to mention sean and laura and so many others
 we don't have to mention lou the great lou dobbs right
 i mean lou dobbs said lou started years ago and he liked us from the beginning
 he said donald trump is going to be a very good president
 okay
 that was the first little time
 then he went donald trump
 i love donald trump but he's the best since ronald reagan
 then he went donald trump is an even better president than ronald reagan
 so that was about a year and a half into it
 then the great lou dobbs said donald trump may be the greatest of all time
 greatest of all time
 and then somebody said can i ask you lou when you say the greatest does that include abraham lincoln and george washington
 he said absolutely
 he's now the greatest of all time
 so we love lou dobbs
 lou dobbs is great
 go out and buy his book
 his book is great
 but we have great support
 we have great support
 tucker's been very good lately i have to tell you
 tucker has been very good
 tucker carlson he's come a long way actually the whole thing with faking around with our whole history
 he's very strong in that we took care of that very powerfully very powerfully
 we signed an executive order
 we fired a lot of people that were talking about cancel culture and a lot of fake stuff that were getting paid a lot of money that we're here for a long time
 under 16 years of presidents obama and bush the median income only rose 2900
 now think of that
 so three years it went up 7000 16 years it went up less than 3000
 i'd say that's a big difference
 and that's not including energy because look what you're paying for your gasoline now
 right
 remember those days
 remember those days of 5 you said let's get rid of that big truck
 now you're all buying bigger trucks than they ever thought possible
 you know why
 because gasoline is so damn cheap right
 remember the 5 days
 now you're below 2 a lot right
 below two
 i mean they're seeing numbers that nobody believes
 it's all good stuff
 and we're energy independent
 so many things have happened
 if you add four or 5000 so you're talking about by 11000 you got to add the energy
 i said to my people put the energy in
 well i don't know if it's right
 i said do me a favor just put it in
 in my first three years we lifted 6
6 million people out of poverty the largest poverty reduction of any president in american history
 we built the greatest economy in the history of the world
 and now we're doing it again and we're doing it very rapidly
 this is a super v
 they said oh i don't know v is going to be very hard
 no this is a super v
 we will deliver a safe and effective vaccine this year
 it's already in very good shape
 very very good shape
 in a matter of weeks
 we will end the pandemic from china
 we will end our plague from china
 next year will be one of the greatest years in the history of our country it's heading that way
 if you take a look automobile manufacturing housing retailing they're all setting records they're through the roof hard to believe actually during the rounding the corner when i say rounding the corner they go crazy
 they want to keep it going as long as possible
 if you say anything positive they say he's not telling the truth to the american public
 i am actually telling the truth
 you know these people they talked about because i said well winston churchill was a great leader
 they said the other night you said winston churchill was a great leader but he didn't lie
 because this guy woodward
 he writes a book
 he's had it
 he's another one shot
 i compare him sort of to biden
 he's sharper than biden i have to say that but he's shot
 he's tired
 he's exhausted
 i never saw a guy be able to do so much television try doing a book on somebody else
 see how much television time they give you like none
 but they said the other night and it was amazing
 winston churchill
 they said he didn't lie to the people to britain
 he didn't lie
 i said well let me ask you this
 he stood on buildings when the nazis hitler were bombing london
 that's pretty brave because he may have been doing a little drinking but he was known for that right
 he's got a right to but it's true
 he stood in the buildings in london as they were bombing london and made speeches and made statements and had everything
 and he'd sometimes have press conferences
 and the fake news wouldn't show up
 he was standing there nobody was in front of him
 but he would stand there and he would say you are safe
 you are safe
 everything is okay
 you are safe
 well that's a lie i guess right
 so i said oh i never thought of it that way
 i guess he lied
 no he's a great leader and he was leading and he was a great great prime minister
 he did a fantastic job
 not lying
 no
 we love our country we want to lead our country and we can't let a thing like this this is a horrible horrible thing that happened to the world it happened should have been stopped in china
 they stopped it from going into the rest of china should have been stopped in china
 to defeat the china virus we launched the largest industrial mobilization since world war ii
 somebody said what grade would you give yourself
 i said a+
 but i would give myself a d i would say i would give myself and my whole group because mike pence is great mike pence really was
 he worked so hard
 and it's unfair he worked so hard
 the ventilators the vaccines the therapeutics now we have look at what's happening
 when somebody gets very sick look how we bring them back so often compared to what it was originally
 i mean the work that's been done and wait until you see what happens over the next few weeks with what's going on
 but the democrats don't want the vaccine
 they don't want it
 at first they wanted a vaccine because they didn't think it could happen
 now that we have it they're going like well we don't want it
 it's the craziest thing
 think of it you want to get a vaccine and they're willing to hurt people let people die for political reasons
 think of it
 i think honestly i think it's a disgrace
 but we surged rapid testing kits
 we have more testing than all other i mean practically everybody
 you look at number two is india
 they have 1
5 billion people
 we are up 50 million tests more than india
 in fact we're about to crack 100 million tests
 and when you test then you have does this make sense
 then you have cases
 so we do all this testing and i come home and i turn on nbc news
 it is so bad
 i think nbc that's not only msdnc
 i think nbc with lester holt
 there's another beauty
 hi lester
 how do you feel big in second place lester
 he surged from first place to second place
 but nbc news is so i mean it's just terrible
 they use free airwaves and then they give you fake news
 free airwaves
 they should pay a lot of money for this
 this is not right
 nbc
 it's owned by a company called concast c-o-n concast they're con they're con men
 it's a disgrace
 they spend fortunes on public relations and then i get up and make a speech like this with television blazing all over the world i guess
 yeah the world it's all over the world
 and i say concast and immediately there goes their public how's your public relations doing nbc
 not too good
 but they're justâ€¦ they don't tell the truth
 our country would be so much better off if we had honest media really
 really would
 and do you see what their approval rating has gone to
 i think it's one of my greatest achievements
 hey look- it's a saturday night
 we have all night
 this happened last night in minnesota
 i have these teleprompter people they're great they're genius
 and i was about 45 minutes into the speech and i realized i was only on line two
 and he was like what do i do
 but we have more fun
 hey you now have a president that doesn't have to use a teleprompter isn't that nice
 and i said last night i said and yeah your friends were there
 the congressmen
 by the way is the media now and i'm pretty sure it's getting close
 i think they have a lower approval rating than congress
 congratulations
 no but it's hard
 when you're sitting there you're in businesses you're in construction you drive trucks you do a lot of things
 you're in offices
 you don't realize because you don't know what's happening
 i know exactly a true story
 and then it's written to totally bend the truth to make a good thing into a bad thing
 like can you believe it in one week they nominated me not for one but for two nobel prizes
 no but think of it
 no but think
 and they didn't cover the story
 now obama got his the first week
 very liberal group and nobody knew what the hell he got it for and he didn't know
 why did you get it
 i don't know
 remember
 i don't know
 i have no idea
 but you know you have a president you love your president and your president gets honored because i'm not being honored you're being honored with the nobel peace prize for israel what we did with israel
 i went home and i said to the first lady darling she's very popular
 she made a great speech right
 and ivanka made a great speech right
 but i went home
 i said darling i have big news tonight
 let's turn on the television
 you know we don't use wind
 we use actually we actually use petroleum
 we use petro
 because we like it to be on like a lot
 we don't like to have lots of open gaps when the wind's not blowing
 we can't watch president trump
 i go home
 i say first lady a great thing happened today
 i was honored nobel peace prize nominated
 this is a big thing first lady
 and then i went home two days later
 i said first lady you're not going to believe it
 i was honored again
 nobel prize that's kosovo
 israel kosovo
 i said first lady this is great news
 let's turn on the television
 this is going to be big
 this is going to be big tonight
 we just got honored this is big
 nobel peace can you imagine
 you grow up in brooklyn queens and now you're getting theâ€¦ first lady let's turn on the television
 let's turn onto that fake nbc news
 and i see we have a storm
 okay first lady don't worry about it
 the storm is big
 we have it taken care of fema's down there florida alabama georgia
 we got fema down there
 it's being taken care of
 we always take care of it
 we take good care of it
 texas louisiana
 we took good care of him two weeks ago
 all right first lady don't worry about it
 it's the next story i'm sure it's the nobel prize for peace
 we're stopping mass killings between kosovo and serbia
 they've been killing each other for so many they're going to stop killing
 i said fellas let's get together
 they'd been doing it for hundreds of years frankly under different names
 i said that's great
 and with israel uae and bahrain signed a deal with israel
 everybody said it couldn't be done
 i said all right first lady that's the first story on nbc but don't worry
 that's a big story
 the floods are big
 i see it
 and then there was a second story about something
 and then their third story is about something with me i don't know something bad they found out
 then there was a fourth and a fifth and a sixth
 i said first lady i'm a little embarrassed
 i thought we'd do a little better
 and then they looked at the screen and said good night
 and i wasn't covered
 i got the nobel peace prize nomination a peace prize nobel nomination
 and they didn't cover it
 and then the following day i watched a certain show that does like us and they said would you believe that they covered and they mentioned like five subjects that were nothing
 that was 18 minutes
 and the peace prize nobel version zero time for president trump
 thank you very much fake news media we appreciate it
 and when obama got it here are the headlines
 president obama gets the nobel prize
 we need an honest media
 the free airwaves they lie over the free airwaves
 they use them and they lie
 i don't know
 we're going to have to look at it
 they're a bunch of scoundrels
 they hate it when i say it but you know honestly they are the enemy of the people
 when they lie they are the enemy of the people
 you are the enemy of the people
 oh damn it
 the red lights just went off
 one two three there's one back there there's one back there probably oh it's oan thank you oan
 every time i get on this subject they cover me not because they want to but we get great ratings
 we get ratings
 these little deals that we have here come on in folks come on in
 look at these people
 but you know what
 i'll tell you what it's true
 they cover it becauseâ€¦ but anytime i start talking about the fake news media you see them getting a little tentative
 the camera starts to shake a little bit and you know there's another thing
 look at this crowd
 it's as far as the eye can see it's a big crowd right
 they never cover it
 i said to my wife last night we had this incredible crowd
 a lot of people thousands and thousands
 i mean like 25 30000 many people outside couldn't get it
 it was like a sea of people
 my wife said was it a large crowd
 i said did you watch
 yes
 but they only show your face
 and i saw people they never show
 and that includes fox which has changed a lot changed a lot sad
 somebody said what's the biggest difference between 2016 and now
 you know what i said fox
 biggest difference
 biggest difference
 i don't know what's going on with them
 but we have some great ones too on fox
 we surged rapid testing kits to every nursing home in america
 we learned a lot through pioneering therapies we reduced the fatality rate by 85 since april
 think of that
 85
 we've come up with things
 they're waiting to see what's coming over the next few months in terms of therapeutics which to me is even more important than the vaccine
 you go into the hospital you make people better
 you give them a shot you do a transfusion
 you make people better
 they walk out that's to me even better but ultimately long-term those vaccines are going to be great and they're really working out well and it's going to be really soon
 the people in certain groups are trying to hold them up as long as possible as long as possible
 they're going to try and give sleepy joe the credit
 he doesn't even know what aâ€¦ it's possible
 they're going to try and get sleepy joe the credit
 he doesn't even know what a vaccine is
 europe is almost 30 higher excess mortality than the united states
 does anyone know that
 they don't report that right
 europe
 europe's had a hard time
 i'm not looking to hurt them but they have 30 higher
 our bold and early action saved millions of lives and our decisive economic response saved tens of millions of jobs including 1
3 million jobs and a wonderful place called north carolina right
 when i banned travel from china in january sleepy joe biden called it that's hysterical
 that's xenophobic
 what does that mean
 tell me what xenophobic means sleepy joe
 who said that
 i mean you're my friend
 who said it
 all right what a voice
 have you ever tried opera
 what a voice did everybody hear that
 that's true
 i wouldn't say it
 she said he has no idea where he is
 but i would never say it
 i won't say it
 i won't say it
 i refuse this
 no but don't underestimate him
 look he's been doing this for 47 years and i got a debate coming up with this guy
 no it's true
 you never know you never know
 they give him a big fat shot in the ass and he comes out and for two hours he's better than ever before
 problem is what happens after the â€¦ no we're going to ask for a drug test we are
 i'd like to have a drug test
 both of us
 i'll take it he'll take
 because i watched him into debates with all those people those democrats
 the one who treated him worst was kamala
 actually also she was the one that treated you know that she was the one that treated him so badly
 and she treated kavanaugh very badly too
 nobody was ever ruder nobody ever suffered like justice kavanaugh suffered in the hands and the mouths of those horrible people
 the way he was tortured was disgraced
 and they had nothing
 those women that was all made up
 most of them have already admitted it was all made up lies false accusations and they made him suffer
 and the leader of the pack i would say was kamala was the worst and pocahontas was a close second
 how's pocahontas doing since she destroyed bloomberg
 how about bloomberg
 did he get killed
 now he's trying to come back
 he's trying to buy his way back into the democratic party
 i'm going to put up 100 million in florida we're going to go he wants to be back so badly
 here's a guy who spent 2 billion it's almost two billion now they're finding out
 he had some of the dumbest advisers people i know some of the dumbest people
 if he would have just kept spending a couple of hundred million dollars a week on ads he could have won
 he could have won
 unfortunately he said no i want to debate
 he went and sued to get into the debates
 that was not a good lawsuit
 they settled by saying we'll let you in the debate
 the first question he was destroyed
 you would think that the way the democrats treated him he would really come to me and he'd say i want you but his hatred and jealousy â€¦ he wanted to be president but he doesn't have the capability of being president
 but he's going down now to florida he's going to spend 100 million
 how good â€¦ i have to say this i'm not a fan of elizabeth warren
 i gave her the name pocahontas i thought that was the end
 remember what i used to say about her
 she has â€¦ oh well you know it
 you know
 i would just look i said this is not an indian
 she said i'm an indian
 you remember what i said
 i have more indian blood than me i have more in me than she has and i have none
 unfortunately i'd like to have some
 i would like to have some
 i think it could help it might make me better but i have none
 and i said i have more than she does
 and then she went out to and she choked remember that
 she went out and she took a test
 and it found out that about 700 years ago there was a possible event 1024th right
 wasn't that it
 good memory very good memory
 trump has a good memory
 good moment
 not for that but for a lot of things
 now 1024th which meant many many many centuries ago there could have been a hookup somewhere along the line
 but she choked
 we forced her into a choke
 she went down like a rock and then she started coming up up up up up
 then she totally destroyed mike bloomberg
 we call him mini mike
 remember
 mini mikey wants that platform
 i want a platform damn it
 i don't mind
 oh boy he was pathetic but now he's going to try and buy his way back into the democrat party
 you remember that guy
 great environmentalist
 except he made his money with coal which is okay i think coal is good
 clean coal i like clean coal
 if we had listened to joe biden hundreds of thousands more americans would have died
 you know that
 he was way behind
 this was months later
 and then i watch him last night reading something saying that i opened i closed it up one week later one week
 two months later he was talking about the fact that i shouldn't be doing that to china
 i shouldn't be banning china because i was xenophobic
 and it's just unbelievable
 and now they will say anything
 it's called disinformation
 they will make up a lie they will make up a story and they go with it it makes no difference whether or not it's show and they'll take ads
 it's the worst group of people
 he's surrounded by bad people dishonest people but they're very smart
 he's not smart
 they keep him from talking
 it's actually if he wins it's the single most brilliant campaign in the history of the world
 because they took a man who's got nothing
 he didn't have it but he's got nothing and i will give them credit
 the single greatest campaign in history if he wins but you know what
 if he wins north carolina is screwed and so is every place else
 and you can forget your tobacco industry you can forget your farmers
 i gave the farmers 28 billion
 thank you very much presidency
 28 billion
 because you were targeted right
 you were targeted by china
 and i said how much were the farmers iowa nebraska you all of them
 you were targeted
 i said how much
 sonny perdue i said how much secretary
 12 billion then 16 billion you were targeted
 i took it out of the tariffs we charge
 we never took 25 cents in from china now we're getting billions and billions and billions of dollars
 sleepy joe that never gave never took anything or trump misjudging him
 so mexico we're driving them a little crazy
 they don't like trump too much
 but now biden is recklessly campaigning against his vaccine
 his campaign campaign's really reckless
 and all it is is for political reasons
 it's political reasons
 biden his whole deal is catastrophic shutdown
 we're getting better we're really coming along and he's talking about shutting down
 we're not doing any shutdowns
 we don't need shutdowns
 maybe a little area if it's such a spike we understand we have to take care of our senior citizens
 this guy talked he said well i'll do whatever my medical people want
 i believe in science
 he doesn't know what science is
 i believe in science
 no we're not doing any shutdowns
 we don't need we're rounding the turn
 without the vaccine we're rounding the turn
 with the vaccine it'll just speed it up
 that's another one that will be controversial
 they'll say he's saying that it's happened
 yeah without the care without the vaccine it's going along
 with a vaccine even better
 it'll be faster
 biden's own chief of staff said when they manage the h1n1 that he calls the n1h1 right
 he goes the n1h1 and that's an easy one because h comes before but he always gets it wrong
 it's like seven times it's great to be with the great people of iowa
 they'll say sir you're in idaho
 oh
 i've never made that mistake so far
 but i always say if you do just leave the stage because you can never recover
 you can speak as well as i mentioned winston churchill even though he was a great speaker he was a stutterer and he became one of the greatest speakers ever
 you could be winston churchill if you make that mistake just leave the stage
 you can't recover
 but he's made it oftentimes right in new hampshire and it was vermont
 the worst i think i think there was one he was in ohio and he said he was in florida right
 but he couldn't find any palm trees
 we just got a poll from ohio
 through the roof
 great state of ohio good governor great state of ohio
 but when they managed the h1n1 swine flu this was from his top person that ran it
 we did every possible thing wrong
 60 million americans got h1n1 in that period of time
 and it was just a total disaster
 he basically said we didn't know what the hell we were doing
 and this is the guy that's going to tell us what to do with something that's much more lethal much more lethal
 this is much more lethal than the swine flu
 if h1n1 had the same fatality rate as the china virus over two million people would have already perished
 they didn't know what the hell they were doing
 and the guy admitted it
 that guy can not be very popular in democrat politics right there
 but just to remember and he's telling us how to do things
 we're building ventilators we're the ventilator capital of the world now think of it
 we're sending them to other countries we have so many
 and we have made a lot of governors look very good
 and they all admit it until the press comes in front where they say oh he was okay but we took care of them
 we took care of governors we took care of the states
 on november 3rd north carolina will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity or whether we allow joe biden to impose a 4 trillion tax hike ban american energy confiscate your guns
 these are all things that he said
 shut down our economy destroy the suburbs
 they were saying that women in the suburbs they're not sure if they like me
 they're starting to like me a lot lately because it's law and order
 they want law and order
 thank you
 a suburbanite thank you thank you
 no it's true
 i don't know
 but i heard the same thing four years ago remember
  women will not vote for him
 then we win the election it's like they're all in shock
 well what took place
 well he did very well with women what the hell was that all about right
 did very well
 women were great
 now if it holds true â€¦ there a lot of jobs a lot of jobs a lot of great thinking but he wants to give free healthcare to illegal aliens
 now what that's going to do is destroy our country because two things happen
 number one we can't afford it
 number two everybody is going to come pouring into our country if you do that
 right now they're saying wherever they are when you say we're going to give you free education we're going to give you free healthcare
 we're going to take care of you
 everything's going to be perfect
 we're going to give you every single family now watch they'll print this
 we've checked it out and he lied about this
 every single family is going to be given a brand new silver cloud rolls royce
 now i said that and cnn went he lied about the fact that they're not getting a rolls royce
 remember what i said
  russia if you're listening in front of this message russia if you're listening find out where her e-mails or whatever
 and then everybody laughed i laughed
 well they actually play it all the time
 when he spoke to russia
 do you ever see it
 and they cut it off before the end they don't see any i said russia if you're listening â€¦ oh these people are sick
 he wants to erase your borders
 yeah that was supposed to be a joke right
 it was a joke
 it was a joke everybody was laughing but they refused to go that extra quarter of a second
 he wants to indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-american lies in education
 to combat the toxic left wing propaganda in our schools i am launching a new pro-american lesson plan for students called 1776 commission
 it's already done
 that's good
 and it's true your kids come home and they tell you things
 how many of you the kids come home and they tell you things
 it's a disgrace what they're teaching them it's a disgrace
 we're ending it
 in fact we're taking school funds away from these crazy schools that are teaching horrible things bad things actually
 we will teach our children the truth about america that we are the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth
 and we are getting better every single day
 and no party can lead america that will not teach our children to love america
 no party can do that
 the sleepy campaign has joined forces with those trying to tear down america and our way of life
 we have a great way of life and getting better all the time
 look at what we've done
 biden's running mate urged supporters to help bail rioters out of jail including one who attempted murder
 that's right
 one who attempted to murder a police officer and a man accused of sexually assaulting an eight-year-old girl 13 members of biden's staff donated to the same fund
 look that's where they're coming from just so you know
 he's trying to go a little bit more right like the fracking
 oh well of course we're going to have â€¦ for six months he's saying there'll be no fracking which i don't think the people in pennsylvania thrilled with do you agree considering that your taxes could quadruple
 i tell it all the time texas right
 texas they like oil
 they like guns right in texas
 right
 and they like god
 so he comes out with a platform no oil
 we don't want oil
 this is during the democrat deal
 there'll be no oil there'll be no god there'll be no guns
 this is not a good campaign
 and then the fake news says donald trump is tied in texas
 i'm tied
 last time i was tied in texas until the day of the vote
 then they announced the second they called it the polls in texas have closed
 donald trump has won the state of texas
 think of it
 he's against oil
 he's against guns
 they're going to confiscate your guns second amendment's going to be destroyed
 i am holding up your second amendment
 if it's not me look what i've done
 you think it's been easy
 they want to get rid of the second amendment
 they're going to get rid of the guns right
 and religion
 so look what they're doing to religion
 these states everything's closed except you're allowed to protest
 that's why i say everything we do is a protest
 look at all those people back there look at that
 look it they just form
 wow
 turn the cameras around please
 they never do it
 turn the cameras around please
 wow
 thank you
 that's a lot of people
 we're proud of you
 that's a lot of people
 you ever notice they never do it though
 i say turn the camera
 right from the beginning they never did
 they don't want to give us the credit for these big crowds because you know what
 when you see crowds like this or in wisconsin that i had a few nights ago or last night was so incredible
 what we had last night was just incredible in minnesota
 we're going to win it 1972 we're going to win it
 1972 it hasn't â€¦ that's a long time ago
 remember
 i think reagan won every state except for minnesota
 we're going to win minnesota
 what we've done for them we've opened up their livelihood again
 maine
 how about maine
 i opened up 5000 square miles of ocean
 obama closed it
 they said why
 he had no idea
 right off their shore no fishing no nothing
 they called it a monument right
 right off their shore
 maine i mean if i don't win maine â€¦ maine traditionally is not really very republican but i won maine too last time actually
 because i love maine too
 i love maine too
 but think of what i did
 i opened the waters up for fishermen and for lobster men and women
 now they go lobster fishing and fishing
 but 5 000 i said why did they close it
 nobody was able to tell me but i opened it up an executive order
 i totally opened it up
 i did many other things
 then i got the tariffs
 they couldn't do business in european union they couldn't do business in china because they were charging tariffs to maine
 so canada would take our fish and lobster
 we'd sell it to canada for nothing and they'd sell it to china and europe because they didn't have to pay tariffs
 not only did i get the 5000 â€¦ think of what 5000 square miles
 so you take one mile square mile multiply times 5000
 that's a big area even in an ocean right
 it's massive
 and it was the best area the best
 i got rid of the tariffs
 i told them if you tariff our maine lobster people and fishermen and women if you want a tariff on them that's okay but we're going to tariff your cars okay
 which is a much bigger deal
 it was amazing how quickly those tariffs were taken off
 i did that off of maine i did that in two weeks okay
 took me two weeks
 once i found out about it it's hard to believe it ever happened
 so i did that for maine
 and somebody said i'm down in maine
 how the hell can i be down in maine after what i did
 i'll tell you what if i do that from maine and if maine doesn't vote for trump
 i don't think i'm going back okay
 i can tell you one thing
 their senator never did it for them
 joe biden and the democrats want to gut police departments nationwide
 you know that right
 here in north carolina nearly 50 democrat state house members and candidates have signed a pledge to slash police funding endangering your families
 i was recently honored to be endorsed by 54 sheriffs throughout this state and we're joined by many of them tonight
 where are they
 thank you sheriff
 thank you
 thank you
 thank you folks
 thank you
 thank you
 you got to take care of our law enforcement
 we got to take care nobody can do the job like them
 we have to let them do their job
 we've got to stop this nonsense this child's play we've got to stop they're great
 you know i was endorsed by think of this new york's finest
 it's very tough
 you know de blasio's your mayor he doesn't have a clue what's happening either
 i think sleepy joe's worse do you want to know the truth
 because this other guy has just an ideology that's just terrible
 but de blasio is there and new york's finest first time they've ever endorsed a presidential candidate they endorsed me three weeks ago
 that takes courage
 think of it
 chicago the police in chicago they could do their job
 we don't even have to bring in the national guard
 whenever we do it takes about 30 minutes it's over right
 like we did in minneapolis 30 minutes
 remember that beautiful scene
 they lined up they went down there was no social distancing in between these great tough guys
 there was no social distancing tom tillis
 they went down and they had 250000 outfits
 they had more crap on that helmet with night goggles
 and these guys were sort of wise guys right
 they were shouting at them screaming at them
 they were screaming at the wrong people
 they went down they never had to stop
 it was just forward
 it all ended
 it all ended in minneapolis
 it took you also had what
 a half an hour
 remember they hit the cnn reporter in the knee
 he went down ali velshi
 he said this is a friendly protest
 it's wonderful to see such a â€¦ behind him it was all fire for a block
 it looked like berlin during the war
 this is a friendly â€¦ what are they doing
 how does that help to be like that
 how does that help
 we're joined tonight by some really great friends of mine and some warriors that have been a fantastic help to me
 one man who especially over the last year he has been so great he couldn't be better
 and i think he's doing very well
 i'm looking at some numbers and you're doing very well
 and i think your opponent has some very big problems
 senator tom tillis
 thank you tom
 thank you
 he's been great smart guy
 and he's got a couple of bills that he's putting in one in particular i love it
 you got to do it
 that if a sanctuary city causes problems you can sue the sanctuary city you can sue
 will you get we got to get that one moving right
 that's moving along right
 that's a great one
 a man who i just did a phone call for the other night and the people love him
 he's in a rough district but he's now leading
 i see you're up in the polls congressman richard hudson great guy
 where's richard

 and you know what we've done
 many many car plants are now opening up
 a great gentleman who's just retiring prime minister abe of japan
 i said shinzo please do me a favor

 i said shinzo you have to do it
 next day it was a story five car companies to open up in michigan right
 so much for free enterprise but he's a great guy he's a friend of mine

 they're lucky he's a friend of mine
 i would have been much tougher
 it's hard
 when a guy is a friend it's hard but they did a lot
 they did a lot
 they helped it a lot
 and what they've done here by the way japan and what they've done in michigan ohio what they've done
 by the way we all love south carolina right right
 i think we love it

 really good
 okay
 in everything we do we're putting america first unlike other administrations and not just obama and biden
 this has gone on for many years
 we put america first and that's what we're doing
 and you know what
 other countries for the first time in decades respect us again
 remember that
 they respect us again
 you know all about data 28 countries
 we had six countries that were current and the amount of current is too low okay
 six countries
 i went in and i said you got to pay
 sorry you're delinquent
 they said really
 yeah i said
 you're delinquent
 you got to pay
 obama would go and make a speech and leave that would be it
 we were paying for it
 we're protecting europe and they're screwing us on trade
 so we protect them and they're screwing us on trade
 no good no good
 can't do it
 i said it's unfair
 and the secretary general stoltenberg of nato said i've never seen and the fake news can call him up and check
 he said he's the greatest that we've ever seen
 for 20 years the spending at nato went like this right
 and america we pick it up
 every time it goes down they didn't pay
 and i said we're supposed to protect you
 you're going to be attacked by russia or somebody we're supposed to protect you
 and yet you're delinquent
 you don't pay your bills
 and that includes germany
 they're paying 1 they're supposed to pay two and 2 is way too low
 2 military spending
 so we got listen to this
 it never gets reported by these fakers
 we got 130 million more more not total more going to over three years 400 billion
 so we're going from 130 billion with a b not million to 400 billion
 and they said to me they said â€¦ and they said to me they said to me very nice guy head of one of the countries at a table
 i can't believe it never got released but now we can talk about it because it's three years ago
 but they said sir â€¦  and this was a big private meeting of all of the nations does that mean if we don't â€¦  because i said you got to pay your bills
 we're protecting you
 you're not paying your bills
 some did like poland and some others but most didn't
 six to eight were current and we were paying much more than we should have been paying much more
 i mean it's europe
 we got to defend ourself and there was no guarantee that they'd help us if we ever had a problem
 right
 we're never going to have a problem
 we got so much stuff now
 we were depleted
 now we have great â€¦ but they said to me does this mean â€¦  and i had to give this answer
 i can't believe it didn't get leaked by some sleazebag
 we have leakers all over this place but a lot of it didn't leak
 a lot of it is just made up by the newspapers
 they make up phony stories
 they say donald trump woke up today
 he was in a very bad mood according to sources
 there is no source
 they just made it up
 hey i woke up and i was in a bad mood
 true
 i've actually had a â€¦ i've been in a good mood because we're doing so much for our country
 we've done so much for our country
 but at the nato meeting one of the presidents of one of the good countries all good they said sir does this mean that if we don't pay does this mean that you're going to leave and you're not going to protect us
 i said yes
 that's what it means
 i'm sorry
 it was an amazing effect because other presidents said no
 we will always protect you
 we will always protect you even if you don't pay even if our taxpayer is paying for everything even though you take advantage of us on trade you don't let our cars in you don't let our stuff in but you sell us like crazy even though you tariff our product even though you do everything and then you take advantage of us with the military
 they said we will always protect you
 so they didn't pay
 why the hell would they pay
 they said boy these guys are stupid
 so they asked me the question does this mean sir that you will not protect us anymore if we don't pay
 i said i'm sorry to say it does
 that's a big story
 three years ago it's a big story
 it was amazing how the money came in
 so we took in 130 billion a year going over a three-year period to 400 just because i asked
 right
 just because i asked
 true
 they don't report that story
 then we got lightweights that i fired and they write books about me that i'm a bad guy oh he's a terrible guy
 he treats our allies so badly
 no
 our allies treat us badly
 our allies in many ways treat us worse than our enemies
 i must be honest with you
 they take advantage of us
 everyone takes advantage of your country and we don't put up with it
 and you know what the funny thing
 we get along better now because they respect us again
 before they thought we were stupid
 they respect us again
 they do
 i mean look at israel look what we did
 i saw kerry this other day
 is this guy the worst negotiator
 gave iran 150 billion plus 1
8 billion in cash
 he never walked
 sometimes in a negotiation when you've given everything and you can't give anymore and then they want more you get up ane walk
 remember the bicycle accident
 that was the only time he had to ride his bicycle in a race
 73 years old
 i promise i said i will never ever â€¦ i promise to you ride a bicycle in a race or any other time frankly
 i will never ride a bicycle during a negotiation
 and he broke his leg and his arm and he was all screwed up
 and that was actually a good thing because it delayed the signing of that horrible deal which i terminated
 nah we had some terrible negotiators and they all said i saw them the other day this was him like a year ago mark my words you will never ever sign deals with arab countries with israel
 it can't be done
 well we just signed the two great ones and we got about seven more that want to come in
 what a bunch what a bunch
 and then they say bad things about your president
 they don't like my foreign policy
 i like my foreign policy
 you like it
 no we were taken advantage of by the whole world
 they're so stupid so stupid
 we've spent the last four years reversing the damage that biden and his crew inflicted on us over a 47-year period
 joe biden is weak
 he's supported every globalist sellout of north carolina the workers what he's done
 and when i say him it's him and people in his little group that â€¦ you've achieved so much over a period of time
 he sold it out
 look at nafta
 how bad was nafta
 china's entry into the world trade organization
 tpp would have destroyed our car industry
 and of course he joined and wanted to join the paris climate accord
 that's another beauty
 that would have cost you trillions and trillions of dollars
 that was actually i think designed to put us out of business literally
 biden has repeatedly surrendered your jobs to china and other countries
 this state lost 43 of all manufacturing jobs after the nafta and china disasters
 you know that
 you lost 43 but i think the real number is 61 by the way
 biden says that this an election between scranton and park avenue
 by the way he left scranton
 he likes to say i was born in pennsylvania
 but he doesn't say he left
 his father left
 not his fault but they make it like he's â€¦ no he went to delaware
 he doesn't leave delaware that i can tell you
 every time i see this guy â€¦ wilmington delaware
 does he ever leave
 i'm in los angeles
 i'm trying to work on the fires
 they ought to do some forest management a little bit maybe
 ridiculous
 the floors of the forest it's got 20 years of leaves and trees that are dry as a bone matchsticks
 forest management
 naturally this is an election not between scranton or wherever it is
 it's really between scranton and china you know that scranton and china
 i'm with america
 biden is with china
 if biden wins china wins
 if we win america wins north carolina wins pennsylvania wins and the american workers win in every single state
 to save our auto industry i withdrew from this horrible horrible deal trans-pacific partnership
 earlier this year i kept my promise to north carolina when i ended the nafta nightmare
 you got hit so hard
 all those empty buildings all over the place but a lot of them now are filled up because of us
 they filled up
 when did they fill up
 over the last three-and-a-half years
 i proudly signed a brand new us-mexico-canada agreement into law which will bring hundreds of thousands of high paying jobs back to the united states and it's already doing
 we invested 2
5 trillion in the us military
 defense spending in north carolina has soared by more than 1 billion a year
 congratulations good job
 we launched the first new branch of the us armed forces
 this by itself would be a big achievement
 this is one of so many different things right to try the military the vets everything
 we've done so much but we â€¦ 75 years right
 last one was the air force
 the army the navy the air force the marines the coast guard they're so good
 we have another one now for 75 years space force
 we need it
 i never even promised that
 right
 one of them said recently that he's actually done more than he promised in the campaign
 that means i'm probably the only politician in history
 they will tell you these incredible women up here from north carolina
 stand up
 will you please
 these are most incredible people
 thank you
 stand up
 turn around for the cameras so they can see how incredible you are
 thank you
 man oh man
 what a life
 but we took care of the va with veterans choice
 you saw that
 what obama was nothing
 it wasn't working the mission act
 that's amazing
 and accountability where we can fire people in the va that aren't taking great care of our vets okay
 you're fired
 get out
 you're fired
 out
 we killed the founder and leader of isis al-baghdad
 we took out the worlds number-one terrorist and the mass murder of american troops and many others qasem soleimani
 he's dead
 he's dead
 i withdrew from last administration's disastrous iran nuclear deal
 i kept my promise recognized the true capitol of israel and opened the american embassy in jerusalem
 and we got it built
 i was signing a sheet of paper you've heard this story 1
1 billion
 i said what's this for
 they said sir now that you've moved we're going to build an embassy in israel in jerusalem
 i say how much is it
 1
1 billion
 you got some friends of mine here they're builders
 you don't spend 1
1 billion on a one-story building
 i don't know what's going on
 so i said so does it have to cost so much
 yes sir
 we're buying land so i called david friedman
 he's our ambassador he's one of the most successful lawyers in new york
 he's a brilliant guy
 he loves israel
 right
 love israel
 i call him
 he's the ambassador he's there
 i said david they want to spend 1
1 billion on a damn one-story embassy
 it's crazy
 i said would you take a look
 maybe we own some land
 we own a lot of land
 we've been there a long time
 calls me back
 he said let me take a look at it sir
 he calls me the next day
 sir we have a great piece of land a much better location that we were going to way overpay for a much bigger piece
 we have a setback building that we can renovate and make it great
 i said that's fantastic david
 how much will it cost to renovate the building
 i think we can do it for 190000
 so i said david it's the first time i've ever done it
 i said david it's too cheap
 you got to spend more than that
 so a friend of mine ron baron he's got an office building and he's got jerusalem stone facing the elevators in this high-rise building jerusalem stone
 and every time i go in he goes oh you got to see jerusalem stone
 and he paid a fortune for it
 he's so proud of it
 he doesn't talk about anything but his jerusalem stone
 i said david do me a favor
 you're i jerusalem
 right
 yes
 do they have jerusalem stone
 they got so much we don't know what to do with it
 i said use all jerusalem stone when you're rebuilding the building when you do your renovation
 everything wrap it in jerusalem stone
 so i think we ended up spending to fix up the building like 500000
 can you believe it
 we were going to spend 1
1 billion and by the way it would never get built
 it wouldn't be built in 20 years from now
 and they like it so much they gave up the plan
 they think this is better
 it's a better location it's probably a better building
 but i could tell you stories like that all night long the aircraft carriers that cost 10 times more than they should cost and then they use the electric catapults
 you've heard that
 right
 they don't want to use steam
 why
 because it's too simple because it works because it's better
 so they go to electric catapults that they're working on for years now
 elevators that are operated my magnets instead of hydraulic
 magnets
 it sounds good
 trust me it doesn't work
 one little glass of water
 we're in the ocean
 one little glass of water boom those magnets are gone
 i could have told them that
 i actually asked the architect  have you ever built a ship before
 it's unbelievable
 you heard the story last night about air force one
 it saved a lot of money
 i said to boeing no
 it's got to have a three in front of it
 they were going to buy air force one 5
7 billion
 it's a lot of money but look it's a helluva a deal
 it's a helluva a plane
 what can i tell you
 i said how much is the new plane
 it was signed by obama
 5
7 billion sir
 i said that's a lot of money
 it's actually two planes
 air force one is two planes
 i'll give you a little
 they're going to say that's classified information
 well they've been flying around with two planes for 30 years so i assume somebody knows
 and our air force one is 31 years old
 right
 so look it's time
 a lot of the arab sheiks come in
 i see their plane
 they have a brand new one
 i say what do we have
 31 years and we're protecting them
 why the hell don't we have a new one
 so they finally had at 31 years old
 the new one is totally different 747
 it's much longer bigger wingspan much more beautiful
 it's modern it's beautiful
 5
7 billion
 so i said to the head of boeing nice guy dennis this was before they had their difficulty which is terrible what happened to them but i said to him dennis i'm not going to spend 5
7 billion on a plane
 i'm not going to do it
 i won't do it
 it's too much
 i said last night i told this story first time i said it's got to have a three on it
 he said we can't do it
 no
 he called me up the following day we'll take 200 million off
 somebody said well what are you losing
 i said nothing
 in fact we're gaining a generator
 and i said you got to build an extra generator
 he said we'll take 200 million off
 i said nope
 i said to the general in charge i said general can we break the deal
 yes sir we can
 we have a cancellation clause
 good
 general execute your cancellation clause
 we're not going to buy it
 i'm not going to pay 5
7 billion for air force one
 i'm not doing it
 he said yes sir
 i'm very proud of this clause
 why
 why
 because we have the right to cancel
 well do we have to pay anything
 yes sir 250 million
 i said general don't cancel it
 take it back
 just tell them we don't like the plane
 okay
 and i couldn't even say i'm going to buy it from europe
 the only competitor is europe
 i can't say we'll buy it from europe
 no that doesn't work out to well
 so i said don't do it
 i don't want to send them a check
 250 million for nothing
 right
 we don't want to do it
 so i said just tell them we don't like it
 the price is too high
 we're not going to buy it
 but don't send anything don't put it in writing
 please general
 yes sir
 thank you
 so about a week later the head of boeing called me up
 he said look we can get it down but you're asking for too much
 i said you don't understand
 it has to have a three on it not a four but three
 so another months goes by
 i forgot about it
 i get a call from boeing would 3
9 billion be okay
 i said yes that's okay
 it's got a three on it
 true
 true story
 true story and then somebody said â€¦ it's true though somebody said well it must be a different plane
 yeah
 i said yeah we have a much nicer paint job
 we have a much nicer paint job you know that and it actually got an extra generator put on
 okay
 so it's actually more
 they said well we could use an extra generator
 i said is there anything else you need
 they said sir we could use an extra generator
 i said we'll get it for you we'll get it
 so i had it included in the price
 these people know exactly what i'm talking about
 it's called included in the price
 but think of it there's hundreds of deals like that
 but you're one person and that's why i got mark meadows involved because he's from north carolina
 he's from north carolina and he's cheap as hell
 i need some cheap people
 oh there's many hundreds and hundreds of stories
 i could tell you so much
 it's crazy
 the biden agenda would collapse our economy and destroy your country
 it would destroy your social security and protections for preexisting conditions it will
 he's going to drain your medicare by giving away our healthcare to illegal immigrants
 and i will tell you this you're going to have socialized medicine
 that's as sure as you're there
 and obama lied 28 times when he said you can keep your doctor you can keep your plan
 it was a lie
 said it 28 times that we have but it was a lie
 but now you're really losing your doctor
 you're going to have socialized medicine
 eliminate private healthcare insurance for 180 million americans who love their healthcare
 they have the best in the world
 his running mate sponsored the socialist takeover of healthcare
 you saw that
 he wants to ban private insurance
 you're going to lose â€¦ 180 million people are going to lose their healthcare under this biden character and he has no clue
 they're going to take it away from him
 they're going to be running him ragged
 sign this
 sign this
 okay
 what is it
 doesn't matter
 just sign it president right now
 i'm getting tired
 i'd like to rest i'd like to let kamala take over as president
 that's no way to get into the office because we're going to have a woman president someday but you know what
 it can't be kamala
 kamala
 nobody treated him worse and he picked her
 i'll tell you i was â€¦ brilliant forecast
 he could never pick her
 she called him a racist
 right
 she talked about me too-ing him
 he was going to be me too-ed
 right
 me-too-ed
 a lot of bad things
 there was nobody
 think of it even pocahontas treated him better
 she knocked the hell out of bloomberg but she left him sort of alone
 i think she felt sorry for him
 i heard she felt sorry for him
 i don't want people to feel sorry for our president
 i want other people really to feel sorry for themselves because we have somebody that knows what they're doing
 we can't have it
 we can joke we can play games we can have fun
 you can't have this guy as your president
 you can't have him
 maybe i'll sign an executive order
 you cannot have him as your president
 no but you know this
 everybody knows this
 and you know what
 people are going to vote for him because they feel sorry for him
 i feel sorry for him too
 i feel sorry for him
 and maybe he'll show up for an hour-and-a-half at a debate
 who the hell knows
 i don't know
 but you know
 you see the condition he's in
 you can't have him as your president
 and you know what
 you can't have her as your vice president potentially going to be president
 and that's why they're pushing so hard because they know he's going to be out very soon and she's going to take over
 and she is the furthest left person of anybody
 she is rated not by me she is rated further left than even bernie sanders
 okay
 he's second she's first
 we will hire more police
 thank you sheriffs
 thank you sheriffs
 i love the sheriffs
 we got the endorsement from all the sheriffs in florida everybody up in ohio and texas
 we have the stuff nobody's ever seen anything like it the endorsements from law enforcement
 we're going to increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement
 we will ban deadly sanctuary cities
 we will defeat everybody that we have to including the virus but we will defend the dignity of work and we will defend the sanctity of life
 we will uphold religious liberty free speech and the right to keep and bear arms
 we will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep â€¦ you know this right
 it's okay right
 we will keep america out of these ridiculous foreign wars
 we will maintain american's unrivaled military might and we will ensure peace through strength
 it's about time
 we will end surprise medical bills require price transparency and further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs which we're doing an unbelievable job on other than the fact that the drug companies are spending a fortune because they don't like me much
 you will see drug prices prescription drugs dropping 50 60 70 in a very short period of time
 favored nations clauses
 we will strongly protect medicare and social security and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions
 america will land the first woman on the moon and the united states will be the first nation to land an astronaut on mars
 you have to see what we've done with nasa
 we'll be the first one on mars i hope
 we will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriot education to our schools patriotic education
 we will teach our children to love our country honor our history and always respect our great american flag
 and we will live by the timeless words of our national motto and we will never change it by the way
 we will never change it
 they took the word god out of the pledge of allegiance twice
 i said did they make a mistake
 did they make a mistake
 they didn't for them
 they made a mistake for us
 we're not going to put up with it
 but we will keep in god we trust
 for years you had a president who apologized for america
 now you have a president who is standing up for america and standing up for the great people of north carolina
 this is the most important election we've ever had
 remember it
 we're going to be a socialist country
 we're going to be a communist country
 these people are further â€¦ they're much further left than socialism
 these people are sick
 so get your friends get your family get your neighbors get your coworkers and get out and vote
 get out and vote
 and watch to make sure they're not cheating which they will be
 early voting has already begun
