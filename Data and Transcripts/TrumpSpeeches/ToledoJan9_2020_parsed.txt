well thank you very much
 vice president mike pence great job you're doing
 and hello toledo
 we love toledo
 you remember i was here a lot
 you remember 2016 what a year that was right
 and 2020 is going to be even better no doubt
 but i'm thrilled to hold the first rally of 2020 right here in the great state of ohio
 and as we begin the new year our economy is booming wages are soaring workers are thriving and america's future has never ever looked brighter ever
 we're the envy of every country in the world
 we've created seven million brand new jobs since our election
 and we will soon be replacing the disaster known as nafta with the incredible brand new usmca the historic victory for ohio farmers workers and manufacturers but really a great victory for the united states
 it's an incredible agreement
 you remember i came and i'd always talk about how bad our trade deals are
 we did a brand new one with korea
 so now we have south korea we just finished a big one 40 billion with japan
 on january 15 we're signing a monster a big beautiful monster 40 to 50 billion to our farmers
 our farmers will be taking in i keep saying go buy larger tractors
 go buy larger tractors
 i said there's no way i don't know if you know this story my people wanted 20 billion to purchase right
 20 billion 20 that's a lot money that's a lot of corn 20 billion and i said make it 50
 china's very big
 and they said okay
 they said sir the farmers can't produce that much
 i said let the farmers tell me that
 tell them to go out and remember and buy a bigger what
 tractor buy a bigger tractor
 you'll produce it
 so 40 to 50 billion of agriculture product and the manufacturers and the car companies and we brought a lot of car companies into ohio you know that
 a lot of them are coming in
 a lot of them have already been brought in
 they're coming in from japan they're coming in from all over the world
 this is where they want to be
 they want to be in the united states
 this is where the action is
 they're all coming back
 i used to go around and talk about how everyone's leaving
 they were all leaving
 a lot of you were victims of that leaving
 these companies would leave they'd go to mexico they'd go to canada they'd close up they'd buy from china
 now they're all coming back new ones old ones they're all coming back and many are coming right here to ohio
 and just in case you didn't know it ohio just had the best year economically in the history of your state
 that's not bad that's not bad
 and this year's going to be even better and maybe much better
 but weeks ago i signed the largest ever investment in the united states military  738 billion and we created the sixth branch of the united states armed forces the space force and everybody's excited about that
 after years and years of devastating defense cuts we have fully rebuilt the united states military
 some of it's still coming in
 we have everything
 we've got new planes we've got new rockets new missiles we've got new everything and it's either here or coming in 2
5 trillion in new investments
 so our military is now stronger and more powerful than ever before
 and if you remember three years ago when i took over we were depleted
 our military was totally depleted
 and by the way speaking of our military have we taken care of our vets with choice with choice
 that was a big thing
 you know i used to go around and the va was a terrible situation
 people would wait weeks
 he's right he said yes it was
 you don't hear too much about that anymore have you noticed
 choice and accountability you know what accountability is
 for 44 years they tried to get accountability
 that's somebody bad works for the va you couldn't fire them
 you couldn't fire them
 they could be sadistic they could be thieves they could be whatever they were you couldn't get rid of them
 we got accountability approved and now we say you're fired get out
 we get somebody that's good
 44 years and maybe most importantly of all is choice va veterans choice
 so you now wait in line and a lot of times you'd wait in line for four or five six weeks you couldn't see a doctor
 now you don't have to wait
 you go out to a private doctor you get yourself taken care of we pay the bill
 what a difference it's made
 what a difference it's made
 you know when i was a little bit newer to this gameâ€“ that's okay they got it they got it
 they go home to mommy
 go on home to mommy
 go on home to mommy
 it's a beautiful sight
 thank you security
 do we love law enforcement by the way
 so with the va i used to go around saying why don't they do that
 why don't these people why don't they go to a private doctor and work something out
 and i thought it was a brilliant plan
 i said i'm telling you i am such a smart guy
 i said this is the most brilliant thing ever
 and i went back to my people and i said i have an idea
 a veteran's sick they can't get the kind of service they need they need a certain kind of doctor i have an idea such a great idea
 you get to go out private you're going to pick out a doctor you're going to get yourself fixed up
 we're going to pay the bill right
 and you know what happened
 and i said how brilliant is that
 they said sir we've been working on that for 48 years but we've never been able to get it approved
 so i was very very disillusioned but you know what i'm good at
 getting things approved
 and we got it approved
 so we signed that 11 months ago and what a difference that's made in terms of your lines and in terms of people's health
 people would wait online for weeks and some people weren't very sick and they'd end up being terminally ill
 they couldn't get to see the doctor
 now they go out they get a doctor we take care of them
 we can take care of our vets
 so we're using this great power not to pursue conflict but to really preserve and i mean in the true sense of the word preserve peace
 we have this tremendous military and you know what that is
 that's really a great fighting force but i hope we never have to use it
 i really do
 you saw an example of that a couple of days ago
 so we seek friends not enemies but if you dare to threaten our citizens you do so at your own grave peril
 we've never had a military what we have now we've never had anything like it
 we were looking at planes that were old and tired 50 60-year-old planes
 you've heard the story the grandfather flew them the son flew them the current wonderful person flew them the whole family flew them
 those are all gone now folks
 those are all gone
 in october of last year us special operations forces executed a daring nighttime raid that killed the bloodthirsty founder and leader of isis
 the animal known as al- baghdadi is dead
 and the entire isis caliphate is destroyed and his terrorist empire and he was indeed a monster has been totally demolished
 we killed thousands and thousands of isis warriors fighters and we have thousands of them right now locked up where they should be
 nobody has ever done what we've done in three years
 and i'll say this when we took it over it was a mess
 we did it in a short period of time but when we took it over it was not good
 and last week the united states once again took the bold and decisive action to save american lives and deliver american justice
 and you know what i'm talking about
 for years the sadistic mass murderer qasam soleimani planned and executed attacks against american targets killing and wounding thousands of us service members and many many thousands and even hundreds of thousands of other people
 as the leader of iran's terrorist quds force soleimani spread death destruction and mayhem across the middle east and far beyond
 he ordered the violent assault on the american embassy in baghdad
 and you saw this was the anti-benghazi
 we got there very quickly
 we got there very quickly
 this is the exact opposite we did it exactly the opposite of benghazi where they got there so late all they saw when they got there days later were burning embers from the days before
 that's all they saw
 we got there very early
 we saw what was happening
 i saw what was happening and i said what's that all about
 and that was going to be another benghazi
 had they broken through the final panels of glass they were breaking and breaking it had they gotten through we would have had either hundreds of dead people or hundreds of hostages
 that wasn't going to happen
 and i called up our great generals and i said get them over there now
 and one of our leaders one of our really admired people said sir we'll have them there tomorrow
 i said nope get in the planes right now have them there immediately and they got there immediately fortunately
 but he directed the recent rocket strikes that wounded four american service members badly wounded and killed an american citizen
 that was just before we happened to hit him
 soleimani was actively planning new attacks and he was looking very seriously at our embassies and not just the embassy in baghdad
 but we stopped him we stopped him quickly and we stopped him cold
 so at my direction the united states military eliminated qasam soleimani and ended his rampage through not only that part of the world but much bigger parts of the world he was all over
 he was a bad guy he was a bloodthirsty terror and he's no longer a terror he's dead
 and yet now i see the radical left democrats have expressed outrage over the termination of this horrible terrorist
 and you know instead they should be outraged by soleimani's savage crimes and the fact that his countless victims were denied justice for so long
 he was the king of the roadside bomb
 you know of the roadside bomb and then they got bigger and he'd send them over to afghanistan and iraq
 and when you see our friends and our great wounded warriors and our great warriors when you see them without their legs and without arms and with so much damage it's most likely that he caused that damage because that's what he liked
 he loved planting the roadside bomb
 so now he's gone and that's a good thing
 bernie sanders crazy bernie has condemned the us military strike on soleimani the world's top terrorist think of it the world's top terrorist and we're having people like nancy pelosi that's a real genius do you believe that one
 nancy nervous nancy
 but here's a guy who slaughtered and butchered civilians all over and military whoever was in his way and we have bernie and nancy pelosi we have them all they're all trying to say how dare you take him out that way
 you should get permission from congress
 you should come in and tell us what you want to do
 you should come in and tell us so that we can call up the fake news that's back there and we can leak it
 that's a lot of corruption back there folks
 no but think seriously so they want meâ€¦ so these are split-second decisions
 you have to make a decision
 so they don't want me to make that decision
 they want me to call up maybe go over there let me go over to congress or come on over to the white house let's talk about it
 when can you make it
 well i won't be able to make it today sir so how about say in a couple of days
 oh good come on over
 no we got a call we heard where he was we knew the way he was getting there and we had to make a decision
 we didn't have time to call up nancy who is not operating with a full deck
 no they want us to call can you imagine calling crooked adam schiff
 he's so crooked he's so crooked
 shifty schiff and say gee adam how are you doing
 listen we have the world's number one terrorist killed thousands and thousands of people
 we'd like to set up a meeting so we can discuss his execution
 would you be willing to meet
 well i won't be able to make it this week
 well you know he's traveling fast
 we got him lined up adam you little pencil-neck
 nine inches
 he buys the smallest shirt collar you can get and it's loose
 now come on adam we got to meet faster on it
 we got to take this guy out
 we're not going to have another shot at him maybe ever again
 but i can't make it now because i'm trying to impeach trump i'm trying to impeach even though he did nothing wrong
 by the way did you see i did nothing wrong
 they don't even know what in the hell is going on
 in fact it's so weak she doesn't want to put in the articles it's so weak
 they're so pathetic
 they're so pathetic
 so they want us to call them
 now schiff is a big leaker
 he leaks to crazy cnn
 see with the little red light on over there
 not too many people are watching cnn
 but he leaks
 so he'll say you know off the record i got to hurry up because everyone's watching me in the hallway on my cell phone off the record they've got the number one terrorist in the world soleimani and they're going to get him they're going to take him out in the next 10 minutes
 please don't tell anybody i told you
 so we have breaking news president trump within the next 20 25 minutes looks to be taking out terrorist general soleimani
 he's going to do it
 it should be happening in about the next 20 minutes 19 18 17
 then we get back to the battlefield how'd you do fellas
 i don't know sir he disappeared
 i don't know what happened to him
 they want us to tell them so that they can leak it to their friends in the corrupt media
 you got to say though that's a lot of media right
 that's the way the academy awards used to look when it was successful
 then they started hitting us all the time and it became unsuccessful
 i love it i love it actually
 oh they have some bad ones here tonight
 they have some really bad ones some really sick ones
 they have one good one by the way one good one
 they have one good one a bunch of bad ones
 very very dishonest people and we have some great ones too
 we have some great journalists great reporters
 but you've got a tremendous amount of dishonest media people like i have never seen in my life before
 they write things that they know are wrong
 they write if you watched for the last three years think of it and then they get pulitzer prizes but it turned out to be all wrong
 how do you do that
 they get pulitzer prizes for being wrong
 the pulitzer prize doesn't mean a thing
 it doesn't mean a thing
 i mean i'm here to tell you about the nobel peace prize
 i'll tell you about that
 i made a deal
 i saved a country
 and i just heard that the head of that country is now getting the noble peace prize for saving the country
 i said did i have something to do with it
 yeah but you know that's the way it is
 as long as we know that's all that matters
 i saved a big war
 i saved a couple of them
 but under my administration we will never make excuses for america's enemies we will never hesitate in defending american lives and we will never stop working to defeat radical islamic terrorism never
 and nobody's done it like we've done it
 and it's we it's we
 it's not me it's we
 it's a whole movement
 there has by the way never been a movement like this
 you know outside i don't know what this place holds it's like 10 11000 people right
 outside you have thousands and thousands of people that want to get in
 there's never been a movement like this
 there's never been a movement like this
 and i'll tell you maybe i'm wrong but this is bigger than it was in 2016 because in 2016 i said what we're going to do but now i've completed more promises than i've made
 i mean i've actually completed more right
 like as an example many of you were here look at all those beautiful red hats keep america great that's good
 but i never talked about did you ever hear me prior to the election talk about space force
 i never talked about it
 we did space force but did we ever speak about it
 no
 there were many things that we've done that we never spoke about right
 right to try you know about right to try right
 they've been trying to get it for 44 years right to try
 that's people that are very sick terminally ill and they can't get medicine that possibly works
 and very well we have the greatest labs and the greatest doctors in the world the greatest scientists in the world we have the greatest medicines in the world
 if they have something that they're pretty sure is going to work but is going to take another six years i brought those times way back by the way way down but they would travel to asia they would travel to europe they would travel all over the world to try and get a cure because we wouldn't sell them the medicine because we didn't want to take a chance on making the people sick
 i said wait a minute they're going to die
 they're going to die
 well sir we can't take the liability
 i said then we'll draw up a statement assessing all liability taking all liability away from the country away from the insurance companies away from the healthcare companies away from the doctors
 and with the great help of a lot of incredible republicans and we had some democrats help us we passed right to try and you have to see how this works
 some people are being many people are being saved
 and you know the drug companies didn't like it because they didn't want to take people that sick because they didn't want it on their charts
 i said i understand that
 we won't include that
 we'll have a separate list over here
 they said oh would you do that
 i said yeah i'll do that i'll do that
 but i didn't talk about right to try
 i never said i was going to get that done we got it done
 that was a tough one to get done
 it sounds simple but it was tough
 there's nothing easy in this country
 you know they said to me a friend of mine the other day who's the toughest country to deal with president
 he used to call me donald
 i've known this guy for a long time
 i'd like to say 20 years but it's much more than that
 i just don't want to tell you how long it's too long
 and i said call me donald
 you've always called me donald
 i can't
 he calls me mr
 president
 i've known this guy forever
 he used to call me hey donald let's go out to dinner
 you know before he'd go hey let's go out to dinner
 now he goes mr
 president sir how are you
 right
 how are you
 but what we've done and he said he told me what you've done we've never seen anything like it
 so many people are saying that
 we are all together doing something not only in terms of the election not only in terms of what we're doing right now
 don't forget it's a long way to the election
 you know we have what 10 months
 that's a long way
 this is my first stop of the year first major stop of the year
 this is it
 and we start
 by the way let's do one of those polls right now do you mind
 is there anything more fun than a trump rally
 here we are
 anything more fun than a trump rally
 here we are
 we have the greatest phrase of all time make america great again and all due respect i'll never end â€¦ i'm a little superstitious
 i'll never end it make america great again but i see all those hats
 i see all those hats changing it a little bit but make america great again
 i said you know today we just hit the highest stock price in the history of our country
 your 401ks are at records your stocks are great but what it really means to me is jobs more importantly than anything else
 we have the best jobs the best everything right
 we just hit â€¦ i can't really say make america great again
 our military is rebuilt 2
5 trillion
 our military is rebuilt
 we're doing great numbers
 economically our country is the strongest it's ever been
 you have factories moving back into ohio
 you never saw anything like it right
 you had your best year
 when i say make america great again what that sort of means is we didn't get there but we did get there
 now i have a new theme
 it's called keep america great
 keep america great
 now i'm a very loyal person and i am concerned about changing the theme because make america great again i think was the greatest political campaign in history
 i mean crooked hillary spent three or four times more money than i have spent
 crooked hillary wait crooked â€¦ we should lock her up i'll tell you
 crooked hillary spent three or four times more
 i wanted to be a little bit â€¦ i have to say that was a great campaign and i don't want to change it
 i don't want to have this incredible 2016 then go with something and if something ever happened this country will go to hell i just â€¦ you know the stocks i'm talking about the records
 you don't have records this way
 you have records
 get used to it because if that happened you will see things happen that aren't good
 but i have to now say do i want to change the greatest theme in political history make america great again with keep america great right
 let's take a little applause right
 we'll go make america great again you'd clap if you want that
 then we would go keep america great you'd clap if you like that
 okay are you ready
 first make america great again
 ready
 keep america great
 you know that i call that a free poll
 that's better than a poll
 do you ever see these crazy polls that come out
 we're doing great in the polls by the way
 remember i used to come out and talk about the polls
 we'll start doing that very soon
 we're doing great in the polls but this is like a free poll
 somebody else would go out they have all this money that they raised and they give somebody 1 million and they'll ask 200 people that question
 then they'll say well make america great again is better but i will tell you i haven't heard one thing where that was true
 with all of these â€¦ i would have said instinctively make america great again could not be beaten
 i've probably done this 10 times
 i have never had it win
 it's keep america great and that's what we're doing but we're going to use both
 we're going to use both â€¦ good
 keep america great
 we're going to use both but keep america great
 that's probably going to be the dominant theme
 for eight years the obama administration enabled and emboldened- â€¦ the iranian regime
 they gave iran 150 billion including 1
7 billion- â€¦ in hard cold cash
 can you imagine
 no no can you imagine
 1
7 billion 1
8 billion in cash
 the foolish iran nuclear deal financed iranian aggression while allowing a quick path to nuclear breakout that's what it did
 by the way it expires so soon
 they can have nuclear weapons
 they're not as i said before they will not have nuclear weapons
 â€¦ they hit us with 16 missiles and i said how many
 we were ready to go
 we were ready to go
 i said how many
 how many died
 how many were wounded
 sir none
 none
 pretty good warning system none
 how many were hurt
 how many were â€¦ none sir
 so we didn't do anything
 we were ready
 we were ready
 not that i wanted to but we were ready
 you have no idea
 a lot of people got very lucky
 â€¦ we have a lot of your congressmen right now in congress
 they said sir should we come with you
 i said no stay back and vote
 they're voting on some pretty important stuff right
 but we were able to get bill
 we thank you bill very much great job great warrior
 thank you bill
 ohio lieutenant governor jon husted
 thank you jon
 thank you jon

 thank you judy
 great job
 state senate president a man highly respected larry obhof
 thank you larry
 and a woman who really has become a great friend of mine
 she took over this party
 we fought like hell
 we had some other people that had their mind on taking over the party but they'd never had a chance against jane timken jane
 and the man who is in charge of my campaign in ohio i had a choice of five people
 i said i like this guy's name
 i don't know why
 his name is bob paduchik
 why do i like his name
 i said bob how are we doing
 he said you're going to win big sir
 because you know you keep hearing you cannot win unless you win the great state of ohio
 that's these guys
 once i was leading ohio by a lot in the poll
 they never say that anymore
 it's terrible
 they were saying it when they thought i wasn't going to win but we were ahead right from the beginning
 â€¦ i said bob let me ask you just out of curiosity i don't have these people
 the leaders are not with us
 is that good or bad
 he said sir it's great
 you just went up three points would you believe this by not having it
 he said don't worry sir you're going to win and we won by a lot
 now i understand we're up by a lot more than we ever thought possible
 bob was fantastic
 thank you bob
 â€¦ then one of these characters back there they put me in a contest with the late great abraham lincoln right
 who do you like better trump or abraham lincoln
 i said abraham lincoln- i said who do you like better
 they say they did a poll on this
 i think i remember the numbers
 all i know is we won against abraham honest abe
 we won 53 to 47
 can you believe that abraham lincoln
 i went back to the first lady i said first lady i just beat abraham lincoln in a poll
 i don't know if they had polls back then but abraham lincoln
 i always say i can be more presidential than any candidate that ever ran than any president other than maybe abraham lincoln when he's wearing his hat
 i like abe lincoln but when we're doing well we have a lot of support
 do you know why
 because our country is doing so well
 our country is doing so well
 when we went out we started and we went right to the top of the polls
 it wasn't like these folks today
 they are 2 3 but they're climbing
 we went right to the top from day one
 we never missed center stage in the debates
 remember those great debates
 we actually got high ratings
 they don't get very good ratings anymore
 they're like it's like death watching
 i should watch
 you know i'm supposed to watch
 it's like my job
 try and watch watch the competition but it's like watching death
 â€¦ did you see where pocahontas is slipping badly
 bernie bernie has gone up
 he's surging bernie's crazy bernie he's surging and biden doesn't know the difference between iran and iraq
 he's gotten it wrong four times
 he goes when we took our shot at iraq â€¦ no no no
 they're all saying no no they're screaming it's iran iran
 what
 his son right
 where's hunter where is hunter
 no i went to one of them
 i said we have to have where is hunter as a witness
 they said what do you mean where is hunter
 i said that's his first name
 i have now made his first name where's
 where's hunter
 here's a guy made no money got thrown out of the military forces i think the navy got thrown out had no job had no nothing so he went from that to making millions of dollars a year as soon as sleepy joe became vice president
 he made millions of dollars a year
 would anybody in this room do that for millions of â€¦ i would
 he made millions and millions of dollars a year
 ukraine took care of him
 how about china
 he walked out with 1
5 billion to manage and he never did it before
 he didn't know anything about oil and gas
 he was making a fortune
 so where is hunter
 where the hell are you hunter
 i'll tell you i sort of hope it's joe because he will hear where's hunter every single debate nine times a debate
 where is hunter
 â€¦ howdy doody
 the problem is a lot of people don't remember alfred e
 neuman
 don't say that
 you look much younger than that i must say
 you have mayor pete
 i mean give me a break
 can you believe mayor pete
 this is going to be the president of the united states
 how would he be against negotiating against president xi of china
 we just made one hell of a deal
 you're going to see the numbers very soon you know
 one hell of a deal
 they didn't like those tariffs
 thanks to republican leadership america is winning again and america most importantly is respected again respected like never before
 you know for years nato has taken advantage of the united states
 we protect europe from russia and the numbers have been going down for many many years 15 years 18 years
 the numbers is like a roller coaster down
 i went over and i said folks you got to pay your bills
 you're delinquent
 you're delinquent
 then they don't like me
 they say we like obama better
 they should like obama better
 obama would go in and say thank you very much for coming
 we appreciate it
 bye-bye i'm going back to washington
 i'm going back
 i'll be violating the carbon footprint
 i'm going to hawaii to play golf
 i drive to play a round of golf at the course i own it doesn't even cost them anything
 he flies to hawaii nobody cares
 if i drive 20 minutes it's like donald trump is playing golf today
 he violates the carbon footprint but just think of it
 think of where we've come
 think of where we've come
 a great congressman from tennessee they have â€¦ it's a great state
 they have early voting very early voting probably the earliest
 he said i don't know
 i just left tennessee
 this was in november
 this was the election 2016
 he said i just left this incredible state of mine and i love that state
 sir we've seen lines of people that didn't vote before because they never were inspired to vote and these are people that never voted
 they had hats on trump
 they have pins on trump trump trump and trump
 they have the bands on you know like a miss universe prom
 it says trump pence and they've got buttons all over it
 they've got shirts saying trump and trump pence
 i never saw anything like it
 if every state is like tennessee sir i hate to tell you you're going to have one hell of a victory and that's what happened right
 that's happened
 you did it
 you did it and i think we're going to have bigger numbers even bigger numbers because i'll tell you what we're a long way from the election
 i think the crowds today are bigger than they were the day before the election last time
 i really do
 you know elizabeth warren- â€¦ sadly referred to she of great indian heritage
 remember i used to say i have more indian blood in me than she has and i have none
 i turned out to be right
 you look at what she's doing you look at what she's saying the lies the deceit the fraud you see it all
 we are going to do so great
 it's got to be something that's going to be special
 it's going to be for the record books
 the evangelicals called some of the greatest pastors ministers preachers and they just called today five of the most respected people
 they said things that were incredible
 they said there's never been anything like this in the church that they can â€¦ some of them have been doing it for 30 40 years
 they said we have never seen enthusiasm like we see for this president and for this presidency all of us like we have right now
 â€¦ he never said that before
 billy graham wasn't somebody that would vote and say he voted
 franklin graham said billy graham maybe the greatest of all maybe the greatest of all time he said my father billy graham who was very old at the time and in trouble he was in trouble he was not well he voted for donald trump
 what a great tribute that was to me
 what a great tribute
 great family
 unemployment has reached the lowest level in over 51 years
 african-american hispanic-american and asian-american unemployment have all reached the lowest rates ever ever ever recorded
 wages are rising fast
 they're going up very fast and the biggest percentage increase makes me happy are for blue-collar workers
 40 million
 think of this 40 million american families are now benefiting from the republican child tax credit each receiving an average of over 2200 a year
 now america lost â€¦ this is hard to believe because you think how could it possibly be true
 but this is what happened
 probably it's the number one reason i'm running
 america lost 60000 factories under the previous administration 60000
 you wouldn't believe that it's possible but i know it's true because i've said it 50 times and the fakers back there they've never corrected me
 no it's true
 no it's true
 if i were slightly off if it were if i was off by two factories there'd be a headline donald trump told a fib
 donald trump gets to be a pinocchio again
 no
 think of it 60000 factories plants and factories closed closed
 they went to mexico
 they went to china
 60000
 it's not even â€¦ take a look at a map and put 60000 little dots
 i mean you wouldn't believe it could be that many but it is it's 60000 closed gone
 they're all coming back
 they're all coming back
 right now just in a very short period of time we've added 12000 brand new factories and many more are coming in
 one of the reasons they're coming in is we've eliminated a record number of job- killing regulations saving the average american household 3000 a year
 total income gains for median households will reach over ready
 10000 a family
 10000
 now under the bush administration the 10000 that includes what we've done in terms of median income
 i'm adding in there the tax cuts which are tremendous 2400
 i'm adding the regulation cuts i'm adding the whole package over 10000
 now under president bush it was 450
 under barack hussein obama it was 975
 under president donald j
 trump it's 10000 in three years three
 in three years
 don't forget president bush eight years 450
 president obama eight years 975
 president trump three years not even not even not even but three years 10000
 we're going up
 we're going up
 â€¦ clean coal
 what they do with coal today is incredible clean coal
 with the help of energy workers right here in ohio the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world by far number one
 we were number one
 â€¦ you know there's a state known as texas and i won texas by a lot just like i won ohio by a lot
 how would you like to go into texas and say by the way we don't want your oil or natural gas anymore
 how about that beto
 remember he said i was born to be president
 anybody that says that i said that's the end of his career
 remember he had the cover of the magazine
 i won't mention the magazine sleazebag magazine
 he was born to be president and right after that he came tumbling down but he's from texas so he was against religion he was against oil and he was against guns
 abraham lincoln could not win in texas with that platform
 that's not a good platform
 it's not a good platform but you have people that want to shut down the oil industry
 if you do that you're going to shut down half your businesses
 it's really more than that and the rest of them are not going to be able to pay because the cost of this energy would be so expensive
 we have all forms of energy
 we have every form of energy and we are doing great but they want to cripple your state's economy
 the voters of ohio will never let that happen never going to let it happen
 our air and our water right now is cleaner than it's been in 40 years
 sadly i can't say historic because you know a couple of hundred years ago there was nobody here right
 i assume that 2 300 years ago was cleaner probably
 you never know but our water and our air is as clean as it's ever been and i took us out of that horrible paris accord
 i always say how are you doing with the paris accord
 don't ask
 saved trillions and trillions of dollars that was put in there to hurt us in my opinion
 it was put in there to hurt us
 we were paying money to india
 we were paying money to china
 china's didn't kick in until 2030 we kicked in immediately
 we had to pay money
 russia kicked in in 20 â€¦ let's see they kicked in before
 they were 1990 wait they were 1996
 that was a very dirty period of air so they didn't have â€¦ we kick in now and that it's just unacceptable
 we would have spent trillions and trillions of dollars
 we would have had to close up i think at least 25 to 30 of our businesses
 who the hell would make a deal like that right
 who would make a deal like that
 no how unfair
 you look at russia
 you look at china
 you look at india
 they all got these massive breaks
 we got no breaks and we're paying money
 i say sometimes to france how are the yellow vests working out
 because they don't like raising their taxes and sending the money to faraway places that they'd never heard of
 so we are in good shape
 it took a certain amount of courage to do that
 i said i'm going to get killed on this one and you know what
 i did it and i was applauded because the people get it
 the people know what we're doing and they're tired of being ripped off by the rest of the world
 they're tired of being ripped off by the rest of the world
 â€¦ i immediately canceled the obama administration's job-killing catastrophe which would have dealt a death blow to the united states auto industry the transpacific partnership
 it was a disaster
 that was going to be worse than nafta
 nafta i always say the world's worst deal
 i think that would have been worse
 it would have taken the car industry
 it would have taken many of your industries
 that was a setup for the united states to get fleeced
 â€¦ that's going to include because we take care of our great auto workers of toledo the home of jeep
 how good is jeep
 i've taken the toughest-ever action against china's chronic trade abuses including tariffs on 370 billion worth of chinese made goods bringing billions and billions of dollars into our treasury
 i gave some of that money because they were targeted to our farmers and our farmers did just fine
 now the deal is done and the other deals are done and the farmers are doing very well
 we love our farmers and they never complain
 they never complain
 you know when they'd go the fake news back there they'd go and they'd talk- and when they come the fake news back they go and talk to the farmers
 what do you think of president trump
 china is deciding not to buy anymore of this
 you know what the farmers would say we're going to have to suffer for a while because there's china and there's other nations have been ripping us off for years
 the president is right and we're with the president
 how great
 how great
 but our strong action paid off and we'll sign that terrific and fully enforceable phase one trade deal with china
 and again we're keeping the tariffs on because we use that for other money
 we are taking billions
 remember what i said
 we're not paying for it
 because china devalued their currency and then they put a lot of money into the pot
 we're not paying for it
 and now they're starting to say i guess he was right
 and our trade deficit as a result has come has really come substantially down
 it was just in the papers today
 the trade deficit has come down
 as a result of our actions steel mills all across ohio you know this better than i do are roaring back to life
 jsw steel is investing five hundred million dollars in acero junction
 republic steel is reopening the loraine mill that they idled in 2016
 charter steel is building a 150 million dollar mill in cuyahoga heights and nucor is investing 85 million dollars at a facility in marion ohio
 think of that
 i think you do
 the steel industry was dead and now it's vibrant
 all told american steel companies are currently making 13 billion dollars worth of new investments all across our nation
 think of that
 they weren't investing 25 cents
 the industry was dead
 now it's vibrant
 after years of rebuilding other nations we are finally rebuilding our nation
 we are finally putting america first
 but while we are creating jobs and killing terrorists the washington democrats are wasting america's time with demented hoaxes and crazy witch hunts
 think of it
 the day they came down that escalator it started
 who the hell else could they take in this stuff
 right
 can i get some credit for that
 most guys would have been in a corner with their thumb in their mouth saying mommy mommy take me home
 these are bad people
 the democrat politicians we're fighting today are the same ones who took a sledgehammer to ohio jobs in factories
 they destroyed your factories
 they destroyed your jobs
 but they're losing and we're winning and america's comeback continues full speed ahead
 on no issue have democrat politicians more clearly betrayed the american people than the issue of illegal immigration
 far left radical politicians support deadly sanctuary cities and demonstrated their contempt scorn and disdain for everyday americans and the american family
 these jurisdictions release dangerous violent criminal aliens out of their jails and directly onto your streets where they are free to rob attack and kill american citizens but stop it
 they want open borders
 can you believe it
 and because of democrats' open border policies they want open borders
 they want more people flowing
 come on in
 come on in
 innocent americans are being brutalized and murdered by illegal alien criminals
 as just one example right here in ohio you all know about it an illegal alien went on a deadly crime spree attempting to rape a 14-year-old girl
 then raping an murdering a 60-year old woman
 then shooting at a woman who took a shortcut through the park and was walking with her children
 and finally the police came
 we love our police
 and they were able to apprehend this terrible criminal
 thanks to democrat policies ms-13 gang membersâ€¦ they're the worstâ€¦ were allowed to infiltrate the country
 you know i called them animals and nancy pelosi said they're not animals
 they're human beings
 take a look at what's happened to her district
 her district is one of the most disgusting dirtyâ€¦ it used to be one of the best in the country
 now it's a disgrace what's happened
 drug dealings all over the place
 the homeless they're not taking care of
 tents down major thoroughfares
 what happened in san francisco in particular her district and she lives in this beautiful house
 but they turn all these arsonists out including killing their victims with machetes ms-13
 they kill them with machetes
 you know why
 because it's more painful than using a gun
 federal authorities recently discovered and rounded up more than 25 ms-13 gang members in central ohio
 and they will be sent to jail or frankly i they hold themâ€¦ i don't know that they can hold them
 they're going to be sent the hell back home
 last year alone ice officers who by the way are heroes
 these are brave people
 i don't want to do it
 you don't want to do it
 let's see you can do it
 you can do it
 you can do it
 most of you wouldn't
 i mean i've seen it
 they have these people that are like killers
 and now the guys are here
 and they want to call them a safe place
 and they run in and they're swinging and punching
 what the hell kind of a job is that
 that's what they do
 they're tough people
 they're great patriots
 who the hell wants to do it
 they're incredible ice
 and they get scorned and we take out thousands and thousands of ms-13 members every single year
 they throw them in the back of the van and we get them the hell out of our country
 but ice offices worked through ohio police to remove one thousand two hundred dangerous criminal aliens from your streets
 and on all your street do you see the difference now between what it is now
 we have a problem over there
 go ahead
 take your time
 take your time
 good thank you
 great job
 thank you
 okay these people here unlike you up there these people have been waiting for three days so that they could be here
 i don't know
 you know what
 if i had to wait three days i think i'd like your seat better
 i like your seat
 but democrats stand for crime corruption and chaos
 republicans stand for law order and justice
 that's really the way it is
 we side with law enforcement with law abiding americans not law breaking criminal aliens
 we are removing these illegal criminals and gang members from our country by the thousands
 we are sending them home
 and we will no let them back in
 and i have to tell you a lot of things are happening
 you're going to hear about that in two seconds
 thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border illegal crossing are down 75 since may
 we have ended catch and release
 catch and release you know what catch and release is
 we catch them
 we take down their name and we release them
 what kind of crap is that
 these are the policies that we inherited
 you catch somebody take their name
 say please come back in three years
 right
 and we're releasing them back to the community
 and if you don't do that everybody gets sued
 can you believe this
 we have ended catch and release
 the other one beauty how about that lottery
 it's called visa lottery
 how about this
 they put their handâ€¦ these people are going to america
 bomb
 i will not use names because i'll be accused of something later
 but from honduras what about it
 el salvador we haveâ€¦ he's good
 only in ohio can that happen
 who's the man that did that
 who is that
 so anyway but in honduras guatemala they have like this lottery
 now the people i've gotten to know the government officials
 they're good
 they've made some good things
 they said hey we need to take our people back
 they're getting their people back
 before they wouldn't take them back
 they'd send them here to go into our county
 we'd bring them back under past administrations and then after that they'd say we're not taking them back
 we're not taking them back
 take them the hell our of here
 we're not letting you land your plane
 so we have the government flying the plane all over trying to get a couple prisoners bad people back
 now they take them back
 you know why
 because we said look if you don't take them back we're going to put tariffs on every single thing you sell
 now they say we'd love to take them back
 we'd love to take them back
 we'll take them back gladly sir
 no they couldn't get them back
 we'd take off with these absolutely gang members an we'd bring them back and they wouldn't accept them
 we couldn't land the plane
 we couldn't get anything through the border
 it comes through the border this way not that way
 but now they take them back
 they've been good actually
 they've been very good
 now we paid them a lot of money
 we paid them 500 million dollars a year
 can you believe we paid them 500 million through el salvador
 and i said oh there's not going to be any money anymore because you're not treating us right
 and they've been good
 they've been great
 they take them back
 how many would you like us to take
 we'll take as many as you want
 and here's the big thing
 ready
 you ready
 today in the newspapers in the fifth circuit court of appeals we won't the big big beautiful lawsuit when they were all suing us
 the wall is being built
 we built it
 we built already a tremendous amount
 but we're releasing four million dollars of military construction funds to build the biggest section of the wall
 it's literally being signed now and will be under construction very shortly in couple of weeks
 and we've already built over a 100 miles of wall
 how about that
 100 miles
 and by the end of next year we're going to have a lo more built
 and it's already having a big impact
 how about that democrats
 walls don't work
 we want technology
 i said what do you want to do
 they want drones
 oh good
 when people are rushing the caravans when they're rushing having a drone flying around is not going to help you do it
 okay
 nothing likeâ€¦ you know five years ago the democrats all wanted a wall
 they just could never get i built
 they didn't know how the hell to build it
 i do
 so we built 100 miles
 i think probably more than that now
 we have a lot under contract
 but we won our big case justâ€¦ i woke up
 they said sir we have good news
 they overturned a horrible decision from the lower court
 you can now fund the rest of the wall
 i said thank you very much
 thank you fifth circuit court of appeals have changed some
 they want crime
 they want gangs
 i'm saying all this stuff and then i say gee now i sort of understand why they hate me
 right
 but it's true
 it's true
 their policies are a disaster
 they're bad politicians and they're horrible policies but what they do is they stick together and then they're vicious
 they're vicious horrible people
 i didn't say that
 they're horrible people
 what they do to people is as disgrace but they stick together left their party and joined our party
 but we've done things nobody's ever done before
 but the democrats are taking their cues from socialist bernie sanders and that group
 omar aoc talib
 this is a jihadist woman talib
 talib
 boy what a group but they're the leaders of the party
 they're really my opinion dealers
 that's what happened
 that's how they got into this impeachment on this
 the leaders of the party areâ€¦ there's aoc talib and omar
 and pelosi beats them but she shakes and quivers and she's very soft
 but you know who the leader of your party is
 all of you
 you
 you're the leader of your party
 everybody believed me
 then she went down
 then she started coming up and then he went down
 it doesn't help me to do it a year-and-a-half before the election
 that's why like with the green new deal okay
 i want to say great things about it
 okay
 i don't want to knock it and then say oh we're not going to use that
 i like it when they say you no longer can fly airplanes
 no longer can you have any cows in meadows
 right
 no longer can you do anything
 we can't do anything anymore
 the green deal i love it
 i think it's great
 it should be debated
 it should be debated rally it's a month before
 you'll get to hear the real facts
 but i'm tired of talking about this 10 months before the election
 they can do more with the tape than they can do with a newspaper
 no they'll do it
 you'll see it
 somewhere you'll see it trump supports his plan
 they are sick
 republicans will defend middle class taxpayers and the right to keep the doctor of your choice
 we will protect patients with pre-existing conditions
 and we will protect your pre-existing physician
 you'll have your physician
 virtually every top democrat also now supports late term abortion ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up until the moment of birth
 that is why i have asked congress to prohibit late-term abortion because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from god
 radical democrats now have a party of high taxes high crime open borders late-term abortion socialism and blatant corruption
 the republican party is the party of the american worker the american family and the party of the american dream
 we still have the american dream
 mitch helped a lot
 he helped a lot
 it wasn't so easy
 mitch mcconnell
 we're aggressively combating the opioid epidemic and it's bad
 in 2018 drug overdose deaths in ohio fell byâ€¦ listen to thisâ€¦ 22
 that's not good enough but credit to opioid
 and as we continue rebuilding our military we have the star legendary army tank factory in lima
 and we've authorized 441 new striker fighting combat vehicles and 453 new abrams tanks to be built in the buckeye state
 that's a lot of tanks
 so wait just a quick story
 okay
 i'm proud of this
 so they had this army tank plant right in lima
 and i said what's going on
 they're closing it
 oh
 they're closing
 they're closing everything
 when i came they wanted to close everything
 so i was president-elect i think right around at that time
 and i went to lima and went through the factory where they make these trucks the plant
 and they make the tanks
 they make all of these army vehicle
 and i said these people are amazing
 you could never close this
 you could never re-open it again
 they'd been doing this for many many decades and this factory was incredible
 and i looked at the tanks they made
 they're the best in the world by abrams
 they're the best in the world
 i said wait a minute
 if you close this we're not going to beâ€¦ where are you going to build tanks
 this is the primary factory in the whole country
 i think it might be the only factory in the whole country

 please send us 200 tanks
 we don't want to send you any tanks because we're going to kick your ass
 we're going to make our own tanks
 right
 we've got to make our own tanks
 so i did something based on my instinct because instinct sometimes works better than anything else
 based on my instinct i said  you can't close this plant
 i went through that plant
 i spent two three hours talking to people who worked there
 i looked at some of the hydraulic and i'm i love all in the world tractors all of that stuff
 i know a lot about it
 and i looked at the carvings
 i looked at the metal
 i looked at how perfect everything was that turns around
 how perfect it fit
 they put it on and it would fit like within 1100th of an inch
 and i said you're not going to be able to do this anyplace else
 i said and we're going to be expanding our military
 we're going to be rebuilding
 who the hell's going to make our tanks if you close
 i said keep it open
 i actually it was all closed
 is there anybody from lima
 is that a true story
 right
 it was closed
 they announced it was closed
 it was all set to close
 i said you can't close this plant
 and now look the numbers i just gave you
 we're making almost 500 new tanks
 you could've never reopened a place like that
 it's incredible
 and you could've never gotten those workers
 they're really skilled people and if you did it would cost you billions and billions of dollars to do it
 it wouldn't have been as good as we have
 so that was something i did that i'm very proud of because i really over-rode a lot of talented people that wanted it to close
 i recognized israel's true capitol and opened the american embassy in jerusalem
 and we further recognized israeli sovereignty over the golan heights 52 years
 for years you watched as your politicians apologized for america
 now you have a president who is standing up for america and we are standing up for the great people of ohio
 and saying our present battle is the survival of the american nation
 if you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of americans have fought and died for and fought so hard to secure then we must devote everything we have toward victory in 2020
 we have to win
 you know we have to win
 because all of these things that we've done can be undone
 and you can have a country that goes to hell very very fast very very fast
 only in this way can we save the america we love and drain the washington swamp once and for all
 and i have seen that dirty rotten swamp better than anybody else in america
 a lot of crooked people disgusting crooked people
 with your help we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity
 together we will elect a republican congress to create a fair safe sane and lawful system of immigration
 we will enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase made in the u
s
a
 we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the aids epidemic in america
 nobody knew that
 it could've been done long before i got here
 they had the technology
 but we're ending the aids epidemic in america within 10 years
 isn't that amazing
 whoever thought that was possible
 who would have thought that's possible
 we will defend privacy free speech religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms
 and above all we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one big beautiful america
 we support protect and defend the constitution of the united states
 we stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement
 we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life
 we believe that faith and family not government and bureaucracy are the true american way
 we believe that children should be taught to love our country honor our history and to always respect our great american flag
 and we will always live by the words of our national motto in god we trust
 we stand on the shoulders of generations of ohio patriots who gave their blood sweat and tears for this beloved nation
 from cleveland to cincinnati from dublin to dayton and from columbus to toledo this state is the home of proud families and farmers and miners and manufacturers and aviators and astronauts
 ohio is where the wright brothers invented the airplane and where annie oakley got her gun
 ohio is the state that gave us american legends and american heroes like thomas edison neil armstrong and the great john glenn
 ohio is the place where strong american workers mined coal worked the railroads and forged the steel that made america into the greatest most powerful nation in the history of the world
 and we are making it greater than ever before
 proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country
 we are returning power to you the american people
 with your help your devotion and your drive we are going to keep on working
 we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning winning winning
 we are one movement one people one family and one glorious nation under god
 america is thriving like never before
 and ladies and gentlemen of ohio the best is yet to come
 because together we will make american wealthy again
 we will make america strong again
 we will make america proud again
 we will make america safe again
 and we will make america great again
 thank you toledo
 thank you
