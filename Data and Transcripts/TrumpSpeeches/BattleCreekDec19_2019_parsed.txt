thank you
 thank you
 thank you to vice president pence
 he's a good guy
 we've done a great job together
 and merry christmas michigan
 thank you michigan
 what a victory we had in michigan
 what a victory was that
 one of the greats
 was that the greatest evening
 but i'm thrilled to be here with thousands of hardworking patriots as we celebrate the miracle of christmas the greatness of america and the glory of god
 thank you very much
 and did you notice that everybody is saying merry christmas again
 did you notice
 saying merry christmas
 i remember when i first started this beautiful trip this beautiful journey i just said to the first lady you are so lucky
 i took you on this fantastic journey
 it's so much fun
 they want to impeach you
 they want to do worse than that
 by the way by the way by the way it doesn't really feel like we're being impeached
 the country is doing better than ever before
 we did nothing wrong
 we did nothing wrong
 and we have tremendous support in the republican party like we've never had before
 nobody's ever had this kind of support
 but this sacred season our country is thriving and it's thriving truly like it has never it has never happened before to the extent what's happening now
 and by the way your state because of us not because of local government but because of us because of the job that we've done
 because i understand she's not fixing those potholes
 that's what the word is
 it was all about roads and they want to raise those gasoline taxes on you
 we don't want to do that
 but she's not fixing the potholes
 but michigan's had the best year it's ever had
 best year it's ever had
 and that's because we have auto companies expanding and thriving and they're coming in from japan and they're coming in from a lot of other places
 look what's happening
 and you know i don't know if you know this but probably 10 years ago i was honored
 i was the man of the year by i think somebody whoever
 i was the man of the year in michigan
 can you believe it
 long time
 and that was long before i ever decided to do this
 i was happy
 i had a beautiful life
 what the hell did i do this for
 but look how we're doing
 do we love it
 i love it
 but anyway i was the man of the year and probably close to 10 years ago and i came to michigan
 he said you're still the man of the year
 thank you
 who said that
 thank you
 so i came in and i remember the speech so well
 i said why are you allowing them to steal your car companies
 why are you allowing them to go to mexico and to go from china where they come in from china they build them in china they sell them into our country with no tax and you lose your jobs you lose your factories the companies leave and you get nothing
 why are they lying
 i asked that a long time ago and we stopped it
 we've stopped it
 and you see that
 and we just made the usmca
 we're getting rid of nafta which i think is the worst trade deal ever
 and it's very exciting
 it's a great deal
 it's a great deal
 it's going to stop exactly what we were just talking about
 it makes it very very prohibitive
 they can do it but they've got to pay a hell of a big price to do it
 and history has proven that stops them
 but we have a great usmca that we negotiated with mexico with canada
 now from the standpoint of the farmers you know what's going on
 we had tremendous trade barriers in canada
 we had attacks on dairy products 297 tariff nobody talked about it with canada
 and we had some really bad things with mexico
 we now have a wonderful deal
 and if we didn't have a good deal you know what i would have done what
 what
 i would have put tariffs on both countries and that would have been it right
 that would have been it
 unfortunately the deal's been sitting with nancy pelosi for a long time and what happened
 and she had a lot of pressure especially from manufacturing areas farm areas a lot of pressure to sign it
 so here's what happens
 so i get along with labor
 i had a lot of union labor vote for me tremendous amount of labor
 in new york where i come from we have a lot of unions
 and that's okay
 that's fine
 so we left a little stuff for the union because we figured to get it signed we'll give a little bit and we did it and we have one great deal
 and now you have the democrats trying to take credit for this deal and that's okay
 whatever it takes
 for seven months it sits
 they don't do anything
 we give
 and by the way i spoke to the unions the day before i say fellows you got to get it done
 and union labor loves me and i love you too sir
 i love you too sir
 so we have a great deal with mexico with canada
 and it is true
 i say it out loud because i say it to them right now
 if they ever wanted to break the deal that's okay
 if somebody wants to break a deal with me you always have to have an alternative right
 and this country the deals we made we did a deal with south korea
 that's great
 we did a deal with japan 40 billion dollar deal with japan
 it was just a little piece of a deal
 okay
 that was a piece of a deal
 and i said to japan look you got to make this deal or we're going to put a 20 tariff on the cars
 and that's more money than anything we're talking about
 that's all right
 that's all right
 that's all right
 get her out
 ger her out of here
 oh well
 you're about to hear the greatest speech you've ever heard
 and that's going to be the publicity because all the fake news back there will say massive riot… massive riots
 fake news
 but seriously look look look they won't say it
 they won't say it because when we have protesters all in favor they don't talk about it but there's a slob
 there's a real slob
 wait wait a minute
 she'll get hell when she gets back home with mom
 but she made… look she screams a little bit
 and you know what i like to do
 avoid them
 because i'll tell you the big problem
 i could hardly hear her
 what happens is all of you people go crazy
 look look look and the place
 okay so there's one disgusting person who made… wait wait who made a… i wouldn't say this but made a horrible gesture with the wrong finger right
 now they won't say that the fake news they won't say it
 if one of us did that it would be like the biggest story ever
 i think it's terrible
 and i'll tell you the other thing i don't know who the security company is but the police came up but they want to be so politically correct so they don't grab her wrist lightly and get her out
 they say oh would you please come
 would you please come with me
 sure
 ma'am would you
 and then she gives the guy the finger and he oh oh
 you got to get a little bit stronger than that folks
 and they… 
 making another group of tariffs seven and a half percent
 this gives us a lot of currency to do the phase two deal which they want to start but we're taking in billions of dollars and to help the farmers who were targeted 16 billion and 12 billion the previous year helps the farmers
 so you know what we do out of that big check that we get all that money flows into the treasury
 out of the big check we gave the farmers 16 billion dollars and 12 billion for the previous year
 and you know the incredible thing and i was with a lot of farmers
 i was with a group of 36 farmers at the white house
 you know what they said to me
 i said don't worry about it
 we're going to take care of you guys
 and i used a bad word
 you know what word i used
 we're going to get you a subsidy
 and they said this two years ago i said how much were you targeted for
 this was the first year
 12 billion sir
 the second year was 16
 they were target
 that's what they didn't get from china
 so i said it's all right we're going to give you a subsidy of the same and we're going to take it out of the tariffs and we're going to have billions and billions of dollars left over
 and they said sir we don't want money
 we just want a level playing field
 i've never seen that before
 i've never seen that before
 so we will have invested in our military since i'm here which is less than three years
 our military by the way in all due respect to the previous two administrations our military was depleted
 it was depleted
 it was in bad shape
 we had fighter jets that were 35 years old
 we had planes that were 60 years… you heard where the father flew them the grandfather flew them and now the young son comes in
 we've got the best equipment in the world now
 spent two and a half trillion dollars made in the usa
 two and a half trillion
 we will shortly
 that'll be all finished
 we're going to have the greatest… now we have the best planes
 we're going to have the best ships
 we're building a lot of ships now
 we're building the most powerful weapons in the world
 now we don't want to even talk about it
 we never want to use them
 but you know the way we're not going to have to use them is if we have them
 we're building submarines the power of which nobody's ever seen before
 nobody's ever seen before
 it's funny we have these companies come in
 i like to make good deals
 you like to make good deals
 that's what we do right
 so these really countries that come in prime ministers presidents sometimes dictators those we can't deal with too much
 sir we'd like to buy a nuclear submarine
 i say no thanks
 i turn them all down
 you have no idea how many people… but we're building some of the… they're the most powerful weapons ever made by man or womankind
 i say mankind and womankind
 they can definitely fight
 they're the real deal
 these guys so good looking
 i said you could be a movie star
 go to hollywood
 no sir
 i like doing what i'm doing
 so i said to these guys you going to see just like central casting i said i said fellas how good is this plane
 they said sir it's great
 why
 because the enemy can't see it
 that helps
 stealth
 it's actually called super stealth
 so i said you mean they can't see so you shoot at them but they can't… he said they have no idea where we are sir
 i said that sounds good to me
 nobody does it
 nobody can do it
 we have the whole thing and we bought in a lot of those planes we bought in a lot of great stuff
 and i won't tell you the story but very early on i thought we were going to have a problem someplace and one of the generals came up to me and said sir don't go
 don't do it
 why
 we don't have the ammunition
 and i said two things
 i never want to hear a president
 right
 we never want to have a president hear that again nor do we want a president to have to go through the crap that we were going through back then
 but another thing we did which to me is such an incredible thing to have done
 it's such an honor
 so our last us armed forces the last branch was the air force right
 that was many many decades ago
 we are now building and we have now gotten funding for the sixth branch of the united states armed forces the space force
 so i'll be able to tell my kids someday and everybody else see that space force
 that was my baby
 and you think that was easy
 that's not easy
 because you have democrats that do not like our military
 they do not like our military
 and we did something yesterday because for three years i would see people that run… incredible people the heads of the historically black colleges and universities in the country
 and every year they'd come in and they'd be looking for help
 they needed help and they do need help with it and it's great and they do an incredible job
 so many great schools but they need help
 and every year they'd have to come and come
 i got to know them actually
 i said the only bad thing is you won't see me too much anymore
 because we just provided record funding for a nation's historically black colleges and universities
 and it's longterm they're not going to have to come
 so i said look we could do it where we do it every year or we'll do what we have
 what do you want
 they said let us just have it
 so we'll miss them
 but they are great people
 they've done an incredible job
 and our extraordinary jobs boom which created another 266000 jobs last month and then you add the undercount from the previous two months you're close to 300000 jobs
 and they said if you're a business watcher which i am i love watching business but they said they were guessing could be 70000 could be 80000 maybe 90 maybe 110 somebody said
 then the number comes out 266000 with an adjustment
 remember about four months ago when we had one little period right
 we had one little period where there was a little downturn
 they said oh oh we think we're going into a recession
 i said don't worry about it
 we think we're going into a recession
 they were willing to lose their wealth
 they were willing for this stocks and whatever the hell they own what do you guys own back there
 let it go
 they'll go bust
 they don't care
 anything to get rid of us
 not me us
 and you know what
 then all of a sudden and now for the last couple of weeks we've set brand new records in the history of the various stock markets
 so as of yesterday we've had 133 record days in the stock market now and that's in less than three years
 so when i see that i don't care because i don't… i'm not allowed to have stock
 i can't have stock
 they consider it a conflict of interest and that i can understand
 i agree
 i can
 but you know what
 i'll tell you what
 what i see i see tremendous job growth because we're setting records
 but you know what i also see
 the 401ks where people are up 90 they're up 97 they're up 82
 i tell you the story all the time
 i mean i have people coming up to me and a man came up a policeman
 i've told this story but i've had many so many times but this guy in particular because it was early and that was a year ago
 that was a long time ago
 right now it's much higher than that
 but he said sir i want to thank you
 my wife thinks i'm a loser
 all my life we never did well with the 401ks with stocks
 everything i invested i'm up 72 sir
 she thinks i'm a financial genius
 she's so in love with me
 she so in love
 he said she said ‘darling i think you're one of the greatest investors
 why don't you do this professionally
' and i don't even know what i'm doing sir
 i just have all these stocks
 so i just wanted to tell you i look at a 401k who has 401ks here
 so that's what i see
 i don't care about the rich ones
 i care about everybody
 i care
 i care about everybody actually
 ford motor company just announced that it is investing 1
5 billion dollars into auto factories in the detroit area creating another 3000 michigan jobs
 and that's on top of the many other investments we've gotten from japanese companies car companies and other companies
 but they're all coming in and a lot of them are coming to michigan
 and i say hey go to michigan
 sometimes they'll go south and that's okay whatever
 i want them in this country
 but ideally i want to fill them up
 we're doing so well in michigan with the auto companies
 now you're back
 you're back
 so you're back
 very proud of you
 very proud of you
 but while we're creating jobs fighting for michigan workers and achieving numbers that you've never seen before incredible victories for the american people are happening
 the radical left in congress is consumed with hatred and envy and rage
 you see what's going on
 i'll tell you these people are crazy
 you ever hear it's the economy stupid
 you know that was clinton's saying
 if you have a good economy
 i have the greatest economy in the history of this country and nobody talks about it
 nobody talks about it
 if you're a democrat they say  oh it's the economy… if the economy's any good
 and let me just tell you a little secret
 if crooked hillary would've won your economy would have crashed
 you were going down
 the regulations were taking it down
 the taxes were taking it down instead of being up 92 or whatever you're up a lot you would have been down you would have been at less than half
 it was crashing
 for all those people that would say oh it's the obama… let me tell you something
 you were dying
 and if you look at that first period of a couple of months it was a disaster but it was heading south
 and as sure as you're standing and i'm sorry we couldn't get you seats we didn't have any room
 and by the way 20000 people outside had to leave
 you know
 it's so cold outside we told them don't worry about a screen go home go home and watch
 but we had this is about a 5500 seat arena
 and i said to my people why so small
 are we spoiled
 i watch these guys come in like biden he has a big rally and they get 93 people show up
 no it's true
 i don't understand it
 and did you see the new polls from usa today came out
 i'm killing everybody
 and they hate me
 usa today hates me
 but there's a poll we're beating everybody
 but so biden has this rally they've got 200 seats but only a small number of people
 so you know what they do
 they set up a round table
 so think of these people
 they come in they think they're going to listen to the speech they end up sitting on a round table discussing… they must've been happy right
 we don't have enough room for round tables
 i'm sorry folks
 no they set up a round table but i think we're doing great
 and how do you beat what we've done
 with the economy with our great vets with choice
 you've finally got choice
 they've been trying to get it for almost 50 years
 four more years
 four more years
 four more years
 four more years
 four more years
 four more years
 and these people back here
 your seat or stand is better
 right
 but you know what
 they're going to be much more famous because the cameras can't see you
 they can only see them
 and the other thing the cameras do you ever notice i go to these stadiums 25 30000 people
 they never show the crowd
 you know why
 because they don't want to have… if crazy pocahontas if crazy pocahontas goes to the middle of central park or whatever
 she's in manhattan
 you got me
 and people i mean i could have i could have baron trump go into central park and he'd get a crowd that would be just as… he's 13
 he'd get a bigger crowd
 but if she has the crowd oh these crowds are so big
 i've had crowds over the last couple of weeks
 we went to different pennsylvania florida
 but i mean thousands and thousands of people can't get into these nba arenas right
 big arenas
 and we set records at everyone because we use the floor
 thank you
 i appreciate it
 but we use the floor right
 the basketball court
 so we set records at every arena
 they never even mention the crowds
 they never mention the crowds
 it's sort of amazing
 you know what
 i don't think we've ever had an empty seat from the time i came down the escalator
 that's a long time ago
 i don't think we've ever had an empty seat
 now what the crooked media does though if you got like over here look how packed it is and there's thousands outside but i… please go home
 you're going to catch pneumonia
 but here's the thing
 if this man and that beautiful woman happened to get up because they want to go to the bathroom those cameras will turn to those two seats and they'll say trump wasn't able to fill up the arena
 i always get nervous when i see some… i know they're coming back
 nobody ever leaves our speeches
 because is there a better place to be in the world than a trump rally
 but every time i see a man get up i see a beautiful woman with a baby and they're getting up
 the baby's going crazy and they're getting up
 they're going to take it… but i know they're going to be right back
 and i say fill those two seats
 i don't want them to see it
 because they'll say couldn't fill up the arena
 these are truly dishonest people
 after three years of sinister witch hunts hoaxes scams tonight the house democrats are trying to nullify the ballots of tens of millions of patriotic americans
 capped off with one of the greatest election evenings in history
 was that the greatest
 remember when they all said remember when they all said no no
 you can't win michigan
 you can't
 then i went i did one in grand rapids right
 grand rapids
 we had 32000 people that night
 it was one o'clock in the morning
 that means it was election day when i started speaking
 hillary barack obama michelle obama and bill clinton they did an emergency trip
 they did an emergency trip to michigan at six o'clock
 they got here at prime time
 they started to speak
 she had 500 people
 i got here at one o'clock in the morning the next day which is now election day
 how many people were there
 32000 people outside inside
 it was the last speech of michigan
 and they say well sir it's very hard to win michigan
 i said why would it be hard
 here's the beautiful thing
 everything i told you i've done but much more so
 i said i was going to bring car companies back
 i said i was going to bring in… i just hope you people know that
 i just hope you know it
 but i'll never forget that night
 and in all fairness to bill clinton he used to be a friend of mine until i ran for office
 i like him i like him
 but he told you know the way they tried to shut him out right
 because he's a pro
 he's an instinct guy right
 he's instinct
 he doesn't need… right
 because he's a pro
 he's an instinct guy right
 he's instinct
 he doesn't need polling companies
 who the hell wants him
 you know if you want a polling company pick up the newspaper
 the problem is the newspaper polls are more fake than the news they write
 they write fake polls
 it's true they write fake polls
 you call them suppression polls
 you read them and you get depressed because it looks like you're doing badly
 they do that
 i think it's almost worse than what they write and you can't get much worse than what they write
 so what happens is bill clinton said to crooked hillary his very dishonest wife crooked hillary
 do you think he calls her crooked hillary
 he might
 maybe he just calls her crooked
 he said crooked i'm telling you
 crooked i don't like what i'm seeing in michigan
 i don't like what i'm seeing in wisconsin
 he said i took the trip to wisconsin and i'll tell you what they had those trumppence signs all the way to the convention area every lawn every loan
 i don't like wisconsin
 and then he said oh don't worry about it
 what the hell does he know
 they told him what do you know
 remember they shut him out at the … they didn't want him talking
 he was right
 i mean i don't want to cause any problems in the family but he was right
 but he talked about wisconsin
 then he talked about michigan
 he said crooked i'm telling you crooked i don't like what i'm seeing in michigan
 i was in michigan and i'm telling you they had those damn signs
 i saw some houses where they had four of them on one lawn and two of them on the car
 and he said you horrible human being
 you'd better start listening to me because you're going to get your ass whooped
 and you know what happened
 you know what happened
 she didn't listen fortunately
 and she didn't come to michigan enough
 and she didn't come to wisconsin i think at all right
 because her polling data looked good
 it looked good to me too
 every time i went there with these crowds
 so we won wisconsin
 we won michigan and the great ronna mcdaniel … where is ronna
 where is ronna
 ronna she was so horrible
 i didn't know her ronna mcdaniel and she was so aggressive
 she kept calling and said could you please come out to michigan
 i said who the hell are you
 and i said what do you mean another trip
 so anyway i made we had these big crowds
 i made it again
 then finally i said two weeks out i said ronna no more
 we're going to win it or we're not
 okay
 00 in the evening for this final deal in grand rapids
 sir could you come to michigan tonight
 and i thought i was just about finished
 i went to a last great state and i said it's over
 now i sit back and i watch and let's see what happens right
 but she said could you come to michigan
 i said that is the most aggressive human being i've ever met
 and we did it
 and we won michigan
 and the word is that we're much higher right now in the polls than we were ever in 2016 in michigan
 you better remember when you walk into … you know it's november 3rd this time november 3rd
 by the way though that evening that incredible evening in november one of the biggest nights in the history of television
 you never hear them say it so i might as well
 that election … and my debates … you see their debates are dying
 who wants to watch buttigieg buttigieg
 buttigieg
 you know that you pronounce it they say … i heard some guy saying no no because it's an unpronounceable name
 that's why they call him mayor pete right
 mayor pete
 mayor pete
 mayor pete
 i've had you up to here mayor pete
 no buttigieg is leading
 how does … no you say it this way
 you say it … they call him mayor pete because nobody can pronounce his last name
 that's the only … people think it says … by the way you know what
 i'm not going to say bad things about him
 you know why
 i'd love him to win
 i thought i knocked off pocahontas
 i did it a year too early a year too early
 i give her credit she then started to come back
 i don't think she's going to make it though
 she's gasping
 she's gasping for air
 but i saw them pronouncing buttigieg and they said here's what you do boot edge edge
 say edge like the edge of a building
 edge edge buttigieg
 alfred e
 newman
 you got to be older to know what that means
 but congressional democrats are directly attacking 2
3 million michigan voters who rose up in 2016 won the state and now the democrats are very upset
 they want to get michigan back
 they just don't know how to do it because they didn't do a thing for michigan
 they didn't do anything for michigan
 all they did was take away your companies and let them go to mexico and other places
 you know i don't know if you know it mexico has 32 of your car business
 you know that right
 not because of me
 they're not moving
 but mexico has … 32 of our car business moved to mexico
 can you believe this
 before i got there but that's what i used to talk about
 i said when i was honored that night i said how do you let this happen
 how do you let all these companies leave
 it used to go … it's probably maybe the single biggest reason i ran for president
 it might be the … and i had a lot of them
 immigration i had a lot of them but that may be the single biggest
 with today's illegal unconstitutional and partisan impeachment the do nothing democrats and they are do nothing … all they want to do is focus on this what they could be doing … are declaring their deep hatred and disdain for the american voter
 this lawless partisan impeachment is a political suicide march for the democrat party
 have you seen my polls in the last four weeks
 it's crazy
 it's crazy
 you know why
 because people we have an election right down the road
 i announced three months ago that i'm running right
 i'll give you a little clue
 i announced because i figured once i announce they'd never impeach nobody would be so stupid
 but they'd been trying to impeach me from day one
 they've been trying to impeach me from before i ran okay
 because if you remember when i ran i went immediately to number one never came off number one
 we had center stage from day one in the debates
 so we had i don't know 14 15 debates
 we had a total of 18 actually
 people forgot there was one that they never talk about it but that's okay
 but we had 18 people and i was center stage
 and i said wait a minute this is no good
 i want odd numbers because of your center stage if you have a 10 that means two people are in the middle
 so i said make it 11 or make it nine or i'm not showing up
 and generally they did it because we were way ahead from the beginning
 but i made a lot of great friends out of that group and many of them are good friends today
 although you wouldn't know it based on the … they say that was the meanest … that was a pretty mean primary you got to say
 wasn't that fun
 i liked it
 through their depraved actions today crazy nancy pelosi's house democrats have branded themselves with an eternal mark of shame and it really is
 it's a disgrace
 democrat lawmakers do not believe you have the right to select your own president
 they think that the washington swamp which we believe it or not it ain't easy because they got so much stacked including these guys
 you know what
 these guys are apart of the democrat party
 they are a part of it
 you might as well call them democrats
 you know it's owned by commicast
 they're just as bad as cnn or they're just as bad as msnbc
 and by the way cnn and msnbc their ratings are down the tubes
 it's great
 i love it
 i love it
 but they think the washington swamp should be able to veto the results of an election
 that's what they think
 there's never been a time like this
 think of it you have the greatest economy in the history of the world
 other countries come to see me all of their leaders and they say sir  first thing sir congratulations on your economy
 we're trying to do the same thing
 congratulations sir
 and these guys don't like talking about it
 and if they do they say obama did it
 oh obama obama
 remember obama said you will never be president
 he will never be president
 then remember he said i will consider it a personal front if you allow him to be president
 and then i became president
 he wasn't so happy
 and in all fairness he campaigned harder than crooked hillary because he had more strength
 i mean i go to these places secret service they take me
 i haven't seen a lobby in three years
 it's true
 i go through basements
 i pass compactor plants
 i know more about compactors from this job
 i don't see lobbies
 i say fellows you think you could ever maybe take me through a lobby
 no sir
 but i'll tell you what
 i go upstairs downstairs all around
 they're taking me up three flights go down one
 i said are we almost there
 yes sir another four flights
 and i say you think hillary could do this
 i don't think so
 they'd bring her back home
 she wants to go to sleep
 and now i hear she wants to run again
 wouldn't that be great
 oh
 thank you
 thank you
 oh would we love that
 you think the democrats are screwed up
 wait until that happens
 wouldn't that be … oh there's my guy
 lock her up
 lock her up
 lock her up
 well look based on the fbi report you just saw what happened with the ig where they came out with the fbi
 based on that you know what
 i never stopped you
 but now think of what they did
 think of what they did
 think of how dishonest it all was
 they shouldn't even be allowed to have an impeachment because it was based on dishonesty
 it was based on illegality
 she went out and they paid for a fake dossier
 they gave money to foreigners to write a fake dossier totally disproven totally fake
 the fbi then took that fake dossier and they used it in the fisa court to get approval to spy on my campaign
 and if we were democrats they would've been in jail two years ago
 it's a disgrace
 think of what they did
 so they use this fake dossier and they brought it before this big deal court
 it's a big deal the fisa court
 and they said this stuff and they lied about it because comey who's another beauty … did i do a great job when i fired his ass
 what a great job
 oh no they had bad plans
 no i did a great thing
 that was like throwing a rock at a hornet's nest
 did that place explode
 and then we learned about lisa page and her wonderful lover peter strzok
 i love you lisa
 i love you more than anybody in the world
 i love you more than anybody in the world
 it causes problems with the wife but we won't talk about that
 those tapes didn't work well
 no how about those statements right
 and then they say in all fairness … i really liked the report but how does the inspector general say … because don't forget he was appointed by obama
 so i'm not knocking him because he gave us a lot of nuggets but we had a lot of those nuggets
 how does the inspector general say you have these horrible … he's going to lose
 isn't he
 he's going to lose or she's going to win 100 million
 did you see all the zeros
 it was like … i'm blinking
 i says i think it's 100
 he's going to lose 100 to one
 isn't he peter
 i love you so much peter
 i've never loved anyone like you
 he's going to lose 100 million to one peter right
 that's right
 he's going to lose 100 million to one
 but there's no bias
 how about the insurance policy
 to me the greatest
 just in case she loses we have an insurance policy
 we're in the insurance policy right now folks
 we've been in it for three years that's what they meant
 i mean the insurance policy is on an artificial respirator because we're doing awfully well
 and i'll tell you something rush limbaugh said it
 sean hannity said it
 laura ingram said it
 tucker said it
 ainsley said it but a lot of people have said it
 they said there's nobody in the world that could have handled that stuff that happened and still created one of the greatest economies and done more than any other president ever before in the first three years
 i understand that
 i understand that but it's my life very unfair to my family
 i have to say this very very unfair to my family
 what they put my family through is a disgrace
 me it's my life
 it's fine
 i do
 but you know what
 what they put my family through is a disgrace and they ought to be ashamed and we should get apologies all over the place
 so yesterday i sent pelosi a letter denouncing and condemning her party's outrageous abusive power
 that's what it is
 they have nothing
 they're the ones that should be impeached every one of them
 i mean you got this guy schiff
 he makes up a statement and he goes in front of congress where he has immunity and he makes up a statement from me that's totally fictitious totally out of thin air
 the worst statement i've ever heard
 many people saw it
 i had a person two weeks ago that said i didn't love the statement you made
 i said really
 didn't you read the transcripts
 i always say read the transcript
 but didn't you read it no no
 i heard it on television
 i watched adam schiff
 he made it up
 i then sent him the transcript
 he said oh now i feel better
 that's perfect
 i call it perfect
 he called it perfect
 everyone calls it if you read it
 but here's the thing
 he makes up this statement and it finished
 didn't he have eight quid pro quos
 eight
 could you imagine you're dealing with a country and you say eight times that you've got to do something
 the first time they say well
 the second time they say that's strange
 third time they say what's wrong
 you said eight times
 eight times
 they'd have you arrested
 they'd have you put into an insane asylum
 but he actually said … i think he said eight not seven eight
 and then he finished with don't call me i'll call you
 can you imagine
 the president of the united states don't call me i'll call you
 you know what that is
 that's a mafia statement okay
 that's the head of the mafia saying don't call me
 this guy actually said that and then he walked away and people became incensed because they knew that wasn't the people that read the thing
 most people believed him
 he's a liar
 because you know he's a corrupt politician 100
 no he's a corrupt … and then i see him
 by the way you ever see this guy
 he walks up to the mics
 i mean we're not … all fairness look i don't want to be … because with me too i never even think about looks anymore okay
 i don't talk about looks of a male or a female but in his case let's just say … the last time i'll ever refer to this
 he's not exactly the best looking guy we've ever seen
 no any mic
 he walks up to the mic and he's so just this is a sad sad day for america
 our president is an employee of russia
 i have absolute proof that the president this is at the beginning and every week they'd say where's the proof
 it's coming
 it's coming
 then we get the mueller report nothing
 and i'll tell you what i know some of the people in this audience
 if i spent not 45 million not 18 trump haters i call them the angry democrats
 it was 13 then it went to 18 and then mueller
 did muller do a good job
 did he do a good job
 no
 boo
 how was his performance in front of congress
 boo
 not the best but think of this 45 million they spent
 and you know i heard somebody say well we got back some of that money
 let me tell you you cost this country billions and billions and billions of dollars in all of the things that didn't get done in all of the embarrassment to our country
 you caused billions and billions of dollars and it was a hoax
 but this guy schiff i have absolute proof
 i have this
 i have that this that
 anytime he sees a camera and he's stone faced stone faced
 he's a pathological liar
 he gets up and i've never seen anything like it
 even i was saying i wonder what he has
 what does he have
 he says i have absolute i said i haven't spoken to russia in year
 what the hell do i have to do with russia
 but this guy gets up … oh i think we have a vote coming in
 haleigh
 wow
 thank you haleigh great job
 wow
 the republican party has never been so affronted but they've never been so united as they are right now ever never
 and i know the senators and they're great guys and women too
 we have some great women
 we have great guys
 they're great people
 they love this country
 they're going to do the right thing
 they're going to do the right thing
 so i said in my letter to pelosi … i love that
 you know usually there's one two
 the republicans look i've said it for a long time
 the democrats are lousy politicians they really are
 they've got horrible policies open borders crime is fine drugs pouring through
 i mean think of what they do
 sanctuary cities they love sanctuary cities
 they're lousy politicians but they have one thing … two things
 they are vicious
 they're the most vicious people
 the republicans aren't as vicious
 they may learn to be vicious after going through this though
 but the other thing the democrats always stick together
 now think of it three democrats went over to our side no republicans
 it's unheard of
 and by the way this is for a hundred years
 i'm not just talking about this little point in time
 the republicans are known as it's always harder to stick together
 these people are great
 we have a great republican party and we have to get that change
 we have to take back the house
 you'll have the greatest healthcare ever if we take … and by the way we had another victory
 the individual mandate just a little while ago it came over the wires it was just upheld
 the individual mandate is now gone
 the most unpopular part of obamacare
 it was just upheld
 so i said in my letter to pelosi by proceeding with your invalid impeachment you're violating your oath of office
 you're breaking your allegiance to the constitution
 you're declaring open war on american democracy
 you dare to invoke the founding fathers in pursuit of this election nullification scheme yet your spiteful actions display unfettered contempt for america's founding and your egregious conduct
 and listen though it's so true it threatens to destroy what our founders pledged and in fact their very lives to build
 you are the ones interfering in america's elections
 you are the one subverting america's democracy
 we did nothing wrong nothing whatsoever
 this was just an excuse
 you are the ones that are obstructing justice
 you are the ones bringing pain and suffering to our republic for your own selfish personal political and partisan gain
 they're bringing pain
 the work we could be doing on lowering drug prices on getting rid of these horrible horrible situations
 you know in the border … the woman is okay
 is she okay
 okay thank you very much
 thank you
 i mean some of these people are waiting here for three days right
 thank you
 they'll come back
 come back
 merry christmas
 thank you
 merry christmas is true
 but what they've done with this perversion it's perversion
 and when you watch some of these people get up and speak today they don't even … you have violated the constitution
 well what does he done wrong
 well we don't know that
 they don't even have any crime
 this is the first impeachment where there's no crime
 i say tell me what i did please
 well we don't know
 you violated the constitution
 you had turley who's smart alan dershowitz these guys
 all of them they said there's no crime
 there's no crime right
 there's no crime
 there's no crime
 i'm the first person that ever get impeached and there's no crime
 i feel guilty
 you know what they call it
 impeachment light
 it's impeachment light
 that's why with richard nixon i just see it as a very dark era very dark very … oh you don't even like to think
 i don't know about you but i'm having a good time it's crazy
 but i also know we have a great group of people behind us in the republican party we really do
 maybe i wouldn't feel the same way but we have a great group of people behind us
 we had in the house and we have it in the senate
 they're doing a great job so i'm not worried
 i'm not worried because it's always good when you don't do anything wrong you get impeached
 that may be a record that will last forever
 but you know what they have done
 they've cheapened the impeachment process
 and now anybody that become … this is a sacred position
 anybody that becomes president i mean they could have a phone call and they get impeached
 so if the republicans … if you had a democrat as president we have a republican house they don't like the guy for whatever reason or the woman they impeach the person
 it's cheapened it
 it's exactly what our founding fathers didn't want and they said it could happen and it's happened
 but i know one thing americans will show up by the tens of millions next year to vote pelosi the hell out of office
 but it's so disappointing
 i see a woman carolyn maloney
 she's a long time nothing much believe me
 she's a congresswoman from manhattan the east side
 i was with her
 her first race i helped her
 she was always so nice oh thank you thank you
 i made lots of contributions over the years
 in new york if you're not a … it's purely democrat especially in manhattan
 so what happens
 i make lots of contributions for years and years and years
 i go run
 the first person i see carolyn maloney
 i raise my hand to impeach
 well give me back the damn money that i've been paying her for so many years
 let her pay me back all the money
 let her pay me back all the money
 then you have this dingell
 dingell you know dingell from michigan
 you know dingell
 you ever hear of her michigan
 debbie dingell that's a real beauty
 so she calls me up like eight months ago
 her husband was here a long time but i didn't give him the b treatment
 i didn't give him the c or the d
 i could've
 nobody what is you know
 i gave the a+ treatment
 take down the flags
 while you're taking them down for ex-congressman dingell … oh okay
  … do this do that do that rotunda everything
 i gave him everything
 that's okay
 i don't want anything for it
 i don't need anything for anything
 she calls me up
 it's the nicest thing that's ever happened
 thank you so much
 john would be so thrilled
 he's looking down
 he'd be so thrilled
 thank you so much sir
 i said that's okay don't worry about it
 maybe he's looking up
 i don't know
 i don't know
 maybe maybe
 but let's assume he's looking down
 but i gave him a+ not a not b+ not b
 i gave him the a+ and she called me
 she said oh no
 i won't go into the conversation because it's not fair do that
 but all i want to say is let's put it this way it was the most profuse thank you that you could ever get on a scale of zero to 10 it was a 10
 okay so that was what
 february or something
 now they talk about this phony impeachment and she's out there well we have to look seriously at our president because he may have violated the constitution of the united states
 boo
 and i can't be happy with that because i love our country
 i love this and i love that
 she loves everything
 i said she's a no okay
 no but i look at her and she's so sincere and what happens
 i vote to impeach trump
 and you know what
 i didn't say who the hell knew this was even going to come up
 i went through the whole muller hoax
 they did this big report
 i was totally exonerated
 they didn't even bring it up at the impeachment because i was totally exonerated
 if they saw one little kernel one little quarter of a sentence … look what they did with one word
 remember this what did i do
 why did i do
 it's us
 but they don't say it that way
 they say i
 they read it totally different schiff and his band of thieves they read it
 now i say basically very simple do us a favor our country
 do us
 do us
 not me
 our country
 and then what do i say
 i say the united states attorney general attorney general of the united states could speak to you it would be great okay
 because it's known for major corruption
 in fact the new leader of ukraine got in on a construction … on a platform where he looks for all of the problems of dishonesty and everything that was going on in ukraine right
 he looked for it that's how he got into office
 he got into office that way
 so we take it and they repeat it a thousand times and they never say with the right … so i go wild and we start
 and the republicans have got it right
 now we always correct him but i use the word us
 us is the united states our country
 and then it actually says i think comma country but they don't say that
 they say do me a favor
 how many times have you heard it
 where they say in a speech
 and then the president said do me a favor
 well that's not what i said
 i said do us a favor our country
 and then i said the attorney general of the united states i didn't say my campaign- i said the attorney general of the united states i didn't say my campaign manager
 okay
 i said the attorney … and these people want to impeach the president of the united states for that
 oh and then what happened
 right
 then what happened
 so then the president of ukraine who's a quality person said there was no pressure exerted whatsoever
 that was a killer for the democrats right
 then his foreign minister said the same thing
 he said there was no pressure exerted whatsoever
 there was no pressure
 that's a killer
 so now did you see what the democrats did a couple of days ago
 they tried to say that he's not a strong person that he was weak
 they used the word weak that he was weak and under the power of trump he said
 do you know how insulting that is
 anybody that becomes president of a country and that's a big country and it's a tough country you got to be tough
 he's tough
 but so what they're saying now is he was weak because the wording it just doesn't fit
 okay
 these are really dishonest people
 and if the press was fair this thing never would have happened
 so the house democrats are surrendering their majority their dignity their reputations
 they look like a bunch of fools
 and i'll tell you we have a lot of new stars in the republican party i could read off a list of 20 names
 but they're giving up their honor and they'll receive a big backlash at the box office
 when you take a look that ballot box that ballot box on november 3rd i think we're going to have crowds like we've never had
 and i'll tell you something it used to be they'd always say oh the republicans
 you know in 2018 i didn't run
 i didn't run right
 they all said oh we didn't
 well actually we picked up two seats in the senate that these guys never talk about
 we just approved 171 federal court justices 171 federal justices including courts of appeal 171
 we'll be up probably by the end of the year to 182 and for that i thank president obama
 he gave me 142 openings
 he gave me 142
 i said to him my people i got there because they say the most important thing you could do as a president is judges and supreme court
 we have two great supreme court judges
 right
 two justices of the supreme court kavanaugh gorsuch
 two great men
 they're great
 and how about the pain that they put justice kavanaugh through right
 over a phony deal i hate to tell you
 over a phony deal
 what a disgrace what they put that man through and that family through
 just remember it come november
 you got to remember it's a long time
 you know in the life of trump 10 months is an eternity
 it's a long time
 somebody said congratulations sir you're going to win
 i said don't say that
 just don't talk about it
 let's always pretend you're one point down
 like last time
 going to be close
 nope it's going to be close
 but what they put that man through was horrible what they put his family through was horrible
 and you know those stories largely have been recanted
 and frankly the ones that didn't recant i don't know what a supreme court judge does but he should sue them
 he should sue them
 so we want to take back the house we'll hold the senate and we'll keep the white house
 you will have the greatest healthcare
 you will continue with the greatest judges
 you know we have judges that are … we just had a great story in the wall street journal
 i have to be always very truthful because if i'm a little bit off they call me a liar
 they'll say he gets a pinocchio the stupid washington post they have pinocchio
 i mean even if you're saying things perfectly it's a pinocchio
 there's nothing you can say where you don't get a pinocchio
 but what happens what happens is we have wall street journal the other day got the best story
 they said whether you like him or not the job he's done on judges and supreme court justices but the job he's done on judges is amazing
 say it's the most important thing
 see i don't agree
 i say defense is the most the military is the most
 but once you're beyond the military i mean to me defense is the most important
 because without good defense maybe we don't need judges so much right
 it's like somebody said well we violated the budget
 i said do me a favor don't worry about the budget
 if we're attacked and aren't doing very well and somebody says ‘well at least we have a good budget' that doesn't work too well
 right
 that doesn't work
 so we have great military we have great judges we have great everything
 drug prices down
 for the first time in 51 years drug prices came down
 and that was with no help from the democrats
 if they helped because you need their votes if they helped i could get those drug prices down 40 and 50
 okay
 and we just approved and we're approving very soon for the governor of florida ron desantis where he can buy he has the right to go we're giving him the right to go and buy from a foreign country where the prices for the identical drug identical drug are 50 less
 he's going to do that for the people of florida
 and we're going to do that for your governors if they want to do that
 we'll get that down so far
 everyone in america can see straight through the washington democrats' phony dangerous charade
 schiff makes up so many things
 pelosi makes it up and she backs him up
 i saw her on a television show and george stephanopoulos that's another beauty he said even he said he was defending me
 i couldn't believe it
 he made this statement but you know he lied on that
 he made up this stuff
 no he didn't he didn't
 so that means nancy pelosi said no the statement that he made up
 but it's all going to end soon and it's going to come out to a beautiful great victory for the republican party and for this nation
 thank you very much
 so that's it
 we have the greatest country
 we've turned around a ship
 we need four more years
 if we don't have it … now if you want to drive them crazy we had one group in pennsylvania some guy started screaming  16 more years
 16
 they went crazy
 and you know what they don't understand
 when i do get out they're all going to go out of business
 they're making more money than they've ever made
 that crazy new york times one of the worst newspapers in the world one of the most dishonest newspapers in the history of the world totally phony
 they came out with a story where it was a great headline for me and the people that read it the super radical left they called and complained so much that they changed the headline and took it from positive to negative on a good story
 can you believe it
 no they're among the most dishonest people
 but i'll never forget before i took that great escalator ride down with our first lady … our first lady is doing a great job great job
 i said first lady you're so lucky i took you on this journey this wonderful beautiful journey
 and it is
 you know why it's a wonderful beautiful journey
 because look at what we're accomplishing is unbelievable
 it's unprecedented
 it is unprecedented what we're accomplishing
 you're so lucky i said it to all my people
 i have great people in the back
 i say you folks are so lucky i took you on this
 you could be home right now relaxing
 but i'd rather be here frankly than any place
 these rallies are great
 they're inspiring
 you are inspiring
 and you know it's funny we're not even into election season
 yeah it's a long way away
 we're not even in it
 and yet i think the enthusiasm right now is greater than it was even before the 2016 election
 does that make any sense
 i think a lot of it has to do with a witch hunt
 a lot of it has to do with the phony witch hunt because you're smart people
 you're the elite
 they're not the elite
 you're the elite
 you're the elite
 you do better than they do
 they talk about it don't you hate it
 well the elite …  oh really
 i went to better schools
 many of you went to better schools
 we won't talk about homes even though your homes are nicer
 we won't talk about jobs
 you see the jobs reports
 you see what's happening
 do you see where wages are going up
 you know when i first started when i was here one of my first speeches i was talking that people made more money that was four years ago so it was 20 years before that so that's 24 25 years ago
 they made more money 24 years ago than they were making when i got elected president
 and they worked one job versus two or three jobs
 now it's going up beautifully and we want that the salaries
 and you know the number one group of people that are going up is the blue collar worker
 it's percentage the best
 the blue collar worker
 they had two and three jobs
 the blue collar worker is going up the most
 anyway so you know what else
 the thing i'm happiest about african american unemployment the lowest in the history of our country
 african american
 remember i used to say you remember look at you
 are you the greatest guy
 everyone thinks do i pay
 i'm telling you i have a group of african american guys and gals by the way that follow me around and they think i pay them and i don't
 i love them they love me
 they come
 how many rallies have you come to
 a lot
 they're great people just great
 thank you
 i don't even know who the hell he is
 is that right
 i don't know him but i like him
 i see him at so many rallies
 i appreciate it
 you and your group they're great people
 thank you
 so you're obviously doing well if you can travel around like that right
 ah he knows
 i appreciate it i really do
 i think it's fantastic
 thank you
 thank you
 but think of this african-american unemployment is the lowest it's ever been in the history of our country
 their poverty levels they had a horrible poverty level in the negative sense now their poverty levels are the best they've ever been in the history of our country
 same with hispanic americans the best unemployment numbers and employment numbers
 and the same with asians the best unemployment
 and women i'm sorry 71 years best in 71 years
 i've let the women down
 but i think within another couple of months you'll be historical
 so only 71 years best
 the best in 71 years
 but what we're doing has been an incredible thing
 it's an incredible thing
 when i'm on the debate stage with one of these characters and they try and say negative stuff i'll just say well here's the story
 in the history of our country this group is doing the best and that group is doing the best and the women are doing the best and everybody's doing
 and frankly you know what it is
 the whole country's doing the best
 okay
 the whole country is doing the best
 so we have records and everything and yet they're trying to and they really are i've never seen anything like it they're accusing me really of doing what joe biden … biden admitted what he did
 how about this
 they protect him
 did you see the crummy debate
 those debates are so boring
 they're dying in the ratings
 they're dying they're dying
  while it's totally unsupported
 what's unsupported
 he's on tape saying that he's holding back 1 billion from ukraine unless you change the prosecutor
 how about that question
 i won't say who answered because you know i'm not i actually used to like the guy he was a nice guy to me but now i don't like him so much but that's okay
 but he goes while it's totally unsubstantiated and while we beg your mercy that we're asking you even to bring up this question but president trump said you refused to give 1 billion of taxpayer money to ukraine unless they get the prosecutor to stop looking at your son and your son's company
 and sleepy joe gives a sleepy answer and that's the end of it
 that's it
 then whenever i bring it up do you ever notice they always use  while these charges are totally unsubstantiated
 he's on tape
 if that were me it's the electric chair
 they would bring the electric chair back
 no the guy's on tape and they always say it's unsubstantiated
 it is not supported by fact one of them the other day they finally changed the word
 it is supported by fact
 no it's supported by tape
 no it's unbelievable
 in many ways i'd like to have him win because number one he's going to have to eventually answer that question and number … she said he doesn't know where he is
 that's the other problem
 now i've been doing this for a long time and i have much bigger crowds than anybody's ever had in history
 by the way do you know what
 i say it against the fake news because you know what they're going to say
 every stadium is packed
 i give my people one instruction get the largest stadium you can get
 now that's why i was a little surprised
 but in battle creek you don't have that many right
 not too many stadiums
 but i wanted to be here
 you know why i wanted to be here
 first of all the crowd is incredible
 the crowd outside
 but let me tell you
 no you know why i wanted to be here
 because we have a lot of choices but i wanted to be here because this area supported me so overwhelmingly and i said i want to be there
 pretty simple pretty simple
 pretty simple
 i wanted to be here for that reason and i just want to say thank you because i'll tell you what you came in … i don't know i didn't get 100 but we got a damn good percentage right
 we got a damn good percentage
 so it's really thrilling to be here
 but we're joined tonight by many terrific republican leaders
 your michigan house speaker lee chatfield
 where's lee
 lee come up if you want
 come on what the hell we have nothing else to do
 should we get him up
 yes
 come up lee come up lee get up here

 now we're going to win it by so much you better remember all those
 every time a car plant opens please think about trump
 come on up here lee
 michigan gop chairwoman laura cox

 hate to tell you but all your congressmen you know where they are right now

 they had a choice sir should we leave and be there
 i said don't leave

 that's why we got that vote
 that's some vote right lee
 the chairman of the woman's workers and workers for trump and a proud union autoworker terry bowman who's been so terrific
 thank you terry
 come on up
 and while democrats are obsessed with impeachment we're focused on jobs jobs jobs
 this group local leaders
 and all your washington folks they are right where they have to be in washington tonight
 thank you
 thank you
 great job
 thank you very much
 we've eliminated more job-killing regulations than any administration in the history of our country whether it's four years or eight years or in one case much more than eight years
 in a period of two and a half years we have eliminated more regulations than any other president by far
 you're saving almost 3000 a year because of regulation cuts
 total income gains for median households will reach 10000 a family
 i'll give you a couple of quick numbers
 so under president bush for eight years you saved 450 meaning you took in 450 bucks
 okay fine
 under president obama you took in 975
 under president trump including the energy savings and the regulation savings and the tax cut savings it's more than 10000 in less than three years
 pretty good right
 so for two eight-years you had a 400 450 and a 975
 that's eight years
 450
 in less than three years you had more than 10000
 that goes right into your pockets
 it's one of the reasons our economy is doing well because as they say the consumer is doing better than they've ever done
 and that's great that's what we wanted
 we've ended the war on american energy and the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas on planet earth
 and these maniacs want to close it up
 how about going to texas
 you know beto
 what
 remember what he said i said oh this guy's a loser
 you know a salesman like if you're a great salesman you never talk that you're a great salesman
 you don't walk in and say well i'm a great salesman
 i can sell …  any guy that does that they're no good
 it's those quiet type that get you
 you know the ones that don't talk
 so beto when he first got in remember this clown
 he gets in no no he gets in
 i was made for this job to run for president
 after about two weeks they killed him
 he was gone
 but you remember he was against the bible he was against religion he was against guns and he was against oil and gas
 and he comes from texas
 i said that's a platform
 think of it
 he's against religion he's against guns and against oil and gas
 think of it
 i don't like to bring it up because he's gone zone but he comes from texas
 i said abraham lincoln can't win in texas with that platform
 but they are all of them they want to close up your energy
 it's a big deal
 they want to close up your steel mills
 they don't want your steel mills
 look at what i've done for steel
 i mean the steel is back
 we taxed all of the dump steel coming in from china and other places and your steel mills that are doing great they're expanding all over the country
 and they were going to be out of business within two years
 the way they were going they were gone
 united states steel is spending now billions of dollars on expansions
 every major democrat running for president has pledged to eliminate gas powered automobiles and destroy the u
s
 auto industry forever
 and you know why
 because they have these maniacs that say you got to go all electric
 i want to have an alternative a big alternative
 you're going to always have the alternative
 and a lot of people don't know of the electric can ever catch the gas you know
 and by the way there'll be different forms of energy coming along
 but they want to close them up and we're not closing them up
 we're going to have lots of alternatives so that you can have it from a pricing you can have it for a lot of different reasons
 we're even bringing back the old light bulb
 you heard about that right
 the old light bulb which is better
 i say why do i always look so orange
 you know why
 because of the new light they're terrible
 you look terrible
 they cost you many many times more like four or five times more
 and you know they're considered hazardous waste
 when a light bulb is out you've got to bring it to a dump
 so let's say over here in battle creek where's your nearest dump
 okay that's what a couple of hundred miles away
 so every time you lose … drive a couple of hundred miles right
 i said how many people do that
 nobody
 what do they do
 they throw it in the garbage
 but you know what it is because it's all gas
 it's much more expensive four or five times more
 and i came into office i did a lot of this
 sinks showers all of this stuff i did a lot of it
 no water comes out
 you have areas where there's so much water you don't know what to do with it
 you turn on the shower you're not allowed to have any water anymore
 i mean we do a lot of it
 dishwashers we did the dishwasher right
 you press it
 remember the dishwasher you'd press it boom there'd be like an explosion five minutes later you open it up the steam pours out the dishes
 now you press it 12 times the women tell me again
 you know they give you four drops of water and they're in places where there's so much water they don't know what to do with it
 so we just came out with a reg on dishwashers
 we're going back to the old
 by the way by the time they press it 10 times you spend more on water and electric
 don't forget the whole thing is worse because you're spending all that money on electric
 so we're bringing back standards that are great and better machinery that you can have the water again right
 but with the light bulb i said what's going on with the light bulbs
 a lot of people are complaining about the cost
 so i had a couple of experts come in i said tell me what gives a better light
 well we liked the old light bulb better
 i said i like it better
 and so what i did is you can have either one
 if you want to buy the newer kind you can
 and if you want to look very handsome or beautiful by buying the older kind like i do
 so we're bringing back the old light bulb
 so it's a much less expensive it probably gives a better light
 but whatever it is and you'll be able to spend a lot less money for a light bulb
 i mean it sounds like little but it's big stuff
 okay
 it's big stuff and we're doing it with a lot of other things our dishwashers
 and you know i won't tell you one of the things because every time i tell you they do a big number on it
 you know the one i'm talking about right
 sinks right
 showers
 and what goes with a sink and a shower
 10 times right
 10 times
 not me of course not me but you him
 but i never mention that because one time i mentioned all three i said sinks showers and toilets
 the headline was trump with the toilets toilets
 that's all they want
 they don't even mention it
 so i didn't mention that okay
 i go off the record
 but you know what
 it's terrible
 you want to wash your hands you turn on the sink no water comes out
 so you leave the water going 10 times as long it's the same thing
 you have a shower drip
 it's no good for me
 for me
 you know the one thing that came out really good about being in this business
 they always used to say i wore a hairpiece
 it's okay
 i know people wear hairpieces
 but they always used to say
 they don't say that anymore because i have been through the worst storms
 if you wear one of those suckers you got to give it up fast because within two weeks they got you
 you look handsome don't worry about it
 but in the last two decades before my election we lost one in five auto manufacturing jobs in this country
 the people are trying to impeach us for doing all of the things that they've wanted to do for so many years
 and that's why it doesn't work
 we look so forward to taking it on and it is all about cleaning the swamp draining the swamp and we have a very very big bad dangerous swamp
 okay that's enough of that
 that's enough
 so among the very first acts that i did was to stop the deal that would have dealt a death blow to the u
s
 auto industry
 i withdrew from the horrible trans pacific partnership
 that would have ended your auto industry
 a lot of people don't know that but i do
 remember tpp
 we were basically ceding our auto industry to these countries that were just going to rip us off
 the people that made these trade deals it's like where do they come
 like the one in korea that was a hillary clinton special
 she said this will produce 250000 new jobs
 and i said well what happened
 he said well she was right
 except it was for south korea not for us
 no it's true
 it produced 250000 jobs for south korea
 these deals were so bad
 but now they're getting really good and some of them are getting great and over a period of time they are going to be phenomenal
 wait till you see the numbers that start coming out of this country over a short period of time
 but we have to go through a little pain because we have to do it and then they all say we're going to withdraw and then i say you can withdraw i don't care
 we're putting tariffs on your country
 then they say we'd love to make a deal sir
 the new usmca has powerful protections to keep auto manufacturing jobs right here in michigan where they belong
 since the election we've created 41000 brand new motor vehicle and parts jobs manufacturing jobs
 remember the statement by president obama
 you'd have to wave a magic wand
 remember the magic wand
 because manufacturing … and i said you know that sounds strange
 what do you do if you don't have manufacturing
 how do you make things
 right
 manufacturing jobs won't happen
 well we've got 600000 manufacturing jobs and you're going to see a big big increase
 the truth is we need more people
 you know what
 we need more people
 we need more people coming into the country and they're going to come in and they're going to come in through merit and they're going to love our country and they're going to respect our country and they're going to work
 we do need more people
 they're opening these massive foxconn in wisconsin they're opening these massive plants and it's hard to get people
 we want people coming in but they have to come in only they have to come in through merit
 fiat-chrysler recently announced a 4
5 billion investment in michigan including the first new auto plant in detroit in more than a generation
 and general motors recently announced a 300 million investment at its orion assembly plant right here in michigan
 come on general motors let's go
 general motors gave us a little hard time with one building
 i wasn't happy about that
 that was the only building i had a problem within the whole car industry right
 right
 you know the one i'm talking about
 i didn't like that
 anyway but they're spending money you know what can i tell you
 but these companies are coming in a lot of the foreign companies are coming because they have to
 i say you have to or we're not trading with you anymore
 because we had such big deficits with these countries
 with japan we had a 68 billion deficit
 i said shinzo he's great prime minister of japan
 but he said but nobody has ever asked us to do this
 i said i'm asking you
 they are building many many plants
 they're building many plants now in the united states the japanese
 and after years of rebuilding foreign nations we are finally rebuilding our nation
 is that okay
 we were surrounded with globalists
 you know they think it's okay
 you open a plant in some country that you never heard of they make your product they send it
 in the meantime they close all their factories here
 we're not doing that anymore
 those are globalists
 they think it's wonderful to have deficits
 i don't
 they think it's great
 it's a great thing to have deficits
 no those are globalists
 the globalists are passe
  our first duty and our one true allegiance is to you the american people before anybody else
 we must care for our own- we must care for our own citizens first democrat immigration policies are resulting in brutal assaults and wicked murders against innocent americans
 i don't even know what's happening
 it's terrible
 and we've moved out thousands and thousands of ms13 thugs out of our country
 and we have agreements now with guatemala honduras el salvador
 they didn't use to take them back
 if we had a murderer then we should get them the hell out
 we don't really want them in our prisons and take care of them for 50 60 years
 we want to bring them back
 they wouldn't take them
 the planes used to go around and around don't land don't land
 with us they land
 we worked out deals with every one of them
 we stopped giving them all the aid
 we're giving them all this money and then they said we're not going to let you land
 we're not going to let you take them back
 i said that's okay
 500 million we were giving them
 i said now we give them 5 we give them nothing
 all of a sudden they said we would love to have them back
 we would love it
 it's wonderful to have them back
 in june two illegal aliens in sandusky michigan were convicted of sadistically beating and stabbing a woman to death with a kitchen knife
 then they hid her body in a water drain
 a criminal alien with two previous deportations was just arrested in michigan and convicted of brutally beating and strangling to death a single mother of five young children
 it's happening all the time
 far left politicians support deadly sanctuary cities which deliberately release dangerous violent criminal aliens out of the jails and directly onto your streets
 we had a great election in north carolina recently two great congressmen got elected you don't hear about it when they win you don't ever hear about it just a few months ago
 two great people and they got elected and they got elected because i went in and said talk about the fact that you have sanctuary cities and they had some horrible crimes happening from those sanctuary cities
 soon as i mentioned that boom they went up like rocket ships and they won their elections and it was great
 great thing
 the sanctuary cities are a disaster and let me tell you the people of california they don't like sanctuary cities either
 they're stuck with them because they have crazy politicians
 earlier this year authorities in the sanctuary jurisdiction of kent county michigan anybody know kent county
 released an illegal alien charged with assault with intent to murder after he repeatedly and viciously stabbed a man in the head with a broken bottle
 they let him go to roam free in michigan communities
 if you want to end sanctuary cities in michigan if you want to protect your families from criminal aliens if you want to have a safe life frankly it's so crazy what they're doing
 you wouldn't even believe it
 you have only one choice in 2020 you must vote republican
 thank you
 i'm surprised
 as you know you do have sanctuary cities in michigan
 i was almost surprised to hear it but you have them
 it's one of those progressive things
 they think they're doing a wonderful favor for the world
 and now we're getting these prosecutors that you murder somebody they give you two months they fight that you don't even have to go to jail
 what's going on is crazy
 thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border illegal crossings are down 75 since may and we've ended catch and release
 we've ended it
 we could've ended it so easily
 it's called the loophole
 you catch him and then you release him into a country
 that's what you had to do by law
 and if you don't do that they arrest the border patrol people
 you believe this
 the border patrol people were in more danger than the criminal aliens coming in and some of these people are not good people
 these are the people because look when you have a caravan of eight or 10000 people a lot of those people do you think that guatemala honduras el salvador do you think they're sending us their finest
 i don't think so
 alright
 how about the lottery
 that was a schumer deal
 chuck schumer crying chuck crying chuck schumer
 i used to be a big contributor to him he used to kiss my ass chuck schumer
 he'd do anything
 he would've done anything for me
 anything i asked him get schumer on the phone you do this you do that
 you get him on the phone that son of a bitch
 he would have done i didn't need anything but he would have done anything
 now it's like the prisoner has not acted-
 give me a break
 give me a break
 find out how much money did i give a raise to chuck schumer and chuck give all that money back please
 carolyn maloney give that money back
 every penny should come back
 they act so pompous
 they act so righteous
 they're not righteous
 they're not righteous
 they're bad people
 the far left democrats have never been more extreme than they are now
 democrats are pushing a socialist takeover of healthcare that will take away your coverage and take away your doctor
 180 million people are going to lose
 a lot of people here now have healthcare finally under us that's phenomenal
 and that's what you want
 they want to take it away 180
 they want you to go to a hospital ward someplace and sit there all night
 i don't think so
 not in this group
 and you know what
 some people it's good so people but can you imagine
 they want to take away 180 million people great private highly negotiated healthcare where you have your own doctor
 remember obama
 28 times you can have your doctor you can have your plan
 didn't work out that way did it
 i think we should impeach him for that
 let's impeach him for that for the irs scandal for the guns
 remember the guns he was giving them to anybody that wanted them
 he gave guns to the worst people in the world and then they didn't have them registered right
 not to good
 impeach him
 why didn't the republicans impeach him
 those were really how about giving around 1
8 billion in cash
 how about that
 by the way i ended the iran nuclear deal
 i hope you happy much different country
 but how about giving iran 1
8 billion in cash
 many big planes going over to iran loaded up to the ceiling with cash
 you know what 1
8 billion you ever see like at a casino 1 million wrapped up
 it's a big pile of stuff that's a million
 now multiply it 1
8 billion in cash he gave
 so why is he allow to do that
 did anybody try to impeach him for that
 everybody knew it was wrong
 republicans will strongly protect patients with preexisting conditions and we will protect your preexisting physicians
 virtually every top democrat also now supports late term abortion ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up until the moment of birth
 right
 that is why i've asked congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift of god
 democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion socialism and blatant corruption
 and that's what it is
 the republican party is the party of the american worker the american family and the american dream
 and that's really what it is
 we're also the party of the great abraham lincoln
 a lot of people forget that but we have to bring it up
 to protect the health and safety of our citizens we awarded 100 million to improve water infrastructure in flint
 how badly was flint
 who were the geniuses that did that to you
 you have clean water coming into flint
 they had to pay a very tiny little fee
 so instead they go into this horrible horrible really polluted water and the water comes out of there
 they spend hundreds of millions of dollars to save like a couple of bucks and the water was so terrible and it hurt the people
 it hurt the people
 but we're getting it fixed
 and i know your previous governor was a republican but i was not a big fan of his
 i was not but i'm not a big fan of the one that can't fix the potholes either
 we're committed to ensuring america has the cleanest air in the cleanest water on planet earth and that's what it's about
 it's about clean air and it's about clean beautiful water
 and it's about keeping our industry not closing it because of the ridiculous paris climate accord
 how's paris doing
 i don't think too well
 how's paris doing with the yellow vests
 the yellow vests
 you know why
 because they raise gasoline prices so they could send them money all over the world to countries that the people in france never heard of
 it's not working out too well
 we're lowering prices
 we're lowering taxes
 we're making it possible
 i mean look at gas prices now
 look at gas prices
 i recognize israel's true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem
 and we also recognize israeli sovereignty over the golan heights
 big deal
 for years you watched as your politicians apologized
 member i would like to apologize
 i would like to apologize
 nah we don't apologize
 now you have a president who is standing up for america and we are standing up for the great people of michigan
 you're getting your auto industry back
 at stake in our present battle is the survival of the american nation
 if you want your children to grow up a land of safety it's really we want a land of safety justice
 well i don't know
 when i look at those fbi reports we got out we got to clean up a lot
 what they've done to hurt people what they've done to hurt with comey and these horrible people what they've done to hurt people
 i think one of the best things i did as president a lot of people would say with all what we've done for the economy and but one of the best things is firing james comey's ass out of there
 boy those reports are kept
 did you see the other day
 well ah ah
 first time now he said in other words he's 50 there folks
 he's hit the golden pond
 anyway so what we're doing is we're doing things that are going to make our victory it's like a tree
 we need that extra four years
 we've done so much even right to try
 you know right to try
 people were traveling they're terminally ill they're traveling all over the world
 we have the best medical in the world the best doctors the best labs best hospital
 they're traveling all over the world to try and get because it takes years to get something approved
 and i said wait a minute folks why aren't we doing this
 and they've been trying to do it for 49 years
 they couldn't get it done
 not that easy
 the drug companies didn't want the liability the country didn't want the liability the insurance companies didn't want the liability
 i said here's what we do
 we'll sign an agreement with the people where you're exculpated from all liability
 huh
 that's a good idea
 and it's a very strong agreement so we can't get sued
 but i said listen they were worried they're going to hurt people
 i said these people are terminally ill
 they're terminally ill and so we do it now
 nine months ago all the legislators at the 49 years so if somebody's sick they don't have to go to asia they're have to go to europe
 or if you're poor you go home and you die
 now what happens
 very simple
 you sign that document they work it out
 you wouldn't believe how many lives are being saved
 it's incredible
 it's incredible
 i'm very proud of it right to try
 i hope you don't need it
 you don't want it
 you don't want it
 okay
 but if you do it's there
 with your help we will lift millions of more of our citizens from welfare to work dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity
 together we will elect a republican congress to create a fair safe sane and lawful system of immigration
 we will enact the greatest trade deals ever made
 they'll result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase made in the usa
 we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine
 what we're doing is unbelievable
 we're so far ahead of everybody
 what we've done in the last three years with the fda and even the speed of what we're doing it would take 12 13 14 years to get things approved
 it's down to a much smaller number but we're finding new cures for childhood cancer and we are ending the aids epidemic in america
 we've started the process
 who would've thought that
 in 10 years it's a 10 year process we will have ended the aids epidemic in america and it could have been been started before i came to office
 it was just wasted time
 we will defend privacy free speech free assembly religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms
 above all we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one america
 we support protect and defend the constitution of the united states
 we stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement
 they're incredible and that includes ice
 you know how tough these people are
 these are great patriots
 they love our country
 even the sheriffs alone for some of the people that they're dealing with
 these guys walk into the golem's nest and in some cases they just swing it out
 they can have it
 they love it
 these are great
 if we didn't have them and i told you before they're taking out bad bad bad people by the thousands especially ms13 gang members
 who's going to do that
 who's going to do that
 anybody in the front row
 i don't know
 what about you
 you're a tough guy
 you might do it
 you could do it
 i don't know
 you might yeah you can
 what you like
 we're going to recruit you
 i think you could handle yourself
 now these are tough people right
 you got to be tough
 then they get accused they're too tough
 oh they're too tough
 you have some of these guys
 they knife people
 they don't even need a gun because it's more painful
 they knife the two young girls 16 years old
 beautiful
 they cut them up into pieces because it was more painful than shooting them
 these are animals
 and then nancy pelosi said i shouldn't use the term animal
 and by the way she ought to go home and take care of her district where the homeless is all over the place and the tents and the filth and the garbage is a eroding right into the pacific ocean and into their beaches
 she ought to go and take care of her district in san
 do you see what's going on
 and it rains and it's filth and it's needles and it's drugs and it's you know what
 it's everything and it goes right into those storm sewers
 storm not sanitary storm and it goes right out into the pacific ocean into the beaches and we fine los angeles and san francisco but we've just sent them a tremendous dollar fine for what they're doing
 and nancy pelosi is playing games
 she ought to go home and take care of the homeless and take care of the filth and everything
 san francisco was the most beautiful city
 when you look at what's happened with the tents all over the place where the police officers are getting sick just from walking the beat they're getting sick
 diseases are coming back that this world hasn't seen for 30 40 50 years
 it's a disgrace
 she ought to get back and take care of her district instead of wasting time on this nonsense
 we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life
 we believe that faith and family not government bureaucracy are the true american way
 we believe that children should be taught to love our country honor our history and to always respect our great american flag
 and we live by the words of our national motto and it's always going to be up there
 they want to take everything down
 they don't want thomas jefferson anymore
 they don't want anything
 that's a terrible thing and we fight for it now
 we fight
 these words will never be taken off
 i don't care where i am
 if i'm up there if i'm down here i don't know but we'll be fighting
 we'll never take these words off in god we trust
 we stand on the shoulders of generations of michigan patriots who gave their blood sweat and tears for this beloved nation
 this is the state where henry ford invented the assembly line
 it's the place where general motors chrysler and kellogg transformed the nation
 it gave us motown the mustang and the might of the american midwest
 this is the american mid west
 and michigan is the state where generations of strong tough and proud american workers made this into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of the world
 and we are making it bigger better and stronger than ever before by far
 loyal citizens like you help build this country
 and together we are taking back our country
 we are returning power to you
 the american people the democrats took the people of michigan for granted but with us you will never be forgotten again
 the forgotten men and women of this country will never ever be forgotten again
 and i'm fighting for you
 and i love doing it with everything that i have
 and i will never ever stop
 and you know that
 i will say i could have a much easier life
 some people say why is he doing it
 you know why i'm doing it because we're doing the thing and look what we're doing is we're bringing back our country again
 we're respected again we're respected again
 we are so respected you don't even know how respected
 i went to nato where we were being ripped off because the other countries you have 29 countries and the other countries weren't paying their bills
 they were delinquent in real estate
 i noticed people are using that word
 i've been using it for the last year
 it's like a real estate trend
 that's when they don't pay their rent right
 well they weren't paying and you have to see this chart until i got there
 they got to pay and they said well does that mean you won't protect us
 i said you don't want the answer to that question
 over the last and the secretary general stoltenberg over the last period of just two years i raised not from us nothing from us 130 billion but that's nothing and over a short period of time they will be paying 530 billion more
 all of those countries
 my biggest fan in the world is secretary general stoltenberg of nato
 he says i never thought this could
 i'm telling you if you look it's like 15 years just down
 president obama would go there make a speech i'd like to thank everybody for being here
 thanks
 look great job
 sayonara
 goodbye
 bush they all did
 nobody ever asked for money
 we were spending for 100 of nato
 we're protecting europe
 they rip us off on trade right
 they rip us off like crazy
 we lose hundreds of billions of dollars on trade
 we're changing that but it's a long time
 it's been going on a long time
 they don't take your product
 they don't take your cars
 they don't take your farm product
 they don't take your medical machines
 we do a big business
 they sell us
 we don't sell them because they put restrictions
 we have better equipment than them but they make it so that our equipment doesn't qualify
 it's called artificial barriers or non-monetary barriers
 it's brutal what they do
 i'm telling you they're as bad as china just smaller
 they are as bad as china just smaller and now china's doing great
 we're very happy but we have to do something with that
 we have to take care of our people
 we can't be ripped off by these countries so nato is ripping us off militarily but now they're starting to pay big money and that's good
 we want to help them
 we want to be there with them but they have to pay
 they have to pay
 530 billion and the fake news doesn't even want to talk about it
 they don't want to talk about it
 they talk about other things
 they don't want to talk about that
 when you'd get a chance though just a couple of weeks maybe you could say over a short period of time nato countries will be paying 530 billion more
 more not total
 more
 how's that
 good
 that's not too bad
 nobody else could do that i guarantee
 i won't tell you what took place in those closed door meetings
 some of them don't like me
 they like obama
 germany likes obama
 a lot of these countries france they like obama
 it's embarrassing
 in france president obama is more popular than president trump
 well i should be
 i just taxed their wine and champagne coming into our country because they're ripping us off on the internet
 okay
 if i ever become more popular that means i'm not doing my job
 you should say he's out
 it's true
 i could be loved in germany
 i could be loved in germany
 oh they'd love me
 my father came from germany parents and i could be loved in germany
 they'd like me so much but then i'm not doing my job for you
 have to do it
 have to do it
 with your help your devotion your drive we're going to keep on working
 we're going to keep on fighting
 we are going to keep on winning winning winning because we are one movement one people one family and one glorious nation under god
 america is thriving like never before
 and ladies and gentlemen of michigan the best is yet to come
 great state
 great state
 you better remember all those jobs in a year from now i tell you
 i'll say that state let me down
 i don't think that's going to happen
 i'm hearing very good thing
 you know the interesting thing before it was like a promise
 i said i'm going to bring car back
 i'm going to bring this
 i'm going to be pres it was all like it's good
 you believed me i was successful all this but now we've done it
 we have done more than i promised no politics
 i promised we've done more than we promised
 no politician i think has ever done that
 together we will make america wealthy again
 we will make america strong again
 we will make america proud again
 we will make america safe again and we will make america great again
 thank you
 thank you michigan
 thank you
