doesn't have the power
 doesn't have the staying power
 you see what's happening in california
 blackouts rolling blackouts
 how would you like that in pennsylvania
 the commonwealth of pennsylvania
 darling what's wrong
 i can't watch trump on television
 i can't watch our president
 darling we have a rolling blackout
 it'll only be a few hours
 i think we'll be on by two o'clock in the morning darling and we can watch a rerun
 now this is what's happening
 you have rolling blackouts
 you have in some cases just blackouts
 i don't even call them rolling
 not going to happen to your state
 last year i visited the shell petrochemical plant in beaver county pennsylvania the largest investment in your state's history
 that was all made possible by our pro energy policies
 we've done it a lot
 in louisiana we're building some of the largest plants you've ever seen largest in the world and it's incredible all related to energy but your security and your jobs are in very grave peril because the radical left maniacs they don't want to have anything to do with energy
 they don't want anything to do with they have different concepts right
 they have the green new deal whether it will be no energy almost of any kind
 no it's crazy
 thought of by aoc plus three
 you know aoc
 and she's got them
 she's radical left but she's not as bad as some of them
 how about omar of minnesota
 we're going to win the state of minnesota because of her they say
 he's telling us how to run our country
 how did you do where you came from
 how is your country doing
 she's going to tell us she's telling us how to run our country
 you know what
 the democrats in congress you have to see what they are doing
 their stance on israel it's like a whole different world
 it's like from 10 years ago it's like a different world and we want to keep our world the way it was and the way it's going to be
 we've got the greatest country on earth and we're going to keep it that way
 we don't need socialist and we don't need communist telling us how to run our country
 i do this every night and a lot of times it's a waste
 i did it last night
 we were … did you see the crowd we had last night
 we were in a great place ohio
 we had a crowd
 we had a crowd
 you couldn't see the end of it
 i said turn around camera turn around
 but they never liked doing that you know
 they don't like spinning those cameras
 they don't want to show the crowd
 they don't like showing
 they don't like showing show the crowd and this is … it's an honor
 let me tell you
 look i used to think that was a difficulty like it was a new camera that can't turn but then whenever there was like a problem like there'd be a little argument or some kind of an anti-trump person you don't see that much
 i don't want to bring it on but you don't see it much anymore
 you know why
 it's dangerous
 it's dangerous for them but you know i'd see the camera would never move whenever where there's something like a little negative happening that thing would turn around like a pretzel
 i said oh it does move
 but they never want to show the crowds
 they never last night
 now i went home and i tell you this i go home all the time
 first lady how'd you like the crowd
 sir i didn't see it
 i didn't see it but i didn't see it donald
 i didn't see it
 sometimes she'll call me mr
 president but she's only kidding
 believe me
 she's only kidding
 has she been a great first lady right
 she's been a great first lady and very popular
 she's really done a great job
 she works hard
 we have some great people here tonight
 i brought certain members of my family but i'm going to introduce them to you in a little bit okay
 great family
 they work hard
 i'll tell you what they work hard
 they really work hard
 but i do wish they would show because it would be you know it's actually better for them if they show
 it shows the importance
 the only thing you can do is show
 i'll say how did it look
 i don't know how it looked but the sound was phenomenal
 okay
 it sounded like a penn state football game like the steelers football game
 you can't disguise it
 you ever see sleepy joe with the little circles
 oh you can
 he puts them very far away so far away
 then he comes up with the mask
 he's like a hundred yards from the nearest human being
 he's got a … he feels good about the mask
 i wonder in the debate it'll be him and i or the stage
 is he going to walk in with a mask
 no i think he'll come in with a mask
 i don't know
 i have no idea
 well the question is will he leave it on during the debate
 because it's a little hard and i'm all for mask when you need them i'm up but when you're making a speech and the nearest person's like where you are and you're in a stage all by yourself and then he had a habit of taking it off and it hangs down on his ear as he's speaking it makes him feel comfortable
 honestly whatever makes you feel good is okay with me but it'll be interesting
 i'm going to be we're going to have a big rating on that
 he's been doing it all his life
 he's been doing it for 47 years and i've just started doing this stuff
 i'm just starting
 but i'm just thinking but i did it more in 47 months than he did in 47 years
 that's true
 that's true
 you look at what we've done
 no it's true
 that's actually true
 he did a lot of negative stuff too
 you have to deduct that out
 when asked if there would be any place for fossil fuels including coal and fracking in a biden administration joe replied no we would make sure that it's all eliminated
 all of a sudden he gets the nomination
 he's been trying to get the nomination for decades
 he finally get and that was prime time for him which was never great
 he never got more than 1
 we called it
 remember i called him his first nickname was 1 joe
 frankly had elizabeth warren been loyal to her philosophy which is radical left socialism perhaps communism
 i don't know perhaps
 it's verging on communism right
 but had she been loyal she would've left
 she would have quit
 she had no chance
 she was out
 pocahontas
 she was gone
 remember i said  i have more indian blood in me than you have and i have none
 i'd love to have some but i don't happen to have any
 then she choked and she went out and got a test
 she announced she had 1024th right
 1000
 that means like i said it last night that means around 700 or 800 years ago somewhere there was a little bit of a relationship going and that's okay
 seven 800 years ago maybe
 what a phony she is
 it's terrible
 now we're going to pick a great woman any one of the five that i told you but any one of the women that we had they're all great people great scholars great brilliant people
 a lot of people
 00 on saturday at the white house
 you see we have tremendous republican support
 two people
 always got to be two
 always got to be the two
 those two
 we have great support from the republican party tremendous support
 it's never been this unified before ever ever and the fake impeachment
 we had 196 to nothing republican support
 we had 52 and a half to a half in the senate
 who is the half
 i can't imagine
 i can't
 buddy was very good today
 i have to tell you he was good
 now i'm happy
 thank you mitt
 thank you
 no he was very good very positive statement but days ago biden reiterated his pledge to require net zero carbon emissions
 that's basically saying you know what that is
 there'll be no more oil
 there'll be no more gas
 there'll be no more nothing
 there'll be no more industry
 there'll be no more country
 that's what it's like really
 that would instantly shut down all fracking and all mining immediately in pennsylvania sending your jobs overseas sending your money to somebody else not you
 i'll keep your jobs in pennsylvania where they belong and you're going to be doing fracking for a long time
 i can say the same because you are really big in energy
 i can say the same thing to you as i say in texas
 so they don't want oil
 they don't want fracking right
 they don't want the energy that we know that powers these massive plants because the other stuff is wonderful
 it's not going to do it
 it's not going to do it
 so they don't like oil
 they don't like the gas
 they don't like god religion churches are close
 how about these states
 they still have churches closed
 by the way your governor hasn't been so great
 you know that right
 are your churches still closed
 they're still closed
 they're doing it for a reason
 by the way november 4th they'll announce we've decided to open up
 okay
 they're trying to make our numbers as bad as possible
 so california's closed
 pennsylvania's closed
 north carolina's closed
 michigan is closed
 that's another beauty right there michigan's closed
 then they have these fake ballots millions and millions of ballots
 by the way when not if when you see shenanigans please report it to your authorities
 okay
 the real authorities they're watching and the authorities are watching but please report it
 but when you look at it really it's amazing
 they're trying to make our numbers look bad but even with numerous closed states and you notice also law and order right
 law and order the red states the republican states they're working great
 record low crime record low but democrat run states you look at chicago you look at new york new york has gone through a … we have to bring back
 we should draft rudy giuliani
 okay
 let's bring him back
 draft rudy
 we want rudy
 rudy rudy
 i'll tell you rudy is amazing but he did a great job
 new york was in big trouble
 he came in and he just was tough smart and it became the safest big city
 now we have a man where some categories of crime were up 300
 he fired 1000
 he fired a lot of police i guess a billion dollars a year worth of police worth of great police firemen and women
 it's a terrible thing
 i love that place so much and it's so sad to see what's happening to new york
 we're going to make a little bit of a play for new york
 in theory the democrats automatically win new york but i do phenomenally in most parts
 then one part it's automatic but i can't imagine that particular part is going to be very happy
 so we're going to make a play for new york
 with pennsylvania i don't have to make a play
 we've got pennsylvania
 just go out of here
 we don't have to make a play
 we don't have to
 it's a great you know for years though pennsylvania was a place that republicans just didn't win
 for many years everybody thought they were going to win every republican
 so yeah we're going to win pennsylvania
 they thought they were going to win it and they didn't
 i came along and we won it and we won it quite easily
 quite easy
 i think we're going to do even better now because remember number one in the history of your state last year and that's because of what we did we stopped the dumping
 we saved your stell
 so many different things but pennsylvania is the home of american energy
 think of it that way
 this has taken place over a very short period of time
 also the birthplace of a thing called the american constitution
 right
 american constitution
 to uphold our constitution as written as opposed to as conceived by some radical left judge i will soon be announcing that nominee
 you're going to love it
 you're going to be so happy
 if you don't love it don't vote for me
 okay
 you don't like it
 my opponent refuses to release a list of justices
 i was told that a big thing when i was running last time nobody really knew me
 they knew me very well
 we had great success at the apprentice and in business and it was great but they never knew what kind of a judge i would pick or to be a justice right
 a justice of the supreme court
 i said i mean what am i going to do
 how am i going to solve that problem
 but i was in politics never
 don't forget when i ran they said no he's inexperienced
 i ran against some very talented people
 some of whom are very good friends of mine
 some of whom i don't like too much
 when i don't like somebody it last for a long time but i said well how do we solve that problem
 i don't know
 they just weren't believing
 the appointment of a- just weren't believing
 the appointment of a united states supreme court justice was much more important to the voters than i thought
 and they're right because they will set policy for 50 years and they'll set policy whether it's life whether it's second amendment
 the second amendment if i weren't president you know the pressure your second amendment would be obliterated
 it would maybe be gone but at a minimum obliterated they haven't touched your second amendment
 not even touched it
 because i'm here to block
 i'm a blocking force
 i'm like a lineman for the pittsburgh steelers
 i'm a blocking force
 no they haven't touched it
 but your second amendment would be under siege
 so nobody knew
 i never knew
 you hear about supreme court you know about supreme court you know about other judges by the way at the end of the first term we'll be close to 300 federal judges including court of appeals which i think is a record
 i guess it's a record
 it's a lot
 that's a lot
 nobody's done that
 it's record
 think of that
 300
 that's a big percentage of the entire judiciary
 think of that
 300
 and many many court of appeals judges but two great supreme court judges or justices
 and now we're going to get a third
 can you imagine our enemies
 three in one term
 so many presidents they just don't have the chance and it's so important
 but i said to my people i said so if they don't believe me what i'll do is i'll make up a list of 25 judges or people and we'll tell them i will only pick from that list
 they said that sounds like an interesting idea
 this was my idea
 when you've never run for office before you have to have a little bit of imagination
 so i got out a list i named the people the people are good and i said and i promise that i will pick someone like the people on this list
 and it didn't work
 it went nowhere because they didn't trust it
 they said we want you to pick the people on the list not somebody like the people on the list
 so i went back the next week i said i will pick somebody that's on this list
 and they were all great great judges for the most part i think almost entirely but judges and really respected conservative believers in our country solid incredible people
 and as soon as i did that things went through the roof
 it was amazing how important it was
 by the way would you stand up with that beautiful jacket
 i love this guy
 how many times- how many events
 he's been to a couple
 that's really great
 thank you very much
 i've seen him before
 he's been here a couple of times like about 90
 thank you man
 that's really nice
 i'm going to get one of those jackets
 by the way the wall
 the wall yeah 330 miles
 330 miles
 330 miles
 and yes we have a great relationship with mexico
 first they said he'll never be able to build it
 the democrats were just brutal
 i made a terrible mistake i said it last night i should have said we will not under any circumstances build a wall at our southern border
 they would have given me all the money in the world
 but stupidly i said we will build a wall
 and the democrats said let's not give it to him
 but we got it we won
 we won court cases we won court cases
 i won so much money we could build four walls if we wanted
 so then they said all right all right
 they've lost
 so by the way we're up to 330 the exact wall
 their dream choice
 i said to the border patrol i love these people they're great ice the border patrol what they do is incredible
 they're incredible
 i said give me your dream wall as long as we're building we might as well build a wall that you want
 let's build it right
 sir we have to have vision
 we need steel and concrete
 i said how about one or the other
 they said no sir we need steel and concrete
 we need steel
 inside those poles we have rebar and we have concrete and they're 30 feet tall
 we need all sorts of things
 we need them to be wired
 i won't tell you why they're wired but they're wired for a reason
 they're all wired up and they're incredible
 but you know what
 we got the wall
 nobody could have done it
 so once we had the wall and it started going up and then we hit a hundred miles 200 miles now we're at 330 and we're building 10 miles a week and it'll be finished very soon
 and we have the most secure border in terms of drug trafficking trafficking coming along and we've done phenomenally well
 because that's a lot of the territory that we need
 we're going to go up to probably a little bit over 500 miles so we're at 330
 but once they saw that i had it they said yeah but mexico's not paying for it
 but they are paying for it mexico's paying for the wall
 they are paying for it
 they're paying at the border
 they're paying for the wall
 all those trucks that go back and forth
 they're paying for the wall
 so the democrats said yeah but mexico… they always have to find something right
 and do you remember what i used to say that if they fight us remember people would say what happens if they fight you on the wall
 what happens if they fight you right to hell on the wall
 i said the wall would get 10 feet taller
 took a little hit on that we took a little bit of a hit but that's okay
 the wall is a tall sucker you don't want to get up to the top
 they look down they say oh ye ye how do we get down off this
 it's tall and it's strong and it's great
 and we appreciate because mexico has been working with us very closely
 they have right now 27000 mexican soldiers on our southern border making sure that people don't come into our country
 i want to thank the president of mexico
 very helpful
 so i made this list of potential justices and i'll tell you it all changed
 now i'm asking sleepy joe biden to give me a list and he doesn't want to do it
 you know why
 because he can only put super radical left judges on people that would destroy our country people that would destroy your country
 and he knows that he's not electable… he shouldn't be electable anyway
 this is the worst candidate
 you know where he is today
 they have a thing called the lid
 i don't even know
 do you know what lid stands for
 lid
 he put out a lid today early in the morning
 lid means he's not going to be anywhere today
 i'm working my ass off i'm in ohio i'm in texas i'm in florida i'm in michigan i'm in wisconsin
 man
 thank you
 that's so nice
 well that is something that one of the fake news reporters back there they said they've never heard of that one
 there was a chant that's going over the last six or seven rallies saying ‘we love you
' that's never happened to a politician before
 am i a politician
 i don't want to be a politician
 i don't think of myself as a politician
 but it really is i appreciate it
 i've never heard it
 i liked ronald reagan but they never said we love you or maybe they did
 they're going to try and find out
 then they'll say president trump lied last night because 40 years ago i remember… but no nobody's ever heard that one before and i appreciate it because it is reciprocal
 thank you very much
 reciprocal
 reciprocal love
 it's reciprocal
 i had such a nice life before i did this
 i had such a nice life
 then i had the witch hunt that goes on forever
 it goes on
 and then we catch them spying on our campaign
 how about that
 let's see what happens though
 but we caught them spying all of that the whole big deal
 and then the guys that were doing the investigation they have their 31 different phones they were accidentally wiped clean
 31 different phones i think it was like 19 different people and they all did the same exact accident
 which if you knew anything about phones it's almost an impossibility to do it once
 let alone 31 different times
 so we caught them and that's called obstruction
 we have to remember that's called obstruction
 that was the mueller group
 that was a mueller group
 all those phones they were wiped so clean
 and hillary got a subpoena on the 30
 i said forget about these things because you'll find them
 they have them
 they're in the state department
 i have no doubt about it they're in the state department but they'll get them
 but you know what
 33000 they have a request from the us congress that's not bad us congress they send a subpoena very very important and after getting the subpoena she deleted all of her emails and acid washed and then she took her telephones
 i've gotten rid of phones too
 i throw them away
 she took cameras and she beat the hell out of them with a hammer and then threw them away
 and they found a couple of them
 she was very angry obviously if she did the hammer work
 but if anyone else said this there's a protection there's a dual level of justice but we're getting down to the bottom of it because it's not fair to us
 not fair to us
 33000 emails
 she deleted them on the basis that it was all about her daughter's wedding chelsea and also yoga classes
 33000 emails on yoga and a wedding
 i don't think so
 and comey said oh that's okay
 that sounds like a good reason
 that's comey
 that's another beauty right there that comey
 but we caught him we caught him
 very smart move
 getting rid of that guy was a smart move but we caught him
 listen we caught him
 they were spying on the campaign they were doing actually worse than that
 nobody's ever done a thing like this so let's see what happens
 but we caught him cold we got so much stuff
 remember the insurance policy right
 from strzok and page two lovers
 they were very smart
 they would use the public servers and send it over the public wires because they didn't want to be caught having an affair
 so they went over the public
 that was a very good thing for us
 wasn't it
  darling darling darling please
 she's going to win
 she's going to win isn't she
 peter peter only you can save us
 peter she's going to win
 yes darling
 she's going to win
 i know
 100000 to nothing
 remember that
 it was actually 100 million to one
 this was a hundred million to one
 this is this idiot
 so listen so darling please please tell me again
 yes 100 million to one she's going to win
 but just in case she doesn't we have an insurance policy
 now that only means one thing
 and we went through the insurance policy and we caught them
 so let's see what happens to these treasonous crooks
 these terrible people
 and they put our nation through turmoil
 but i just want to thank… a lot of people were very unfairly treated
 you look at general flynn look he's still going through it
 can you believe it
 but a lot of people were unfairly treated by a bunch of treasonous horrible people
 and they used the intelligence agencies of our country to try and steal an election and to try and do a coup
 wouldn't you think
 who would ever think this country… but that's all you can say
 some people would say well that's a conspiracy theory
 no just take a look at the records
 for me it's a very exciting thing because we found something that nobody would have thought possible
 now let's see what happens
 but we have them cold they spied on our campaign
 it's our campaign and if you want to save america you have to go out get out and vote
 this is the most important election
 in just three and a half years we've secured america's borders which makes them very unhappy rebuilt the awesome power of the us military we built the military
 it was totally depleted when i took over
 we built a military
 two and a half trillion dollars we spent all made in the usa the greatest equipment the greatest planes and rockets and missiles and our nuclear
 i hate to even mention the word and hope to god we never have to use it but we have the most powerful weapons in the history of the world
 and we did that over a very short period of time
 weapons that are so powerful that we're the envy of the world but i never want to use those weapons
 and hopefully we'll never have to
 you know the way you don't have to use them is when you have them
 it's when you have them
 but nobody's ever built force like what we have
 and the newspapers and the press and the fake news they went and said he just gave away classified information
 i said no i will look you right in the eye first of all i'm allowed to do it i'm the president so i'm allowed to actually
 i'm the only one that's allowed to
 but no no i didn't give away
 i'm just telling you most powerful weapons ever produced we have and other countries know that
 and it's a good thing that they know it and i don't think we'll ever be using them
 and i hope we don't
 i hope to god
 i use the word god because they refuse to use the word god in their pledge of allegiance right
 twice
 i use the word god
 i hope to god we never have to use them
 but i obliterated the isis caliphate which was all over the place
 100
 remember i got it down to 99
 they said you got to go a hundred
 i said let's get out of here
 we're bringing them all back home
 everyone's coming back home
 long long wars
 the never ending wars the endless wars
 we fixed our disastrous trade deals they were a disaster brought jobs and factories back to pennsylvania under 16 years
 and think of this for 16 years presidents obama president bush household income rose 2945
 that's over a 16 year period
 in three years your household income rose almost 10000
 when you include energy
 you have to include energy
 without energy almost 7000
 but we have to include energy
 i mean how much are you paying for your gasoline
 you never saw 2 gasoline
 less right
 it's less
 they go up it's less
 it's a big difference
 what is it nowadays
 come on tell me
 i haven't got any gas
 i haven't stopped recently at a gas station
 15
 okay
 because for a while it was way under two
 and we're going to keep it there
 we have so much we have so much
 in my first three years we lifted 6
6 million people out of poverty the largest poverty reduction in the history of our country by far
 we built the greatest economy in the history of the world
 and right now we're doing it again
 i see all these hats make america great again
 and now i'm going to say this make america great again again
 make america great again again again
 we saved 1
4 million jobs in pennsylvania alone and to fight the china virus it's the china virus not the coronavirus
 corona sounds like a place in italy a beautiful place
 it's corona
 no it's the china virus
 they don't want to say it
 the radical left they don't want to say it
 you ever notice they're always going to have to russia
 look nobody's been tougher on russia than me
 russia russia russia
 i said what about china
 they never going to to mention it
 they got little deals going on i think
 but coronavirus doesn't it sound like italy
 a beautiful villa
 corona
 no it's a china virus
 they should have stopped it
 to fight the china virus we launched the largest national mobilization since world war ii
 we did an a+ job except we did a d job in terms of public relations explaining it because we were too busy doing it
 but the fact is they wouldn't have written it anyway
 it didn't matter to them
 it's there
 it's their little thing
 you have a watch biden
 he can't talk about it he thinks so he gets up the coronavirus they say we want to talk about supreme court judge today
 well i don't know about that
 the coronavirus
 and he doesn't know we did a great job he has no clue
 he said i should have opened
 he goes i should have shut down one week earlier
 what he doesn't say is he did the worst job in the history of an epidemic or a pandemic with the swine flu
 it was a joke
 and what he did his own man that was in charge said recently we had no idea what the hell we were doing
 it was a total disaster
 there were amateurs
 and now he tells us how to do something that's far more lethal
 but he said  they should have closed one week early except when it came to closing the border which i did which turned out to save tens of thousands of lives biden criticized me until two months later when he said i was right
 but we should have closed a weak earlier
 think of that
 we pioneered lifesaving therapies reducing the fatality rate 85 since april
 think of that
 remdesivir the plasmas we have among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country
 nobody knows that
 and i am devastated to see it happening but you see what's going on in europe again
 they were always saying oh europe is doing better
 actually we did better but now europe has a big spike a big spike
 so they're not talking about that
 the number of hospitalized virus patients is down by 47 and virus patients coming to the emergency room is down and visits are way down visits to hospital
 europe has almost a 50 greater excess mortality rate than the united states
 they're liking to compare us to europe
 50 greater excess mortality rate
 our early and aggressive action saved millions of lives through operation warp speed
 you've heard about it they don't want to talk about it
 what we've done in a record period of time with the ventilators now we're building ventilators for the world
 very hard to do
 we'll develop and distribute a vaccine very very shortly in record time it would have been two or three years four years if biden's group had done it but we've done a great job with the fda in clearing a path and you'll be seeing it very shortly
 and these are great companies that are doing it
 so we'll crush the virus and our opponents will with him they will crush america
 we can't let it happen
 this country is too great
 our love of each other is too great
 this guy doesn't know he's alive
 he really doesn't
 he doesn't know he's alive
 he did an ad on an anonymous source that said about me making a statement about military soldiers that died
 and it was such a disgusting thing
 i said the only good thing about it is now i can take the gloves off
 this guy doesn't have a clue
 he doesn't know where the hell he is and they'll give him a shot of something
 i don't know he's going to get something
 because i watched him so badly he performed so badly in the debates and then with bernie he was average not great but he got through and i said what the hell is he taking
 and we'd like to ask him
 and i said that we want a drug test we want a drug test
 we'll both take it
 we'll both take it
 because with bernie he was able to get through
 but listen it wasn't winston churchill
 this wasn't the greatest but he got through it was fine
 him and bernie screaming at each other mostly bernie
 crazy bernie
 he's not too happy
 i'll tell you did you ever see a better loser than bernie though
 seriously
 he's a good loser
 he got terribly treated by hillary and that group
 and then it happened again with elizabeth warren right
 it happened again
 what the democrat party did to him
 and then you have this guy mike bloomberg mini mike one question and he was gone
 there goes 1
8 billion out their window
 i said you think it's easy up here mike don't ya
 one question and that was the end
 he said where am i
 get me the hell off of this platform
 mini mike mini mike
 so now he's trying to buy into the party
 you would think after the way they treated him they called him every name pocahontas destroyed him she didn't do good against me but boy did she do good against mini mike
 i figured he'd be calling and saying listen i want to become a republican
 we've done great for the economy you'd think
 but he always wanted to run for president and he tried before i guess but he tried and it was a bad experience
 and you would think he would have joined our party
 but instead he's trying to buy his way back in
 when somebody treats you that way even stay neutral don't go back in
 he wants to give them a lot of money to try and buy their friendship
 and one thing you learned about politics i spent a fraction of the money that crooked hillary spent
 they raised 2 billion
 i spent my own money but i spent a fraction of the money… i spent my own money but i spent a fraction of the money like 35 30 and we won
 nobody ever says that
 it's not about money
 it's about other things
 there are other things involved
 it's not just about money
 in the old days my father would teach me if you can win and spend less that's a good thing
 i remember after i won and i won decisively look 306 to 223
 that's a lot
 306 delegates 306 that's decisive
 we won michigan and we're going to win it again
 we're up in a poll just now
 oh they're going crazy
 they're going crazy
 we won wisconsin
 we won pennsylvania
 but my father taught me
 he said if you can win and spend less money that's a good thing not a bad thing
 that's a good thing not a bad thing
 like if you get along with the leaders of other lands and don't go to war all the time with everybody and can come out on top without having to shed blood all over the place and destroy your families and your country like when i get along with putin when i get along with kim jong-un
 whatever happened to the war we were supposed to be in with north korea
 nothing happened
 they said i gave away so much
 i said what did i give away
 they couldn't find that anything
 i didn't do anything
 they said you met
 oh i met
 oh okay
 i met
 now you would have been in war with her
 you would have been in war
 but if you can spend think of this if you can spend less money and win that's a good thing
 so after i won one of these people back there right back there- … in order to keep the thing going on trump i had won he said but trump raised substantially less money than crooked hillary clinton
 that's because i didn't need the money
 i didn't need the money
 i can call up a lot of rich guys that raised a lot of money but i feel uncomfortable doing it because when you do that it's like you're sort of … it's not the same
 i could call up every guy
 they call me up and they say sir how are you sir
 mr
 president sir
 i have friends see
 i don't have too many friends up because i used to be comfortable
 you have to be comfortable with people right
 i have friends i have one friend richard
 i talk about him all the time but multiply this times a hundred people
 richard used to call me up five six years ago
 hey let's have dinner
 all right
 where do you want to go
 i don't know
 go to some crazy restaurant
 today the restaurants are all closed in new york
 they don't want to open them
 they want to make them do badly until november but don't worry they're opening in november 4th
 but it's true
 so it's richard on the phone richard my friend for many many years
 i said hey richard how are you doing
 mr
 president sir how are you
 i said well …  he's been calling donnie and don and dj and all
 richard are you okay
 everything good
 yes sir
 mr
 president sir
 you're doing a great job and i'd like to thank you
 good richard
 richard loosen up please
 you don't have to call me mr
 parson
 i said just call me donald
 it's okay
 thank you donald
 i really appreciate it
 and you hear the guy can't breathe
 he's having a hard time breathing
 he's very nervous
 then at the end of the phone he goes mr
 president again thank you so much for the job you do and he hangs up
 i said how can you be friends with … 
 it just doesn't work
 it's like i've lost a lot of people this way
 it's called respect for the office
 they have respect for the office
 they really do
 nothing wrong with it
 i sort of understand that
 they have respect for the office
 nobody has more respect for this offices than i do
 that's why i'm doing a great job and i'll always do a great job
 it's respect for the office
 but on november 3rd pennsylvania will decide whether we end the pandemic defeat the virus and return to record prosperity just like we were before or whether we allow sleepy joe biden who doesn't have a clue to kill the recovery raise your taxes delay the vaccine
 so he wants to impose a 4 trillion tax
 do you believe
 4 trillion
 ban american energy which means what
 hey let's go back
 let's call up the middle east and let's be real nice to them because we need their energy
 no thank you
 destroy your suburbs
 you know i got rid of this regulation that was going to destroy your suburbs
 destroy your suburbs
 i call it the obama regulates
 they're building nice projects right next to your beautiful home
 lots of luck
 give free healthcare
 i hope the people in the suburbs … when i did this i took a lot of heat
 i got rid of a regulation
 they all said sir we'll amend the regulation
 we're going to amend it
 i said i don't want to amend it
 a couple of stories where written
 i wish the women living in the suburbs would read these stories
 they were written by people that say i can't believe a president had the guts to do it
 i did because i want to save the american dream
 by the way a big part of the american dream are minorities who made it and they want to live in the suburbs and they don't want to be next to a project
 remember
 sleepy joe
 he'll do it because he has no choice because they have total power
 he's like a puppet for them and indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-american lies
 to combat the toxic left wing propaganda in our schools i announced last week that we are launching a new pro-american lesson plan for students called 1776 commission
 we will teach our children the truth about america that we are the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth and getting better every single day
 we're not going to let it fail
 the democrat party has joined forces with flag burners anarchists anti-police people they're extremist
 agitators
 and then they say oh no no this was a peaceful protest
 this is a peaceful protest
 they know what i'm talking about
 they know our great uniform
 brilliant
 we love them but you know what
 we call it a peaceful protest now because the only thing you're allowed to do in pennsylvania can't go to church right
 you can't meet you can't congregate
 you can't look at each other
 you can't give your wife a kiss goodnight
 you've got to wear a mask
 you can't do anything
 they got you closed up
 don't go out to dinner stay where you are
 michigan same thing like the governor
 her husband went boating
 it was a disaster because nobody's allowed
 he was the only boat
 he had this massive beautiful lake
 you know the lake i'm talking about
 it's a big lake
 they've got to be able to do their job
 you've got to let them do their job
 got to be able to do your job right
 they let you do your job you'd see
 you'd see pennsylvania not some big bad crime numbers in your state
 you let them do your job
 any state new york's finest
 by the way i got endorsed by new york's finest
 first time they've ever endorsed
 and you know that's hard when you have radical left running the city all politicians the mayor
 i got endorsed by the chicago police
 can you imagine that
 i got endorsed by oklahoma and i got endorsed by texas and louisiana
 i got endorsed by florida the sheriffs
 all the sheriffs got together they endorsed trump
 i got endorsed by law enforcement everybody
 but how could you possibly endorse people that hate you and don't respect the job you do and don't let you do your job most importantly
 because if they let you do what you do better than anybody else in the world you wouldn't have problems
 these are other police departments
 you look at seattle
 we said we're going in and they immediately said we'll put up our hands
 it was so easy
 we were going in the following day
 you look at portland
 how about portland
 it's like an anarchist's dream
 we're dealing with the governor because you know i hate to say it but they're all democrat-run cities and states
 all of them every single one
 the republicans are doing great but they have to ask
 by law they have to ask us to go in
 but do you remember that beautiful day
 it was 10 days late
 you had these people from cnn and other places
 these are friendly protests
 that's a lovely thing to say
 as he's getting rocks and cans of tuna fish
 they go out to buy tuna fish and soup
 you know that right
 goya
 i hope goya he's great isn't he
 good guy
 they go out and buy goya because they throw it
 they throw it
 it's the perfect weight tuna fish they can really rip it and that hits you
 no it's true
 bumblebee brand tuna and you can throw it at soccer you can a curve on it
 you can do whatever else you want
 the cops in chicago you saw they're going like this
 it was terrible
 they're not allowed to fight back
 they're not allowed to fight back
 these guys if they fight back nobody's going to be there very long throwing things
 but they're professionals they're anarchists
 they're paid for by outside stupid rich people that … they're stupid people
 by the way you know the first ones that get wiped out
 they don't have a shot by the way i'll tell you that but if they ever did the first ones that would get wiped out are the stupid people that gave them the money to do this stuff
 those are the people that would get wiped out
 but you know they're very smart
 everything is perfect
 do you ever see where they drop the bricks along the thing in a bag
 then they drop everyone picks them up throws them at our great police
 we're not going to let that stuff happen but this is all a democrat
 it doesn't happen with republicans
 i was with greg abbott
 i was with ron desantis texas and florida and other governors that can't even believe a thing like that could happen but they get caught
 they're walking up
 there're like 30 cans of soup
 they have like 25 cans of tuna
 they get caught
 i'm bringing this home to my family
 how dare you stop me
 no no no
 they use it as ammunition
 it's terrible shame
 but he went down and he didn't like it
 he was hit
 police brutality
 you remember that
 they walked in and they've got the tear gas
 they've got everything you can possibly have
 pepper spray
 they don't want you to use tear gas anymore
 in some places like i think in milwaukee they said no tear gas no pepper spray
 how the hell do you keep big crowds back
 you can't
 so the police all quit
 they all quit
 they said we can't do it
 but you remember they went out and you had one then you had two three four then you had five six seven
 all of a sudden they started pouring in
 they were getting off the buses
 they came from a different locale and then you had a line of them and there was no social distancing unfortunately
 in fact i was going to turn them in because they were right next to each other
 they were right next to each other
 they were touching arms and they had big strong arms like these guys right over here
 there were big strong guys
 that's all right
 they were like together
 then you saw the first line
 then you saw the second line then you saw a third line and then you saw a fourth line
 then they said march
 they never halted
 just walked right through cleaned everything up and minneapolis was cured
 they were cured
 they grabbed them
 they grabbed them
 they grabbed them
 they were grabbing them left and right
 sometimes they grabbed they grabbed one guy i'm a reporter
 i'm a reporter
 get out of here
 they throw him aside like he was a little bag of popcorn
 but no but i mean honestly when you watch the crap that we've all had to take so long when you see that it's actually … you don't want to do that but when you see it it's actually a beautiful sight
 it's a beautiful sight
 behind him was like 10 blocks of fire was … i'd never
 it's a classic
 i don't know
 anybody you know what i'm talking about
 is it … so i just have such respect but you have to let these great professionals do what they do best
 you have to let them do what they … it's called law and order
 we need law and order
 so democrat phenomena
 if they win sleepy joe if they win because he has no power over these people these people are crazed lunatics
 if they win your cities will be like this
 you'll lose all rights
 your constitution will be worthless
 it'll be a terrible terrible thing
 i'm not even sure that after some time listening to that and going along with it i'm not even sure the country can ever recover
 that's how bad it would be
 i'm not sure it could ever recover
 over labor day
 left-wing radicals rampaged through pittsburgh harassing diners at restaurants
 i saw that one
 that was horrible
 no i saw that right
 i saw that
 that one guy grabs a woman a older woman she's eating a steak
 he grabbed the steak and started eating it then he threw it back on the plate
 an outdoor place and her husband standing there like they're afraid for their lives
 it was a terrible thing and should never be allowed to happen
 a thing like that should just be closed up before it ever gets started
 that was terrible
 remember that
 an older woman
 last week after a police officer shot a knife-wielding assailant over 100 rioters rampaged in lancaster
 went to school right nearby
 looting businesses setting fires and assaulting police offices with rocks and bricks and glass
 you saw that
 joe biden has the support of violent left wing extremists
 he never once mentioned the words law and order during their entire democrat national convention
 never once
 they didn't talk about the riots they didn't talk about anything having to do with law and order and respect and our great police
 they didn't do it
 they didn't talk about it
 it's not a subject
 they will rip your cities apart and they will go to your suburbs for all of those people in the suburbs that are ready to go about they will go to your suburbs next
 i have the support of america's law enforcement heroes
 i was recently honored to be endorsed by the largest group of police and police representatives in the country
 we're endorsed by everybody
 we're joined by butler county mike slupe
 thank you mike as well as two sheriffs who just changed their registrations oh that's nice to become republicans

 oh did you hear today

 they said if i submit the name of one of the most talented people in the world to be a justice of the supreme court they want to impeach me
 they want to impeach me if i'm following the constitution
 no think of it
 this is crazy nancy
 these people are stonecold crazy
 think of it
 i got impeached for making a perfect phone call
 perfect phone call
 everybody read it

 you know crying chuck
 he cries every time he thinks it's appropriate
 now i'll tell you what
 this conor lamb turned out to be a stonecold phony
 when he was running … it's a very trump … they like me
 i thought he was a republican because his ads were so good
 we have to respect our president
 we have …  i said this guy's doing some beautiful ads and then i found out he was a democrat
 i'll tell you what
 he's nothing compared to sean
 sean is the real deal
 thank you so much

 our campaign chair bernie comfort
 thank you bernie
 bernie comfort
 thank you
 thank you to bernie comfort
 thanks bern
 all right
 while you guys are standing behind me like a beautiful curtain there … well they're not blocking air force one so we could … but i have a woman with us tonight who has devoted so much
 she gave up her business
 she said dad i'm going to come to washington and help you
 i love you daddy and we're going to help people
 i don't care and …  she was very successful in every way and it's my daughter ivanka
 i just want to thank this group of people
 and a man that helped we just negotiated a major peace deal in the middle east
 everyone said it was impossible
 you know that right
 they said it's impossible
 they've been killing everybody for years and years they had this guy john kerry who's grossly incompetent
 they paid 150 billion to iran they paid 1
8 billion in cash
 that's even more impressive frankly in cash that's john kerry
 and we just made a deal with bahrain and uae united arab emirates and israel and it's a great thing
 and the man right there jared the abuse the abuse he takes but he did something that nobody's been able to do and he wants none of the glory he'd rather not come up here
 these guys will come up 100
 jared great deal great job
 incredible
 everyone's talking about it
 we have plenty of other countries going to join and there's no blood in the sand
 okay
 thanks honey
 thank you
 great people
 thank you sean
 thank you sean
 we have spent the last four years reversing the damage that joe biden inflicted over the last 40
 they like sean
 sean will you please win
 sean parnell
 i'll tell you he's popular
 that's great sean
 we love sean
 but biden championed every globalist portrayal of pennsylvania for half a century he was a cheerleader for the worst trade deal ever made by any country nafta and china's entry into the world trade organization which built china like a rocket ship
 they were flat lined for many many decades and then right through the roof that was a biden approval
 these disasters ripped out one third of your state's manufacturing jobs
 you know what happened
 biden shouldn't be asking for your vote he should be begging for your forgiveness
 he did a terrible job
 now the democrat party is pledging to rejoin the disastrous paris climate accord
 you want to spend a lot of money for nothing
 eviscerating your state's economy you will spend a trillion dollars and what it is really it takes away your power it takes away your energy
 you'll be closing your plants and factories all over the place
 i withdrew from it
 and you know what the people that understand the smart people they said i can't believe you had the guts to do it
 and i figured i was going to be absolutely killed on this one
 and you know what i'm so proud i did it and people get it
 it was a rip off of the united states
 i withdrew from the catastrophe because i was elected to fight for pittsburgh not for paris
 this election is a choice between pennsylvania and china if biden wins china wins
 when we win pennsylvania wins and america wins
 for decades our politicians spent trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations fighting foreign wars that never ended and defending foreign borders
 but now we're finally protecting our nation rebuilding our cities and we are bringing our jobs our factories and our troops back home in the usa where they belong
 all coming home
 during the pandemic i've suspended the entry of foreign workers who threatened american jobs
 as our economy reopens i want to ensure that americans are first in line to get the great jobs and the high wages
 america first
 biden wants to flood the economy with cheap labor to replace us workers
 you know that
 and that's why never never i see his say hire american
 he got it for me all the words he's got there are my words right
 do you ever see it
 they say he copied my campaign
 i keep saying what the hell happened for 47 years and now he's copying my campaign
 as president … and you know it's not going to happen with him as president i know my first duty is always to take care of you the american worker
 that's what we're taking care of
 under my administration we've achieved the most secure border in us history and we are finishing that wall it's going to be done so fast
 it's got to be done so fast
 since 2017 ice has successfully arrested nearly a half a million illegal aliens with criminal records including over 145000 assaults 40000 sex offenses and 5000 murderers
 if you don't mind democrats will bring them the hell out of our country we'll get them out of here
 some of them are so violent we have to keep them
 we don't want to house them for 50 years but if we let them go they come back in as much as we watch
 if they come back in we don't want it we don't want them
 so we keep them here we have no choice
 if the left gains power they will abolish … republicans will always … they're going to abolish
 republicans will always stand with these incredible heroes of ice and border patrol
 you have to see these ice people
 they go into a den of ms13 and they call them a den a nest where you have these guys that are vicious vicious gang members
 and they go in there they just start swinging
 it's the craziest thing they love it
 now who wants that job
 do you want that job
 look he's a tough guy sitting here you too you're tough guys you don't want any part of it
 they're just incredible and they love our country
 they love our country
 and then people say  oh they're too rough
 they're too rough
 you have no idea how bad some of these gangs are and what they do
 they use knives because it's more painful
 they cut people up
 they cut two young beautiful girls 16 years old
 they were going home from school and they cut them to pieces killed them they're animals
 we invested 2
5 trillion in the us military and launched the first new branch of the us armed forces in 75 years space force
 not since the air force
 think of it the air force was last
 if i did just that space force big deal by the way it's going to end up being one of the most important things you've ever imagined
 but if i just did that a sixth branch of the us military that would be a big deal
 that's like one of many many things
 we passed va choice and va accountability
 we killed the founder and leader of isis al-baghdadi they were after him for a year
 we took out the world's number one terrorist and the mass murderer of american troops and many others
 qasem soleimani is gone
 i withdrew from the last administration's disastrous iran nuclear deal one of the great disasters
 and by the way it's practically expired
 the crazy deal that obama made practically expired
 and his chief negotiator he never left
  i want this
 nope
 we're not giving to you
 okay let's go on to the next one
 give me this
 nope
 give me this
 nope
 give me this
 nope
 he never won a point he lost everything
 it's the worst deal i've ever seen
 and the only time he left the table is to go on a bicycle ride and he crashed and broke his leg and his arm
 and i promised everybody i would never go riding in a bicycle race
 i swear to you
 i kept my promise recognized the true capital of israel and opened the american embassy in jerusalem
 i also recognized israeli sovereignty over the golan heights
 that was a 52 year development that i got done in about a day
 they'd been negotiating that sovereignty over the golan heights i got it done immediately
 52 years they worked on that
 but instead of endless war we are forging peace in the middle east
 it's so great
 peace in the middle east
 so biden's put forward a platform that would end america as we know it
 and this is true
 i don't think of him as a radical lefty but basically he's controlled by them
 and what about this kamala
 how about her
 she at 15 no she's at 13
 then people started … no she's at 12
 no she's at 10
 she's at nine she's at seven
 these are a poll numbers
 she got worse than worse
 she quit before she ever got to iowa
 we have a great vice president mike pence
 he's great and he says hello
 if elected biden would destroy social security and destroy protections for preexisting conditions people with preexisting conditions drain your medicare by giving away your healthcare to illegal immigrants
 they're all going to come in
 if you have that the problem is we're going to give you healthcare they're going to all pour into the united states and our country can't afford it
 we want to be nice we all have hearts country can't afford it
 they would get people that never even thought of coming if they see that
 can't do it
 they would end our travel bans on jihadist regions
 we have very strong … remember i got travel bans
 everyone thought it was such a terrible thing such a terrible person
 he's such a terrible person
 i'm such a bad guy i got travel bans
 and increase refugee admissions by more than 700 opening the flood gates to radical islamic terrorism
 ban school choice and all charter schools they're very important
 in the second term i will provide school choice to every parent in america
 a vote for republicans is a vote for safe communities great jobs and a limitless future for all americans
 all americans race color creed all americans
 so in conclusion over the next four years we will make america into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we will end our reliance on china once and for all
 we will make our medical supplies right here in the united states right here in pennsylvania
 we will hire more police increase penalties for assaults or law enforcement and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities
 we'd ban them
 we will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life
 thank you
 we will uphold religious liberty free speech and the right to keep and bear arms
 we will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep america out of endless ridiculous stupid foreign wars
 we losing our youth to countries that you'd never even heard of right
 never even heard of them
 we will maintain america's unrivaled military might and we will ensure peace through strength
 we will surprise think of the surprise medical billing we're going to end it surprise
 you ever walk into a hospital oh gee fix you up
 oh great
 then you get a bill for 2000 for a band-aid
 we will end surprise medical billing require price transparency which i've already signed and brilliantly starts on january 1st
 hey you better vote for me
 you know i think that's in a way bigger than healthcare
 can you imagine biden if he won
 price transparency is so big it's all done it starts on january 1st
 how smart is that
 how smart
 and you're going to see numbers and reductions like you've never seen
 could you imagine if he were president sir our medical costs have dropped in half price
 transparency has been unbelievable
 what is that
 what is price transparency
 and they'll explain it to him
 he still won't have a clue
 but can you imagine giving him credit
 i signed it it's all done
 it starts on january 1st
 i say why can't you start it now just in case
 and know what they said sir statutorily it has to start then
 i said all right let's go
 but i know we're going to win so it's not going to matter
 and we're going to further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs
 we have a favored nations laws well now we get the same price as all these nations that are paying a tiny fraction which should have been instituted a long time ago
 and the drug companies are going after me with those ads
 oh it's terrible terrible
 you know why
 just every time you see an add from the drug company they got plenty of money that's why nobody ever fights them
 anytime you see an ad from a drug company just remember one thing your drug prices are coming down
 that's what it means
 that's what it means
 we will strongly protect medicare and social security and we will always protect patients
 we will protect every single patient
 america will land by the way the first woman on the moon and the united states will be the first nation to land an astronaut on mars
 you know nasa was an absolute disaster grass was growing through the fairways too
 they had fairways that's about all they use were the fairways
 and now we have something right through the runways the landing strips it was all grass infested it was all weed infested and now it's the number one space center in the world by far
 it was a closed up mess
 and we have rich guys sending up rockets elon and others
 they send up rockets and we say let them keep going
 let them keep spending money on these rockets
 they love rockets
 we will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools
 we will teach our children to love our country honor our history and always respect our great american flag
 and we will live by the timeless words in our national motto in god we trust
 for years you had a president who apologized for america
 now you have a president who is standing up for america and standing up for the people of pennsylvania like nobody has ever stood up before
 so get your friends get your family get your neighbors and your coworkers and get out and vote and early voting if you didn't know it has already begun and watch it and watch those fake ballots you got to go out and turn them in
 if you see somebody cheating you got to turn them in from erie … and you probably will it's going to be a mess watch this
 but get out and vote early
 from erie to eastern from altoona to scranton from harrisburg to right here in pittsburgh
 say hello to big ben
 we stand on the shoulders of pennsylvania patriots who gave their blood sweat and tears for their beloved country
 this is the state where our founding fathers declared american independence right
 this is the state
 such history such history
 it's where the army weathered it's brutal winter at valley forge i know it well
 where george washington led his men on a daring mission across the delaware and where our union was saved by the heroes of gettysburg
 gettysburg one of the great great incredible sights of history gettysburg
 so vicious so horrible and yet so beautiful and so historic right
