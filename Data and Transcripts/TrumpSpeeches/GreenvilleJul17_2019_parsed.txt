thank you very much
 thank you
 thank you
 thank you to greenville north carolina i want to thank you
 and to mike pence you've done a great job
 great vice president
 thank you mike
 and we have all night we're going to have a lot of fun tonight and i have nothing to do nothing nothing
 we have nothing to do but make our country great again and that's happening fast
 it's wonderful to be back in this beautiful state with thousands of hardworking north carolina patriots and thank you for your support
 thank you for that very big victory we had three years ago
 time is flying
 you getting ready
 let's do it again
 right
 let's do it again
 i just heard that the united states house of representative has overwhelmingly voted to kill the most ridiculous project i've ever been involved in the resolution
 how stupid is that
 own impeachment
 i want to thank those democrats because many of them voted for us
 the vote was a totally lopsided 332 to 95 to 1
 332 to 95 think of it we have the strongest economy in history the lowest unemployment numbers ever we've rebuilt the most powerful military it was totally depleted when i took office and now it's rebuilt
 we passed the largest tax cuts and regulation cuts of any president or any administration in history
 we took care of our great vets including veterans choice and veterans accountability
 and they want to try and impeach it's a disgrace
 it's a disgrace
 so now we have that behind us and i have to say this and i'll say it just once what happened to me with this witch hunt should never be allowed to happen to another president of the united states
 never ever again
 i want to thank republican leadership for what they've done for all of us by stopping that hoax the russian hoax i call it because america is winning again
 america's respected again and because we are finally putting america first
 our economic policy can be summed up in three very beautiful and simple words jobs jobs jobs
 we've created 6 million new jobs since election day
 if i would have said that nobody would have believed it
 if i would've said that the fake news would have said he's exaggerating
 and i wouldn't have said it because i wasn't even sure we could do it
 think of it 6 million jobs since election day think of it
 and by the way north carolina has had its best economic year in the history of your state
 our country has added more than 180000 people to the workforce and think of that through what we've done on a federal basis
 you picked up over 180000 jobs north carolina
 think of that and you have your lowest unemployment rate
 you have a lot of good things but let's not talk too much about north carolina
 let's win this election nationwide
 you remember north carolina that was going to be the clinton firewall
 she spent a fortune here and i kept coming in and coming out
 they call it earned media
 i earned it
 i kept coming in and coming out and every time i left they said i don't think we'll lose in north carolina
 you know what
 i was right
 we won it
 we won it easily
 we won it easily
 so i just want to thank everybody
 seriously
 this is a big… that was a big deal
 november 8th that was a big deal
 donald trump has won the great state of north carolina
 a big deal
 that was when you started to see the folks at a certain other convention beautiful looking place
 one of the most beautiful venues i've ever seen but i don't want any part of it
 it was unlucky
 i don't want any part but that's when you saw the people say what the hell is going on
 what
 what's happening
 and then it was state after state it was florida it was south carolina we love south carolina
 right
 unbelievable
 it was pennsylvania
 remember they wouldn't announce the numbers in pennsylvania so there was 1 of the vote remaining
 if i lost every one of those votes we still win by a lot and they wouldn't announce it
 they wouldn't announce it
 and then we won the great state of wisconsin
 first time in many many decades that a republican won
 and then we had a surprise but not a surprise to us because we're bringing back the auto industry
 we brought so much back to the great state of michigan
 that was a shocker remember that
 do you remember a certain hand on that beautiful board and they said you know this sport is getting awfully red
 that's republican
 there's a lot of red up there
 we had a lot of… that was one hell of a night wasn't it though
 one hell of a night
 i think it was maybe you know there are those that say one of the most extraordinary and exciting evenings in the history of television and the history of anything
 and you know you can go all over the world in some cases it was morning
 you go to asia you go to europe you go all over
 it was just record setting and here's the point we have to do it again
 we have to do it again
 and the reason we have to not only to do new things which we will and you know statutorily and we had all sorts of artificial witch hunts over our head
 can you imagine if we didn't have to go through that hoax
 i don't know that we would've done any better to be honest with you
 i think we've done more in two and a half years than any president ever first two and a half years
 but could you imagine what it could have been if we didn't have the witch hunt
 you said it
 he said it
 i won't say it because it's a harrell it's a terrible word
 so i will not say that this guy said if we didn't have the bullshit that's all
 no no
 could you imagine if we didn't have the time wasted the time and everything
 can you imagine
 and you know a friend of mine said maybe you wouldn't have done as well
 is that possible
 that can happen
 maybe we would have had too much time on our hands
 who knows
 but i can say nobody in their first two and a half years has done anywhere close to what we not being what we not me what we've all done
 it's true
 the unemployment rate among african americans is the lowest in the history of our country
 unemployment among hispanic americans where we're doing really well you know why
 because they want a strong border
 they want it because they understand the border better than anybody
 they want that strong border
 they want that wall that's being built right now
 they want that wall and they really do
 they understand the border better than anybody and they don't want criminals coming in
 they don't want crime coming they don't want to lose their jobs
 they like the fact that their salaries are going up their wages are going up they understand it better
 so hispanic american the best unemployment numbers in our history asian americans the best unemployment numbers in our history
 and likewise women 74 years
 so i'm sorry women i let you down
 it's not in our history but we're going to be there very soon
 we're going to be there very soon
 women are doing incredibly and women… the men are going to get angry
 sorry men
 whoa look at all those signs
 women for trump
 wow thank you
 that's a lot of signs
 you remember last election donald trump will never ever get the women
 then we got this tremendous number of women
 we got this tremendous number of women and during the election night they say what's going on
 you know it's called suppression polls
 suppression
 polls are just as fake as the news itself but women filled 60 and i'm sorry to tell you this men they're going to sue me for discrimination now
 women fill 60 of all of the new jobs created last year
 women took 60 what's wrong with you men
 what's wrong with you
 but the radical democrats are trying to destroy all of our country's tremendous achievement and our country's tremendous success
 unprecedented
 we've had unprecedented success
 leaders come in from other countries prime ministers presidents kings queens dictators
 sometimes i hate to say it dictators and they all start off by saying mr
 president i'd like to congratulate you on the incredible economy that you've created
 the greatest anywhere in the world by far
 and sadly china who i have a very good relationship with president xi i really like him
 but china has had… yesterday it was announced the worst year in 27 years
 we've had the best and if our opponent ever got into office instead of being up 62 instead of those 401ks of yours being up 60 70 80 90 crash big crash
 you would have had a crash the likes of which we have never seen before if they got in office
 because we freed up our country we freed up our economy especially with regulation cuts but also with those big beautiful tax cuts
 we freed it up
 the leading voices of the democrat party are left wing extremists who reject everything our nation stands for
 but again i have to tell you this vote was so big
 i have to thank many of the democrats
 i mean that was amazing
 no no i really do
 i respect it
 i really do
 that was a slaughter but many of those people that voted for us this afternoon in somewhat of a sneak attack a real sneak attack many of those people that voted for us were democrats and i want to thank them because they did the right thing for our country
 republicans know that america is the greatest force for peace and justice in the history of our world
 but these left-wing ideologues see our nation as a force of evil
 the way they speak so badly of our country
 they want to demolish our constitution weaken our military eliminate the values that built this magnificent country
 you have to look at some of their recent comments which are never talked about
 when you see the four congress women
 oh isn't that lovely
 i'll give you just a couple i've had pages and pages but we don't want to bore you
 we don't want to go too long
 but we have to give a couple because that's the great thing about live television
 they can't cut it
 representative ilhan omar of a really great state i almost won the first time in decades and decades minnesota
 greg stanton
 by the way i keep hearing how much enthusiasm is in the radical left
 i don't think they have enthusiasm
 they're just fighting with each other
 we have all of the enthusiasm
 he goes home now to mommy and he gets reprimanded and that's the end
 sorry mommy
 sorry mom
 didn't mean to embarrass your mom
 but it's true we have the enthusiasm folks
 look at this
 look at this
 and by the way thousands and thousands of people outside and people that couldn't get in thousand
 we've got all the enthusiasm
 they're fighting each other
 they've gone so far left nobody wants to even think about it
 so representative omar blames the united states for the terrorist attacks on our country saying that terrorism is a reaction to our involvement in other people's affairs
 she smeared us service members involved in black hawk down
 in other words she slandered the brave americans who were trying to keep peace in somalia
 omar minimized the september 11th attacks on our homeland saying some people did something
 i don't think so
 some people did something
 yeah some people did something
 all right
 she pleaded for compassion for isis recruits attempting to join the terrorist organization
 she was looking for compassion
 omar laughed that americans speak of al-qaeda in a menacing tone and remark that you don't say america with this intensity
 you say al-qaeda makes you proud
 al-qaeda makes you proud
 you don't speak that way about america
 and at a press conference just this week when asked whether she supported al-qaeda that's our enemy
 that's our enemy
 they are a very serious problem that we take care of but they always seem to come along somewhere
 she refused to answer
 she didn't want to give an answer to that question
 omar blamed the united states for the crisis in venezuela
 i mean think of that one and she looks down with contempt on the hardworking american saying that ignorance is pervasive in many parts of this country
 and obviously and importantly omar has a history of launching vicious antisemitic screens
 when she talked about the evil israel and it's all about the benjamins
 not a good thing to say
 so that's omar
 that's omar
 and by the way many other things all you have to do is press the right button on your beautiful screen and you'll see thing after… you didn't hear this over the last two days or did you hear anybody talk about this
 her colleague representative rashida tlaib agreed with omar's characterization of 911 and said that members of congress who support israel forgot what country they represent
 and tlaib also used the f word to describe the presidency and your president
 that's not nice even for me
 she was describing the president of the united states and the presidency with the big fat vicious the way she said it vicious f-word
 that's not somebody that loves our country
 representative alexandria ocasio-cortez
 check out her scores by the way with her green new deal the green new deal
 where did that come from
 she's conducted outrageous attacks against men and women of law enforcement she compared american border agents managing a humanitarian crisis that i always said was a humanitarian crisis and they said it was manufactured
 they don't say it was manufactured and we're stopping it and i want to thank mexico
 they've got 21000 soldiers now stopping people from coming into our country
 but cortez somebody said that's not her name it's… they said that's not her name sir
 i said no no i don't have time to go with three different names
 we'll call her cortez
 too much time
 takes too much time
 so cortez also she said essentially nazis are running concentration camps and when mike pence went down just a few days ago with members of congress and the media and you looked at those so-called horrible concentration camps they said wow these places a clean
 wow
 they have air conditioning they have water
 and you know to be honest it's not like they came and we want to take care of people
 we got to straighten out our immigration laws
 you know in a very short period of time if the democrats would give us a few votes we could solve the immigration problem and it would be so great
 it would be so great
 but these kids and these people come from rough places
 and i'll tell you what some of them said we've never lived like this before
 they have water they have air conditioning they have things that they've never seen
 and we listen to her talking about drinking water from toilets which was a lie which was a lie
 cortez said that illegal immigrants are more american than any person who seeks to keep them out ever will be can you believe that
 that's what she say
 she described contemporary america that's you that's me that's all of us as garbage garbage a garbage
 remember deplorables right
 that sounds worse
 i think that's worse but we'll save it for whoever's going to be the nominee and right now sleepy joe's not looking too good pocahontas
 pocahontas is gaining a little bit because we probably use the pocahontas a little bit too early but that's okay
 we'll bring it out of retirement very soon
 they have a new one who knocked the hell out of biden during the debate
 he said i wasn't prepared for that question
 that's not a good answer
 can you imagine
 and according to the polls i won every single debate republican and against hillary
 can you imagine
 those are the polls
 they won't admit that
 many many polls
 but can you imagine if i said uh-oh i'm sorry i wasn't prepared for that question
 i'm gone
 that's the end of trump
 he's not prepared
 he's not mentally prepared that's his problem
 but everybody that knows him knows that
 but no harris hit him with the pretty easy question on busing
 what i would say that's pretty easy and he choked
 he choked
 and then he said ah yeah i'm sorry i ran out of time
 i ran out of time he ran out of time
 and then you have a young guy buttigieg buttigieg
 they're saying how to say his name buut-ih-jij
 he's a beauty
 he runs a failed city
 his city is doing so badly
 mike pence was the governor of that state
 i said how was he as the mayor
 mike is one of the nicest human beings you'll ever meet
 and mike said he never did a good job i'm so shocked to see him running
 okay
 and then he goes back home and african americans literally were so angry at him for the lousy job and he's supposed to be like a hot young star if that's a hot young star i guess i just don't no star anymore
 that is not as star
 that's not a star
 buut-ih-jij you say buut and then add ih-jij buttigieg
 i don't see him dealing with president xi of china
 i don't see him meeting successfully with kim jong-un
 i don't see him dealing and nobody has been tougher with russia than donald trump
 i don't know see him dealing with vladimir putin
 and we have good relationships with them and many others except now we're no longer the suckers
 like with nato we protect europe
 we spent hundreds of billions of dollars and they're not paying their fair share
 so last year i went and said folks sorry you got to pay your fair share
 16 years was going like this
 the contribution and now it's like a rocket ship 100 billion
 i said to him great people 28 nations including the us i said to him listen we're taking care of you
 you screw us on trade and you don't pay your military bills
 this is not a good deal for the united states
 so we're taking care of trade
 we want to do it nice and slow and easy
 you know we got a world balance but european union is terrible to us on trade terrible
 frankly they're as tough or tougher than china just smaller in numbers
 that's the only difference
 with china 507 billion dollars a you look over the years for many many years they've been taken
 and guys like biden say uh-oh we'd them them
 and he was there eight years we'd stop that
 no trump is stopping it
 trump is stopping it
 representative ayanna pressle
 is she related in any way to elvis
 i don't know
 who knows
 you never know
 she thinks that people with the same skin color all need to think the same or military
 you know they're attacking a single man standing there with a camera who never got hit and never hit back before in his life that
 they're very brave
 they always show up with a mask and they're covered
 because then they go home to mom and dad
 they don't want mom and dad to know where they were
 but they always attract people that really can't defend themselves very well
 right
 they're attacking this group
 they're not attack north carolina
 that's for sure
 so these congresswomen their comments are helping to fuel the rise of a dangerous militant hard left but that's so they are very evil
 they're hitting people over the head with sticks and i mean sticks
 i mean bats even they're whacking people with bats
 they're very brave
 they always show up with a mask and they're covered because then they go home to mom and dad
 they don't want mom and dad to know where they were
 but they always attract people that really can't defend themselves very well
 right
 they're attacking this group
 they're not attack north carolina
 that's for sure
 so these congresswomen their comments are helping to fuel the rise of a dangerous militant hard left but that's okay because we're going to win this election like nobody's ever seen before
 and tonight i have a suggestion for the hate filled extremists who are constantly trying to tear our country down
 they never have anything good to say
 that's why i say hey if they don't like it let them leave
 let them leave
 let them leave
 let them leave
 they're always telling us how to run it how to do this how to the… you know what
 if they don't love it tell them to leave it
 i don't know
 and i'll watch i'll go back to the oh sir that was so controversial sir
 no i'm just saying it's their choice
 they can come back when they want but you know they don't love our country i think in some cases they hate our country
 and it's so angry even yesterday they went on the stage
 i said let me watch this
 and the anger they were trying to be nice but it's hard
 it's hard for them to do that
 that choice for every american has never been more clear
 that's true
 the democrat agenda is anti worker anti jobs anti citizen anti-family and anti common sense
 with the exception of all of those democrats that voted for us today we'll give them up okay
 they're fine they're fine
 they are fine and you'll lose to them it's different
 it's okay
 it's called normal political back and forth
 but i want to tell you something the democrats are being violent so vicious moving so far left it's out of control
 it's out of control
 the republican agenda is pro-worker pro-jobs pro-family pro-growth and 100 pro-american
 so we're thrilled tonight to be joined by several north carolina republican leaders
 really great people
 they've been so helpful to me and they're doing an incredible job
 lieutenant governor dan forest lieutenant governor
 north carolina treasurer dale folwell
 greenville mayor pj connelly i hear he does a good job pj
 and north carolina gop chair michael whatley incredible ncaa wrestling champion great guy
 he wanted to stay back
 i said you sure you don't want to come
 i do want to come but i really want you to win today if you don't mind
 i said okay you better stay back
 if i see you here i'm going to be very angry
 and they did their job didn't they
 this man is from the great state of ohio congressman jim jordan
 we're going to do this quickly but it's just important that you get out and vote they're two great people
 i want to introduce the next member of congress from north carolina's third congressional district just won a great race dr
 greg murphy
 greg is a winner
 so you know greg would be great on jobs all the things you want tough on crime strong on borders pushing the wall he'll be pushing it like nobody
 we're building the wall but we're pushing it
 it's like pulling teeth
 we've got six lawsuits on the wall we've won two of them we're going to win others
 but you think it's easy don't you folks you think this is easy
 but we're building a lot of wall and we hope if we can win that final one it's so important it's going before the supreme court we'll have over 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year
 so go out get greg elected
 great victory by the way that was a great primary and a great victory
 that same day there's another crucial election in north carolina's 9th… right you know what we're talking about
 9th i know it's not here but it's very close right
 9th congressional district
 the democrat in the race is an ultra liberal named dan mccready he wants to take away your guns he wants to raise you taxes he doesn't care about borders he likes open borders
 and he really admires socialism i don't think that works too well in north carolina
 doesn't work too well in our country
 we're joined tonight by the republican candidate who is really a special man a great man he's going to be a great great congressman dan bishop
 dan
 thank you dan
 thank you dan
 and he will indeed defend your values your family and he will always defend our second amendment unlike the opponents
 they're really into destroying our second amendment
 who've been violently operating for more than 10 years we got them all we think they are no good
 with conducting brutal medieval style killings you know what medieval style is
 okay
 little pieces little pieces little pieces medieval style including the dismemberment of their victims and they enjoyed every minute of it
 these are sick people
 when i call them animals nancy pelosi said how dare he used that name
 these are human beings
 i don't think they're human beings
 most of those indicted were in our country illegally 19 to be exact 19 of 22
 think of that they want to protect… these are savage beasts these are savage killers and they should've been brought out a long time ago by the obama administration
 we're bringing ms-13 out by the thousands getting them the hell out of our county
 and when you read about deportation and sunday we've got a lot of people on sunday but we have a lot of people… and we're always shooting for the bad ones first
 which makes sense right but when you hear about that we always want to get… and by the way do you know how dangerous it is for these ice agents these ice and border patrol
 but ice they go into a nest they call it a nest a nest of these killers
 they're tough they're smart and you know what they're great patriots they love our country
 the danger that they have is incredible
 and i just want to salute… and i have to tell you i want to salute ice and border patrol and i want to support and salute law enforcement in the united states
 these are great people
 these are great people and they don't get the credit that they deserve but you know what
 i tell them all the time you have no idea how much the american people the american public you have no idea how much they love you and respect you law enforcement
 in the recent democratic debate every single candidate everyone biden was a little bit slower with the hand it didn't work so well
 they raised their hand in favor of giving free government healthcare
 they raised their hand in giving a lot of other things that i don't think you're going to be happy with illegal aliens will be very nicely covered
 how about california they just approved a 100 million
 they just approved 100 million to take care of the needs of illegal immigrants and then you look on the sidewalks of los angeles the sidewalks of san francisco nancy pelosi's district nobody's ever seen anything like it in the history of our country what's happening there
 so if you don't want democrats to raid your healthcare to steal away your money to bankrupt your country then you have a choice you must vote republican
 all american citizens including millions and millions of legal immigrants who work hard to come into our country who study who wait on line sometimes for 10 years and who respect our laws and follow the rules they deserve a government that is loyal to them
 they work hard
 you can't say you love our country if you want to destroy it through open borders open borders are a disaster
 human trafficking the first time i heard as a politician human trafficking nobody talks about it it sounded almost like an ancient crime many many years ago hundreds of years thousands of years ago human trafficking it's the worst now throughout the world because of the internet it's the worst it's ever been
 and the worst treated of all children but it's women women the democrats want to do nothing about it
 human trafficking is worse than it ever has been in the history of the world not just… this is not a united states problem this is all over the world
 human trafficking it's a terrible terrible thing and we got to solve it
 most of it comes through in this country our southern border where we don't have the wall
 they're not going through our points they're not going through areas where we have security where we have guards where we have gates where we have all sorts of equipment no they ride through the desert and they make a left where you don't have the wall
 it's so simple everybody knows it
 the democrats all know it because five years ago before i was here they all wanted it
 now they don't want it you know why they don't want it
 for political reasons and you know what it's going to cost them a lot of points in the election i think probably cost them the election itself
 just lastly democrats also support deadly sanctuary cities which release violent criminal aliens onto our streets
 where we just picked up these 22 thugs these 22 monsters we just picked him up in where los angeles
 sanctuary city wonderful sanctuary city
 thom tillis senator recently introduced a bill to give american victims the right to pursue sanctuary cities and hold them accountable for the thousands of lives they have shattered they've shattered these lives
 thank you very much thom
 every nation has the right to establish and enforce immigration rules in it's national interest it's very simple isn't it
 it's common sense it's so simple and the voters understand that
 we expect that those who seek to join our society will obey our laws revere our constitution cherish our history support themselves financially and embrace our american values and love our american flag
 we believe in an immigration system based on merit merit where they come in
 we have so many companies coming in automobile companies companies of all types and we need workers
 we actually need workers
 we have the lowest unemployment rate that we've had in 51 years soon it'll be the lowest ever
 we need workers but they have to come in where they can help our country
 they have to come in based on merit and we're putting in bills and let's see what happens
 otherwise we'll just wait til we win back the house win the senate win the presidency and we'll vote
 democrats have never been farther outside of the mainstream
 they're going crazy folks they're going crazy
 more than 130 democrats in congress have signed up for bernie sanders total government takeover of healthcare isn't that nice
 this is one of the great… it won't happen he knows that
 the guy never passed the bill he did nothing
 he's actually not even a democrat isn't he an independent
 i don't know he's running but… he missed his time
 hey bernie let me save you a lot of time and effort bernie you missed your time
 it got taken from you four years ago bernie
 not doing too well
 he's not doing too well but that's okay
 i got to hand it to him he's up there ranting and raving and going like a lunatic
 i said to our first lady the other day i was watching bernie and he's screaming his hair's all crazy i'm going to do this i'm going to do that no more college loans no more cost for anything
 nothing you're not going to pay for anything
 he's desperate now he's desperate
 you don't have to pay for anything
 i joke i said and everybody will get a free rolls-royce every family gets a free rolls-royce every family
 and the media said donald trump is exaggerating
 he knows that they're not getting a rolls-royce
 i'm sorry don't put it
 don't put that i said free rolls royce
 but bernie's desperate now i watch him up there it's a sad situation
 but i think they're all sad when you get right down to it
 for instance we're in this incredible state north carolina that you have your best economy that you've ever had
 forget the country for a second you have the best economy you've ever had you have your best unemployment numbers you had the most people working than at any time in the history of your state you have your best black unemployment numbers best hispanic unemployment numbers best women unemployment numbers best asian unemployment numbers
 whoever the opponent is what are they going to do is just say north carolina i'm going to do a great job
 you have the best numbers in the history of our country in your state so i don't know and we won by a lot
 and we won by a lot i was telling mike i was telling my son eric trump and lara's here y the way who was born in north carolina
 they do a good job
 lara do you love this state
 and her brother's here i have to tell you he went to this college
 and brad parscale is here the worlds tallest campaign manager in the history of the world
 he's the tallest in the history but most importantly he's the best
 the worlds tallest manager but he's the best manager
 thank you brad
 great job
 and he just told me our poll numbers are through the roof he just told me that so i'll take that
 we are a year and a half away but we're doing well you see it
 you'd know you'd be the first to know
 number one you wouldn't be here you wouldn't be here
 we haven't had an empty seat in any event i don't believe that we've ever been to i don't think we've ever had… we always have people we haven't had an empty seat
 you look anywhere north carolina ohio no matter where we go we pack it and we have thousands and thousands of people we put screens outside
 i know tonight's not so good we got a hundred degrees out but you still have thousands of people out there
 we could have sold this arena out you know that
 we could have sold this arena out tonight 10 times can you believe that
 10 times
 i think that's like a poll that's like a poll because when biden goes out i see sleepy joe and he says they had 115 people show up 115 people
 that's our first row
 the democratic record on healthcare is one of deception and destruction the last administration said a lie
 if you like your plan you can keep your plan if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor 28 times a total lie
 my administration is defending your sacred right to choose the doctor and the plan that you want and we are offering plans up to 60 cheaper than obamacare and a lot of people are starting to figure that out
 better healthcare
 and we'll also always protect… you have to remember this you ready because they give us a bum rap
 patients with preexisting conditions are protected by republicans much more so than protected by democrats who will never be able to pull it off
 preexisting conditions and you know the job we've done on healthcare it's not talked about but we're also doing something
 it's been phenomenal we have 180 million people right now really happy on private plans and you know what they're going to be taken away
 under the democrats plan all of those people that are thrilled where they went out and negotiated cross state lines all of the things they did they went out negotiated great private plans it's all going to be taken away from you under this plan
 now i only hope they don't change because we're talking too soon we got a year and a half left
 it's like when i called pocahontas pocahontas i should've waited six months because she then went out and got that test
 1024th and i've always said i have more indian blood in me than she has in her and i have none
 i have none but it's more than she has 1024
 i brought it up too soon so i don't talk about it anymore but if she should be the candidate which i tend to doubt but if she should be we'll bring it up again and i think it will be very successful
 1024 how about this i was driving her crazy so she went out and hired a guy to check the blood
 i'm sure he had a lot of fun doing that
 he checked her blood and found out that many many many many many many years ago there could have been somebody and he could have been indian
 and then the indians got together and they said we don't want her
 we want trump we want trump they want trump
 we've taken historic action to fight the opioid epidemic what a problem and just today it was just announced before i came in that drug overdose deaths… we're working so hard on this including our vice president including our first lady including everybody in the trump administration it's dropped for the first time in more than 30 years it's gone down
 first time it was a big problem
 and in north carolina and we're far from finished it's a big problem it declined 8 last year
 that's a lot because it was just going up like a rocket
 virtually every top democrat also now supports late term abortion ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up until the moment of birth
 well then you have the gentleman from… our governor from virginia so we're talking about late term he's talking about the baby is born before the mother makes the decision
 that's the first i've heard of it that's the first most of you have heard of it and then they pass legislation in various states saying that's okay
 this is a baby that's born this isn't late term
 this is a baby that's born
 nobody's ever heard anything like that nobody's ever seen anything like it
 nobody's ever seen anything like it
 and that actually when he had the scandal that became can you believe it
 the second biggest story
 can you believe that how important it is and yet that was the second biggest story and what a shame when that's the second biggest story
 what happened to our values
 republicans believe that every life is a sacred gift of god
 that's why i've asked congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion of babies
 democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion intolerance and division
 the republican party is the party for all americans and american values
 we are the party of the american worker the american family and we are the party of the american dream
 this is the proud banner the republican party will carry into the republican national convention next summer in the great city of charlotte north carolina
 don't disappoint me that should be good for at least 10 points right
 these are some of the greatest ladies i see them in ohio and florida
 we love you too thank you really
 how many have you been to just out of curiosity
 what's the number
 all but two i've done hundreds of them
 and then they say women don't like trump i think they do
 now i see them they're great
 great ladies you're great
 it's interesting with women so women want to have a strong military protection they want to have strong borders they want to have strong law enforcement they want to have great education they want to have low taxes for their family not high taxes
 they want to have all the things that we talk about why wouldn't they want trump more than anybody else
 the other side is going to go the opposite
 and they did in the last election and we're doing a lot better
 the difference is the last election i was a successful businessman running for president i said i was going to do things
 and by the way really successful
 i'm going to show you something someday soon i'm going to show you something
 they say he was really successful he wasn't successful he's really smart or he's really stupid but he's trying to take over the world
 they have so many messages he's really stupid then next week donald trump has a sinister plot to take over the world he can't be too stupid because they actually think it's working
 i saw one of these so-called comedians the other day and he's a pretty respected comedian he said he's not leaving
 i'm telling you he's not leaving he'll never live
 he'll win this election and in 24′ i'm telling you he's not leaving
 he's going to stay
 so we did through our friend dan scavino we did a time magazine cover
 i was on so many times i don't even read this thing and it says trump 2014 2018
 but it says 20 here's where we go we start at 16 we go to 20 we go to 24 did you see it
 then it says 28 32 36 40 42
 no we don't need any more time
 we don't need any more time we need one more
 a senator came to my office sir i'm six foot seven i'm great
 i'm six foot seven so i can give you great advice
 i said senator i'm one for one but it happened to be the president
 and now i want to be two for two two for two
 two for two so we have 16 we have 20 we have 24 and you know what's very interesting though
 they were really people out there think i'm not leaving can you believe it
 hey maybe that is a good idea let's think about it
 watch you want to drive them crazy they're going to go crazy
 all i have to do is say let's think about it
 they're going to go crazy
 no i promise 2024 i leave
 by that time just so you know by that time our country will be so well seated it will be so strong like never ever in our history
 but everything that we built low taxes strong military taking care of our vets all of the things we've done can be decimated very quickly if the wrong person gets in especially now
 i've always said 2016 was the most important election maybe in the history of our country a lot of people felt that
 so i don't know i can't say this is more important what we did was a miracle
 not to us it wasn't but a lot of people said it was the greatest election we've ever had
 there's never been anything like it never been such excitement
 never been such excitement
 but you know what if we don't win in 2020 everything that we've done seriously though everything that we've done your 401's are going to crash the whole thing it's going to come down like a stack of cards
 so in a certain way let's say this is of equal importance by that time we'll have values instilled we'll have free enterprise instilled people are working now
 we have the lowest food stamps that we've had in many years lowest food stamps because people are working
 so i really think it's at least equal it's equal maybe it's a little less who the hell knows
 i just know this it can disappear very very quickly
 we have to get out we have to vote
 that's why i'm starting early can you believe it
 we have less… i see all these clowns on television i say i guess we have to counteract them a little bit but this is not what you want running none of them this is not what you want running this incredible country of ours
 every day we make good on the motto promises made promises kept
 i've had people back there that don't like me and somebody said very nicely that he's actually made certain promises and he's actually kept more promises than he's made
 it's true
 i've done things that i never… i never said we were going to get as an example with our vets that we going to get joyce that we were going to have the ability to fire people that don't treat our vets properly
 we can fire them now
 they've been trying to get that for 44 years joyce had been trying to get practically from the beginning joyce's so simple and yet they never got it nobody got it through
 we're good at getting things through
 we've done more than we said we would
 a man i know who i don't like a businessman very very very successful one of the most successful but i don't like him never liked him
 he never liked me by the way
 in fact i would go a step further he cannot stand me
 and i saw him about two months ago and he came up to me i said how are you doing
 very warm hey how you doing
 let's get out of here
 and he said i'm doing good you're doing good
 i said yeah
 i said you don't like me and i don't like you
 i never have liked you and you never have liked me but you're going to support me because you're a rich guy
 and if you don't support me you're going to be so goddamn poor you're not going to believe it
 and he said to me mr
 president
 he calls me mr
 president everybody calls me mr
 president it's true it's a funny thing
 he said mr
 president you're right i'm supporting you i think you're doing a great job
 and maybe we didn't get along
 but it's not like he has a choice he has no choice
 and on top of that it's a good choice because we've done the right thing
 and it is funny with the name mr
 president i have friends really good friends and they've always called me don donald d they call me anything and you lose all your friends when you're president because they're all afraid to talk to you does that make sense
 no it's true
 except for these six seven ladies up here they always talk
 they're not intimidated
 no it's true i have guys i have wonderful friends new york developers tough guys smart guys they're rich they're this that
 i have middle of the road i have poor i have everybody
 i have poor guys middle of the road and rich guys doesn't matter
 rich guys call up mr
 president how are you sir
 it's richard
 oh good rich hey richard loosen up
 this is a guy who used to hey don how you doing
 let's go to dinner
 now you're sir is everything… you're doing good sir
 i said richard call me donald like you always did call me donald
 always call me donald
 okay thank you donald thank you very much
 and then two minutes later mr president it's been so great to… i lost all my friends
 they've tightened up they've choked
 you know what that is they choked
 they can't breathe because people have such respect for the office of the presidency they have respect for the office of the president
 they have respect for our country again our country is respected again
 we've confirmed more than 125 federal judges to apply the law as written including two supreme court justices neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh
 we've launched a historic initiative to reduce the price of prescription drugs and last year i'm so proud of this because we have no help from the democrats
 last year for the first time in over 50 years drug prices went down
 and that was for a reason
 to give former prisoners a second chance at life we passed groundbreaking criminal justice reform
 it's a big thing prisoners they've gotten out of jail and they never had an economy like this
 we did a lot of things because they get out jail they don't have a chance
 they always go back most of the time
 now they're coming out and we have programs but most of all we have this great economy where people are hiring prisoners and you have to see the reviews they're getting they getting phenomenal reviews
 it's a beautiful thing it's a beautiful thing what's happening with prisoners they get out and they can actually get a job and that's what's happening and we're very proud of them
 we're expanding opportunities zone so that no american is left behind it's one of the great successes the opportunity zones
 nobody talks about it it's one of the great successes
 and thanks to our pledge to america's workers private sector partners will provide apprenticeships and job training to 9 million americans isn't that nice
 whenever i hear that word apprentice i say i love that word that was a good show
 they figured you know what we'll do we'll get arnold schwarzenegger to take my place that didn't work out too well
 that didn't work out too well we had 14 seasons think of that the apprentice
 i've proudly signed for bi-partisan human trafficking laws securing 400 million dollars to support victims of human trafficking
 and we have secured soon to be three years record funding for our military
 we want to cut budgets but this is beyond budget
 i withdrew the united states from the horrible one-sided disgusting iran nuclear deal and iran is a different country today than it was
 my administration proudly recognized the true capitol of israel and opened the american embassy in jerusalem
 that was some day they all said many many presidents have said we're going to do it
 then they never did
 i know why because the pressure on them was enormous not to do it
 and then on top of it a couple of months ago i just approved the golan heights for israel
 the golan heights another thing
 52 years they tried to do that they didn't get it done so we're doing good
 we also recognize the legitimate government of venezuela and we condemn those that want to stop freedom in that country and other countries
 tonight we renew our resolve that america will never be a socialist country will never ever be a socialist country it just won't happen
 a vote for any democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the american dream
 frankly the destruction of our country that's what's going to happen
 take a look around their party is afflicted with an ideological sickness that protects foreign borders but refuses to protect our own borders
 think of it they fight all over though a lot of those people are coming back home folks they're coming back home a lot
 we defeated isis the caliphate in syria we're bringing our soldiers back home
 isis does not like me too much but i came here and it was a mess
 it was a mess
 i met with generals general believe it or not one general his name is raisin
 i said what's your name
 sir
 this guy's like out of a movie
 watch he's going to be famous after this but who cares
 what's your name
 and he goes sir my name is raisin
 i said raisin like you mean a little raisin

 yes sir it's my name that's what they call me
 what's your last name
 kane
 i said you mean your name is raisin kane
 i said raisin kane you're my kind of general
 let me talk to you raisin kane get over here
 and my previous general said it's going to be a long time before we take out the caliphate
 i said did raisin kane and a couple of other generals that were there these guys are central casting like from a movie except better
 they're stronger bigger tougher meaner and actually better looking in a certain way
 but they're like from a movie there is nobody in hollywood plays a role like this
 i said generals i've been told it's going take a year two years to get a 100
 remember i want to pull them out we're down to 1 and everyone went crazy explain that one
 but they said it was going to take a long time
 i said to raisin kane and the other generals general how long can it take
 they said sir one month
 i said what
 we're going to hit them from the front we're going to hit them from the back we're going to hit them from the sir we're going to hit them like they never got hit before we were never allowed to do this
 and we're not just going to hit them from our temporary base in syria sir we're going to hit him from iraq we're going to hit them from places that they never knew existed sir
 they'll be hit so goddamn hard sir they will be… thank you very much
 very shortly very very shortly it was over we had a 100 of the caliphate and these people we're screwing around for years
 obama president obama
 my generals did a great job i flew there i flew to iraq remember
 i'm an air force one and they notified me sir we're 45 minutes out sir
 we have to close all windows we have to turn off all lights in the plane sir
 all windows all lights have to be off sir
 we're turning off the lights outside and the runway light sir
 they going to be in a very dim… frankly if you're not at 30-year old pilot you can't see them because i went there i said i don't see any light pilot
 as we're landing i said i don't see
 and then i thought to myself think of it we've spent almost 8 trillion in the middle east and we got to turn off the lights of an airplane to land how bad is that
 they didn't do their job
 we did our job and the military did their job
 but we fight to short of just keep going we don't fight to win i fight to win
 i fight to win
 so we land in this big beautiful air force one and i'm saying major i don't see a runway
 yes sir it's right up ahead the guy's 30 years old or something
 they'll get me that they'll say majors aren't 30 maybe he's 35 whatever he is
 they're saying yes sir it's right there
 i don't see it major how about lifting up let's go around
 that's the last thing we want to do in that part of the world
 he said sir it's right there sir
 and we're landing and i still haven't seen a light
 but these guys we have the greatest pilots in the world we have the greatest military in the world we have the greatest equipment in the world

 i say anguilla anguilla you got to pay anguilla
 obama would go in make a speech leave
 i go in and make a speech i say let me speak to anguilla
 anguilla you got to pay your bills you're way behind
 so i would think that they should they should all like… when you hear they like me better i'm not doing my job
 it's true i'm not doing my job
 they did a poll on one of these networks and they would say donald trump is not liked in europe nearly as much as president obama
