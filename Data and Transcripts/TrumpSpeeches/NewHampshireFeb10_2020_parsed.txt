hello manchester and i am thrilled to be in the great state of new hampshire with thousands of hardworking patriots who believe in god family and country
 thank you
 thank you
 and i'll tell you what — we have more in this arena and i hate to say this to you… we have more than this outside of the arena trying to get in
 so if you'd like to give up your seat or where you're standing… sorry we couldn't get you seats but if you want to give it up let them come in you go out
 does anybody want to make that deal
 i don't think so
 but we have more in this arena and outside of this arena than all of the other candidates meaning the democrats put together and multiplied times fave
 and the fake news these guys will never report that
 they'll never report it
 they don't even like showing the crowd
 they always show my face
 they never show the crowd
 but you know what
 the people can hear the crowd
 the people can hear the crowd
 they know
 that is not the sound of 200 people
 one of their prime candidates today they worked a big deal
 they had exactly 104 people and the fake news said it was a nice crowd
 very nice
 if i had one empty seat here one empty seat in this massive arena they'd say he didn't sell out
 but you know what
 we have never had an empty seat from the day your future first lady and i came down the escalator
 never not one time
 and we have the biggest arenas in the country
 with your help on november 3rd we are going to defeat the radical socialist democrats
 we are going to win new hampshire in a landslide
 this is a truly incredible time for america
 we have the best economy we've ever had the most prosperity
 we have got the most prosperity we've ever had
 by the way we're going to keep it that way too if it's okay who was mumbling very distracting very distracting
 it's true
 you know it was very distracting
 i'm speaking and a woman is mumbling terribly behind me angry
 there was a little anger back there
 we're the ones that should be angry not them
 we're the ones that should be angry but we proudly declared that we are in the midst of the great american comeback
 our country is stronger today than ever before
 and the day after my address our good republicans in the united states senate voted to reject the outrageous partisan impeachment hoax and to issue a full complete and absolute total acquittal
 and it wasn't even close and i want to thank our republican senators and our republican house members
 they were tremendous
 in the house we won 196 to nothing and then we got three democrats
 and in the senate other than romney we got 52 to nothing 52 to nothing
 that's something and in one case we got 53 to nothing but i don't even count that to be honest
 the radical left's pathetic partisan crusade has completely failed and utterly backfired with 18 votes… think of that… 18 votes to spare with a lot of votes to spare
 and also very importantly as of today i… we because it's not we
 it's not i
 it's we
 we're all in this together
 we have the highest poll numbers that we have ever had
 thank you nancy very much
 thank you
 while the extreme left has been wasting america's time with this vile hoax we've been killing terrorists creating jobs raising wages enacting fair trade deals securing our borders and lifting up citizens of every race color religion and creed
 from our rural communities to our cities we are expanding the blessings of america to all of our citizens
 we added another 225000 new jobs last month alone
 amazing
 and i listened
 i watched
 i had all these experts
 they were saying yes i think 60000
 another one said 101000
 another one said 125
 another one was 118
 and then the number came out 225000
 pretty good
 pretty good
 we have destroyed the isis caliphate
 we killed the founder and leader of isis
 al-baghdadi is dead
 al-baghdadi is dead and we just took out the world's top terrorist qasem soleimani ending his evil reign of terror forever
 the fact is america is respected again
 it's been a long time
 but as we keep on winning washington democrats keep on losing their minds
 they're crazy
 that's why millions of registered democrat voters are leaving their party to join our movement
 they're joining our great republican party
 now i can't tell you what's happening tomorrow because you know you have some pretty strange election laws here right
 remember last time
 we won the primary tremendously
 we should have won the election but they had buses being shipped up from massachusetts hundreds and hundreds of buses
 and it was very very close even though they did but this year we have a great governor governor sununu
 great governor chris
 and now you get prosecuted if you do what they did so it should be a lot different
 but we have done great
 this has been an incredible state for us
 it's a state where the people are great just great people
 and we hear that there could be because you have crossovers in primaries don't you
 so i hear a lot of republicans tomorrow will vote for the weakest candidate possible of the democrats
 does that make sense
 you people wouldn't do that
 my only problem is i'm trying to figure out who is their weakest candidate
 i think they're all weak if you want to know the truth
 we proudly welcome and embrace voters of all parties and political persuasions who want to join our mission
 a very simple mission remember
 make america great again
 and then after we make it great again which we already have… we've had 141 days where the stock markets have reached their all-time historical high
 141 think about it
 out of three years 141
 and to me i view it differently
 well look at your 401ks
 i mean who is doing well with their 401k
 up 90
 up 104
 is there anybody doing badly with the 401k
 i'd like to not talk to that person
 does anybody have a 401k where they're doing badly please
 oh don't put up your hand
 i don't believe it
 nah the 401ks they're up 90 95
 i always tell this story
 people come up to me
 they say i want to thank you
 my wife thinks i'm a total loser sir
 she thinks i am the worst person with money with financial
 she thinks i'm just horrible
 in the last three years i'm up 94 sir
 she thinks i'm a total genius when it comes to finance
 she loves me again
 she didn't love me before sir
 she loves me again
 that tells you something about money doesn't it
 the first step to victory in november is tomorrow
 go send a message that republicans… and you can vote for the weakest candidate if you want
 don't worry about it
 i don't really think we actually have a candidate against us… that republicans are energized that we're united and that nine months from now we are going to take back the house of representatives
 we are going to hold the senate and we are going to keep the white house
 you know they always talk about the democrats
 they have enthusiasm right
 we have so much more enthusiasm than them
 it's not even close
 they're all fighting each other
 they're all going after each other
 you got them all over the place
 they don't know what the hell they're doing
 they don't know what they're doing
 they can't even count their votes
 we're thrilled to be joined tonight by many great leaders from across this state and this country great national leaders
 i want to thank our tremendous vice president mike pence who spoke earlier this evening
 and also with us our warrior senators the two people that wanted to be here
 they're going to be here tomorrow
 they're going to be here to get out the vote
 i don't think we have to worry too much about it but that's okay… and very highly respected senators lindsey graham and rand paul
 great guys
 warriors they're warriors
 hey lindsay and rand
 that's not bad
 can you imagine if you actually came from new hampshire what it would be

 that's not bad but they have been great
 all they do is they looked at everybody for the last couple of months and they said read the transcripts please
 read the transcripts
 but i want to thank you both very much
 two great people two great friends

 a very brave man… he took a bullet
 he got shot and he got up
 he was going to die that night
 i tell this story all the time
 his wife she was crying so much
 when he finally did awake i said well one thing i learned your wife loves you
 why do you say that
 because she was devastated
 i know many wives that don't get too upset
 his wife was devastated
 his family was devastated
 the doctor told me he didn't have a good chance but he's tough as hell and he's a really terrific friend
 he's a winner

 and haley
 thank you darling
 i retweeted you haley
 i retweeted you all over the place
 and all together we're building the world's most prosperous economy and the most inclusive society anywhere in the world
 it's a great thing
 it's a great thing
 since my election america's gained 7 million new jobs
 the unemployment rate has hit the lowest rate in half a century
 the average unemployment rate under my administration is lower than any previous administration in the history of our country
 you believe that one
 that's pretty amazing
 that's pretty amazing
 the unemployment rate among african americans hispanic americans and asian americans has reached record lows all time never been lower than what it is now
 and by the way our poll numbers with african americans with hispanic americans with asian americans the other side is getting a little nervous because they are like rocket ships
 they're going up
 african american youth unemployment is so important
 it was a horrible number a few years ago
 you remember it was a really terrible thing was happening
 it's just reached the lowest time in the history lowest the best number in the history of our country
 and african american poverty numbers have hit the lowest rate ever recorded
 wages for african american workers have increased by 2400 per year also a record
 and you know this
 for decades the democrat party has betrayed african americans
 they betrayed us all
 they betrayed all of us
 but we're delivering for african americans
 we're delivering for asian americans and hispanic americans like nobody has ever done
 we are fighting for great jobs great schools great healthcare and a truly great future for our country and for them
 we are the party of equal opportunity for all americans
 thank you
 to support working families we've reduced the cost of childcare expanded paid leave and given 40 million american families an average of 2200 more in their pockets thanks to the republican child tax credit
 who would have thought that
 we have cut more job killing regulations than any… you know this one
 so you go back four years eight years
 in one case longer than eight years
 we've cut more job killing regulations than any other administration in the history of our country and we're not finished
 we've ended the war on american energy
 they want to take our energy away
 they want to take our wealth away
 they want to give us wind
 wind
 if it blows wonderful
 if it doesn't blow you got problems
 wind
 they want to destroy our countrysides put windmills all over them
 watch your house go down in value
 you ever see what happens
 they build a windmill within distance of your house
 you could forget about your house
 you could just say well that was the end of that investment
 you want to see a bird graveyard go to the bottom of a windmill
 take a look
 it's a graveyard for birds
 they kill all the birds
 lowering utility bills and reducing prices at the pump that's what we're doing
 we are reversing decades of calamitous trade policies washington politicians… you know this
 they shuttered new hampshire factories
 you were one of the worst examples ever
 nafta what nafta to your communities i mean to your state is incredible
 shattered your communities and sacrifice your jobs on the altar of globalism
 we can forget globalism
 we want to take care of our country
 new hampshire alone lost one in four manufacturing jobs following that twin disaster of nafta and china's entrance into the wto the world trade organization one of the truly bad deals ever made in the history of our country
 for decades politicians campaigned across this state promising to replace nafta
 they lied
 they never did it
 they never even tried to do it
 they wouldn't have been able to anyway
 it wasn't easy i will tell you that
 but then they got elected and they did absolutely nothing
 but i'm not like those other politicians
 i keep my promises
 we took care of it
 we took care of it
 you saw last month being bye-bye
 i say donald j
 trump bye-bye nafta
 we ended the nafta catastrophe and i signed the brand new us mexico canada agreement into law
 that's going to be great for our manufacturers our farmers
 great for everybody
 great for our workers
 the usmca will bring jobs back to new hampshire right where they belong
 they should have never left in the first place
 probably the number one reason i ran for office
 i'm one for one
 i have friends
 some of these great senators look at lindsey over there and look at rand
 these great senators
 sure i've run five times and i've won three
 and other senators said sir i've won seven times sir
 southern senator
 i won seven times sir and i've won five of those damn contests
 i said senator i ran once and i won just once
 and we're going to run twice and that's going to be it
 although they think we're going to run much more than that you know that right
 it scares the hell out of the fake news i will tell you
 they can't take a joke
 i also took the strongest ever action to confront china's massive theft of american jobs and our strategy worked
 massive tariff and tariff money is pouring in and has poured in poured in by the billions and billions
 we never took in 25 cents from china
 they ripped us so much you wouldn't believe it
 now they respect us again
 last month we signed a groundbreaking trade agreement with china that will defeat so many of our opponents
 the money that's pouring in people don't even believe it
 and by the way the virus they're working hard
 looks like by april in theory when it gets a little warmer it miraculously goes away
 i hope that's true but we're doing great in our country
 china i spoke with president xi and they're working very very hard and i think it's going to all work out fine
 rough stuff i tell you
 rough rough stuff but i think it's going to work out good
 we only have 11 cases and they're all getting better
 but our trade agreement with china will defend our workers protect our intellectual property and substantially boost exports of american made goods
 is that nice
 after years of building up other countries we are finally rebuilding our country
 on no issue of washington democrats more thoroughly sold out the american people than a thing called immigration right
 before i came into office the far left's policy of open borders allowed deadly drugs to flow freely into our country and that's what they want
 i see them campaigning right down the street
 it's really boring to watch but i try and watch
 no i have an obligation to watch really boring stuff
 but they want open borders
 they want thousands and thousands of people to pour into our country many of whom are not exactly what we're looking for okay
 i mean murderers rapists and some other things
 they're going to be poisoning our children with drugs including right here in new hampshire and you have one of the drug problems in the country
 and we brought it down 18 but we have to do better
 18
 washington democrats put the needs of illegal immigrants before the wellbeing of american citizens
 they want to let anyone into our country from all around the world
 just come on in folks we're going to give you free healthcare
 we're going to give you free education
 we're going to give you more than our vets are getting
 every family will get a free rolls royce
 you know i said that matt
 i said that to them and some of the fake news picked it up and they said president trump said every family coming into our country illegally gets a brand new free rolls royce
 he lied
 he lied
 he lied
 they gave me a pinocchio
 they don't get it matt do they matt
 actually they get it better than we understand
 they get it very well
 they get it
 they know what's happening
 and the wall is being built
 i will tell you the wall is being built
 and you know they went after us on everybody knows the wall is going up
 so what's happening
 you do know who's paying for the wall don't you
 right
 redemption from illegal aliens that are coming
 the redemption money is paying for the wall
 they're so sad to hear that because it's okay finally they go
 you have to understand an entire party is fighting
 they'll give me anything i want
 our military would rebuilt it
 2
2 it's really 2
5 trillion over a period of three years
 they give me anything but not 25 cents for the wall
 they said we like drones
 well drones don't keep people out
 drones are wonderful
 they fly around take pictures
 we're going to give you a drone
 no good
 so we now have built over 100 miles of wall
 and when we have that wall built you have to see what happens to the illegal aliens that don't come in
 i say they can't come in
 they don't come in
 so we up to over a hundred substantially more than a hundred miles of wall and we'll have close to 500 miles of wall in the very near future
 and by the way you have to see
 you wouldn't believe it
 you have to see what happens when that wall goes up
 you have to see the numbers change like magic
 they change like magic
 you ever hear the thing with all the modern technology all of the new computers the new genius the new everything cyber this cyber that two things never change right
 a wheel and a wall
 right
 a wheel and a wall
 they're going to have a lot of brilliant people working over the years
 they're never going to replace the wheel and they're never going to replace the wall and it's a high wall
 illegal immigrants coming in coming into our country illegally very few of them are getting in right now
 mexico has been terrific
 we have 27000 mexican soldiers on our border and the numbers went down 87 from this year and this time last year
 and for the amount of money washington democrats want to spend supporting illegal immigrants we could rebuild the cities in america
 we could rebuild our cities
 but i have something because people were screaming to me for the last four or five rallies read the snake
 the snake
 does anybody know what i'm talking about
 she knows
 she's been standing outside for four days no wonder
 and you look good i'll tell you what
 four days outside in the rain and snow
 look at these front row people
 these are warriors
 they're warriors too like my congressmen and senators
 i made minor changes
 they mentioned illegal immigration
 this is about immigration
 this was a song from the 1950s al green
 and they mentioned little changes to it that's okay
 but they mentioned illegal immigration right
 and i used to do this a lot and people couldn't get enough of it to be honest with you
 and i haven't done it for a while and i thought i'd do it tonight because you're on the eve of giving us an opponent and all of these people want open borders
 they want open borders and we don't want open borders
 we want very strong closed borders
 and we want people to come into our country but they want to come in through merit and we want them to come in legally right
 right
 through merit and legally
 right
 so we'll do this quickly
 this is illegal immigration
 it's called… oh listen to how quiet it is
 listen to how quiet
 now watch how quiet it gets
 gets so quiet
 but this is all about… i love you too
 that was a guy that said that but i love him too
 i love everybody
 ready
 so important
 illegal immigration
 on our way to work one morning down the path along the lake a tender hearted woman saw a poor half frozen snake
 his pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew
 poor thing she cried i'll take you in and i'll take care of you
 take me in oh tender woman take me in for heaven's sake
 take me in oh tender woman sighed the vicious snake
 she wrapped him up all cozy in a comforter of silk and laid him by her fireside with some honey and some milk
 she hurried home from work that night and as soon as she arrived she found that pretty snake she'd taken in had been fully fully revived
 take me in oh tender woman take me in for heaven sake
 take me in oh tender woman sighed that vicious snake
 she clutched him to her bosom
 you're so beautiful she cried
 but if i hadn't brought you in by now you truly would have died
 she stroked his pretty skin again and kissed him and held him tight
 but instead of saying thank you the snake gave her a vicious bite
 take me in oh tender woman take me in for heaven's sake
 take me in oh tender woman sighed the vicious snake
 i saved you cried the woman and you've bitten me but why
 you know your bite is poisonous and now i'm going to die
 shut up silly woman said the reptile with a grin
 you knew damn well i was a snake before you took me in
 got to come in legally and through merit
 under my administration we're fully taking care of our own citizens first including millions of african american and hispanic americans who are entitled to a government that protects their families and their communities
 in this region of the country alone last year ice officers… we love our ice officers
 the democrats don't like them
 the democrats don't like them
 ice officers are the toughest human beings and they love the country as much as anybody in this room
 last year alone they … in this room
 last year alone they arrested over 2000 criminal aliens charged or convicted of dangerous offenses including robbery rape and murder
 over 2000 accused of murder yet left wing politicians support sanctuary cities that release criminal aliens directly into the american community
 one of guests at the state of the union was american citizen jody jones
 i introduced him that night
 his beloved brother rocky was murdered by a criminal alien in california shot him eight times at close range wouldn't stop
 rocky's killer had been previously arrested many many times but under california's totally insane and outrageous sanctuary law authorities were ordered to set him free
 tragically left wing politicians in new hampshire tried to replicate california's disastrous policies
 last year the democrat controlled new hampshire house blocked legislation that would have banned sanctuary cities in your state
 and by the way you have a great governor chris sununu
 he's on top of it
 he's on top of it
 and his father is a great guy
 his father didn't like me too much a few years ago
 once i won i'm telling you he was so good
 he was as good
 he fought like hell for us all of us
 it's a great family and chris is doing a fantastic job
 if you want to shut down sanctuary cities if you want to protect your family and your loved ones you must vote republican in 2020 november
 and thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border we have reduced illegal border crossings eight straight months in a row
 illegal crossings are down now at record numbers and we've ended catch and release
 you know what catch and release is
 you catch an illegal alien by law
 you then take his name and address
 they don't have addresses
 what's your address
 what
 they don't have addresses
 they come into the country they don't have addresses
 so you take his name and then you have to release him into the country and you say we'll see you in four years for your court case
 we never see them
 they never come back
 we have seized record amounts of drugs
 we have deported record numbers of gang members ms-13 by the thousands
 and we have done more to secure the border of our country than any administration in history
 … does anybody know who won iowa
 i don't know
 maybe rander lindsey
 grant does anybody know who won
 lindsey you're a total pro
 nobody knows
 he said nobody
 flip a coin
 flip a coin
 flip a coin
 they're going to run your health care
 unbelievable
 nobody knows who won
 actually i think they're trying to take it away from bernie again
 i think bernie came in second
 can you believe it
 they're doing it to you again bernie
 they're doing it to you again
 we're saving your healthcare while these socialist democrats are trying to take away your healthcare
 we are making healthcare better and much much cheaper
 you've seen what we did
 we are protecting people with preexisting conditions and we always will
 the republican party always will
 always will
 and we got rid of the most unpopular thing in the healthcare world the individual mandate
 we had to pay a fortune not to have pay a fortune
 you paid a fortune not to pay a fortune for bad healthcare
 and we got rid of it saved a lot of money for a lot of people
 and we're stopping surprise medical bills and making everything transparent
 that's bigger than healthcare transparency and that'll go unfortunately into effect right around the election time
 it would be nice if we could get it earlier but it's all done
 it's all signed
 because when providers are required to show you what the prices are those prices are going to come tumbling down
 blood tests as an example one hospital has them for 53
 another hospital the same test 2415
 same exact test
 and it may even be better who knows
 we're approving more generic drugs than ever before at any time in the history of our country
 that's bringing prices down
 we are defending your right to keep the doctor and to keep your plan
 remember president obama you could keep your plan
 you could keep 28 times
 you can keep your doctor
 that didn't turn out very good
 we should impeach him for that
 why aren't we impeaching him
 28 times you can keep your doctor
 we should impeach president obama
 democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion socialism and blatant corruption
 the republican party is the party of the american worker the american family the american dream and the late great abraham lincoln right
 abraham lincoln
 republicans are fighting for citizens from every background every community and every walk of life
 we are the party of boundless optimism excitement energy and enthusiasm
 we love people
 we are asking all americans to join our incredible movement
 people are signing up left and right
 but if you want to vote for a weak candidate tomorrow go ahead
 pick one
 pick the weakest one you think i don't know who it is
 we are a big party with big ideas for the future
 very big
 we become a big party and an open-minded party and we're the party that people like
 we're the hot party and we're the party with all the enthusiasm
 we are fighting for school choice because no parent should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school
 right
 we pass criminal justice reform to give former prisoners a second chance at life
 most incredible thing that's happened
 prisoners never really had a shot
 they'd get out they couldn't get a job no matter what they did and they'd go back
 they'd go back to their ways
 i mean in many cases i guess they had no choice
 it was a disaster
 now they're getting out and because our economy is so good and because of what we've done with criminal justice reform and other things like opportunities zones et cetera they're getting jobs and employers are loving them
 they're doing great
 they're doing great
 they are doing great first time ever
 they're not going back
 to uphold the rule of law we have confirmed 191 federal judges who will interpret the constitution as written
 and as you know we've also confirmed two great new supreme court justices
 thank you very much
 thank you grant
 thank you lindsey
 thank you
 we have invested 2
2 trillion to rebuild the united states military as i said and i love saying it because we are funding for new hampshire the new hampshire army national guard readiness centers just a few miles from here in pembroke and in concord
 concord i love concord
 i love concord
 oh concord
 you know how famous concord is
 concord
 that's the same concord that we read about all the time right
 concord
 i love concord
 i recognized israel's true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem
 and we recognize israeli sovereignty over the golan heights been trying to do that for 52 years
 we got it done
 and for years you watched as your politicians … they really i mean they went out i'd like to apologize for the behavior of the united states
 no no
 we don't know we don't apologize anymore
 we don't apologize
 now you have a president who is standing up for america and we are standing up for the great people of new hampshire
 thank you
 at stake in our present battle is to survival actually of our nation
 if you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of americans have fought and died for to secure then we must devote everything we have toward victory november 3rd 2020
 only this way can we save the america we love and drain the washington swamp once and for all
 and i will tell you that swamp is much worse than i thought when i was out here innocently campaigning
 let's drain the swamp
 that swamp is a lot worse than anybody ever thought
