i want to thank you very much
 north carolina thank you very much
 i'm thrilled to back in the great city of charlotte where by the way we're having our convention
 i guess you heard that right
 with thousands of hardworking american patriots who love our country cherish our values respect our laws and always put america first
 eight months from now we're going to defeat the radical socialists
 we're going to win the great state of north carolina in a landslide
 we won it last time we're going to win it this time by even more
 and you know eric and lara named their daughter you know what her name is
 carolina carolina
 her name is carolina for a reason
 this is an incredible time for our nation
 our country is stronger than ever before
 and today we just had the largest one day increase in the stock market in history
 that's great
 that's great
 that was great
 you know our opponents were saying  oh maybe he's in trouble maybe the economy …  they'll do anything
 they'll do anything
 i'm sure they were thrilled
 do you think our opponents were thrilled when they saw the stock market today
 i don't think so
 by the way look at this
 look back there look at all of that press
 look at all them
 man i don't know if sleepy joe or bernie i don't think they have that much press
 bernie was going wild
 why would i be here tonight
 why would i be here
 he said why would i be here tonight
 we don't have the primary we've already won the thing you know
 i was going to say the you know what thing i held it back because they'll say horrible language
 he used horrible language today
 but we're doing fantastically
 there's never been a time where the republican party was so unified as it is now
 never never
 and you hear about enthusiasm for crazy bernie and that's true he does have some enthusiasm but much less than we have and a much smaller group of people too
 and there's not a lot of enthusiasm for biden
 i thought he gave up the presidency the other day because he said he's running for the senate
 i looked at the first lady i said  hey he's running for the senate
 and today he just said super thursday he's looking forward to super thursday
 jobs are booming in our country incomes are soaring poverty has plummeted confidence is surging and we have completely rebuilt the awesome power of a thing called the united states military
 every day for me and for you it's promises made promises kept
 one of the most important promises i made is right to this era
 you know we look at it it's the never ending wars in the middle east
 we're taking our soldiers we're bringing them back home
 we're not law enforcement
 we're bringing them back home
 american troops cannot be the policemen for the world or to create democracy in other nations that frankly probably don't want it
 the job of the american military is to secure and defend our country
 two days ago the unites states signed a deal with the taliban so that after 19 years of conflict and very close to 20 we can finally begin to bring our amazing troops back home
 after years of rebuilding foreign nations we are finally rebuilding our nation and taking care of our own american citizens and all of the things that we've done we've wiped out the terrorists we've done so much and you know what
 we're 8000 miles away
 you got a lot of big countries surrounding afghanistan you've got afghanistan itself
 the progress that was made was made possible by the extraordinary valor of our men and our women in uniform
 you know that
 we pay a special tribute and i know you pay it a special tribute to our great wounded warriors and those who made the ultimate sacrifice
 as we bring back our troops we are committed to ensuring that foreign terrorists are denied admission to america in the first place
 they're not coming here and if they do bad things happen to them
 we must keep radical islamic terrorists the hell out of our country
 by the way i have to say this you know you have thousands and thousands of people outside
 somebody was saying that if pocahontas any one of them sleepy joe he doesn't have that so he doesn't have a lot he has very small crowds but if sleepy joe or if any of them had a crowd one-tenth this size they go around talking about how big the crowd
 they never say that
 hey take your cameras and spin them around this big arena
 right now
 spin them around
 no fun to be a protestor at a trump rally but do we have a great time at a trump rally
 my administration has also taken the most aggressive action in modern history to protect americans from the coronavirus
 you know about this whole thing
 horrible
 including sweeping travel restrictions
 today we met with the big great pharmaceutical companies and they're really working hard and they're working smart and we had a great meeting today with a lot of the great companies
 they're going to have vaccines i think relatively soon
 and they're going to have something that makes you better and that's going to actually take place we think even sooner
 so a lot of good things are happening but we have strong borders and really our tough and early actions have really been proven to be 100 right
 we went out we're doing everything in our power to keep the sick and infected people from coming into our country
 we're working on that very hard
 we closed our borders very early
 i took a lot of heat for that
 remember when i closed the borders to certain areas of the world
 i took a lot of heat
 but there are fringe globalists who would rather keep our borders open than keep our infection think of it keep all of the infection let it come in
 and we're working with other countries
 in all fairness look it's a problem we're working with other countries
 remember this over the last long period of time the flu the common flu you know this right
 from 27000 to 70000 people get infected and many people die
 think of it 27000
 you lose 27000 people to the common flu
 it can be much more
 one year was much higher than the 70000 number
 those people died
 so when you lose 27000 people a year nobody knew that
 i didn't know that
 three four weeks ago i was sitting there i said what do we lose with the regular flu
 they said about 27000 minimum goes up to 70 sometimes even 80 one year it went up to 100000 people
 i said nobody told me that
 nobody knows that
 last year was approximately 36000 people died
 so we're working hard on it and we're going to come up with some really great solutions
 in the meantime we're stopping … only in north carolina
 only in north carolina
 it can only be
 how many people here are from south carolina by the way
 all right we love both places
 but that was from north carolina
 but just to finish up so we've made a lot of progress we've really done a great job with it
 we're keeping our borders strong
 my job is to protect the health of american patients and americans first and that's what i'll do
 washington democrats are trying to politicize the coronavirus denigrating the noble work of our public health professionals
 but honestly not so much anymore
 everyone appreciates these are the greatest professionals in the world at what they do
 we're actually helping a lot of other countries where they have some very very big problems
 so we have our professionals in constant touch i'm in constant touch with some of the leaders and helping them out
 but the political attacks from some of the democrats really must stop
 we've got to all work together on this one to safeguard our people
 we're going to safeguard our people the united states
 the united states is right now ranked by far number one in the world for preparedness
 earlier today when i met with the pharmaceutical companies things were discussed and learned honestly
 the media didn't know
 nobody knew
 they've never heard this before
 and we learned a lot and maybe that had the impact on the stock market
 who knows what happened but we're going to reduce and the severity of what's happening the duration of the virus
 we discussed all of these things
 we will bring these therapies to market as rapidly as possible
 and i have to say with a thriving economy the way it is and the most advanced health system on earth america is so resilient we know what we're doing we have the greatest people on earth the greatest health system on earth
 we have the greatest health system on earth
 the renewal of american strength over the last three years means at times of challenge we are the best prepared to rise to any occasion
 no country is better equipped than america to handle new threats and no people are more skilled talented tough or driven than americans
 and together we are in the midst of the great american comeback
 that's what it is
 last month we added 225000 new jobs in january alone
 that makes seven million jobs since the election
 we have destroyed the isis territorial caliphate and we killed the founder and leader of isis al-baghdadi
 he is dead
 and we took out the world's top terrorist qasem soleimani ending his evil reign on terror forever soleimani
 while the extreme left has been wasting time with vile hoaxes and delusional witch hunts we have been killing terrorists creating jobs raising wages and lifting up american citizens of every race religion color and creed
 tomorrow voters in states across the nation will head to the polls for super tuesday not super thursday
 no he said super thursday
 you can't do these things
 can you imagine if i said super thursday
 it would be over right
 i would be over
 no matter how good you are at certain things you can't as an example a name like sleepy joe he's constantly naming the wrong state
 it's great to be in the state of ohio
 no no no i'm sorry you're in north carolina
 no no
 joe
 do you ever see them run up with a sign no no north carolina joe
 once that happens you might as well leave the states because it's a disaster no matter how good you're doing
 we're in north carolina
 it's great to be in idaho
 no you're in iowa
 nah he makes a lot of those mistakes they're a little scary
 we're going to protect your second amendment you understand that
 but did you see sleepy joe did you see sleepy joe where he said last year 150 million people were killed by guns in our country
 150 million
 that means 50 of our country
 that's a big story
 150
 can you imagine trump saying that
 these people would never let me live it down
 we can't make even a little mistake
 we can't make even a little tiny tiny mistake
 if we make a tiny mistake it's headlining
 they say things like 150 million people killed guns they say super thursday they say georgia he's looking forward to winning georgia tomorrow
 georgia's not in super tuesday
 so many mistakes
 you can't do that when you're negotiating with china
 can't do that when you're negotiating with these countries can you
 those mistakes would be very tremendous
 then you have mini mike
 you see this guy
 can you believe it
 mini mike
 he's being interviewed tonight on fox
 can you believe it
 fox
 they want to be politically correct
 they want to interview they end up interviewing more democrats than republic … i don't know what's going on with fox
 but they're interviewing this guy the night before … mini mike ay ay ay what a mess he is
 the worst debate performance in the history of presidential debate history
 the worst in history
 nah i got to have more
 i'd get down real low but i don't want to copy him
 everybody saw it
 everyone said oh they all say oh
 do that again where you get down low
 but if i do that again it's a copy
 it's a copy
 no no
 no
 you never like to copy even though you're copying yourself
 you don't like to copy
 you do it once
 it was a big hit
 but you do it once and you sort of say that was nice don't do it again because if it doesn't work the second time it gets embarrassing right
 right
 we all know
 but no he's a disaster waiting to happen
 he's a mess
 no matter which democrat candidate you're talking about and you understand that any one of these candidates … and you see what's happening right
 it's being rigged against … it's sad
 it's being rigged against crazy bernie
 crazy bernie is going to go crazy
 crazy
 i think crazy bernie is going to be more crazy when they see what they're doing
 i called it a long time ago
 mayor pete buttigieg buttigieg may pete he quit
 out last night
 then i hear a senator from a state we're going to win we're going to win that state but she dropped out
 sounds like they made a deal
 they both supported sleepy joe
 you know why
 they made a deal
 you know why
 quid pro quo that's why
 don't care
 quid pro quo
 quid pro quo they made a deal
 impeach them
 they should be impeached
 they should be impeached
 quid pro quo
 but they've embraced an extreme left wing agenda
 their plans would massively raise your taxes destroy our liberty muzzle our faith and erase our sovereignty
 you know that
 the democrat party has gone crazy
 whether it's bernie sanders plan to eliminate private healthcare elizabeth pocahontas's plan … by the way she's history
 she's history
 i came up with that name far too early i should've just waited
 but it didn't matter
 i thought she was making a come back
 i said wow i just did it to her
 but you know those embers were burning a little bit a couple of months ago
 they never caught on
 in fact she'll probably lose the state of massachusetts to bernie
 so she doesn't know what to do because you're not supposed to lose the state of massachusetts if you get in there
 she's the senator
 she's the senator for massachusetts i think she's going to lose it to bernie
 and miss michigan you see what's going on over there
 michigan we're leading
 we're leading in wisconsin
 we're leading in florida
 we're leading in the last election
 hey how great was the 2016 election
 one of the greatest nights one of the most highest rated television nights in the history of television
 and remember there was oh this is going to be a quick one
 this is going to be… oh that wasn't so easy for them
 i love the scene
 the scene of that convention center where hillary was getting ready to speak and then she found out she lost
 but elizabeth warren's here to plan to eliminate our borders or mini mike's plan to eliminate your second amendment
 mike bloomberg wants to eliminate your second amendment
 don't worry about it it's not going to happen
 not going to happen for him
 for sleepy joe he doesn't even know where he is what he's doing or what office he's running for
 actually i honestly don't think he knows what office he's running for
 and it doesn't matter
 maybe he gets in because he's a little more moderate
 so maybe he gets in
 but he's not going to be running it
 other people are going to
 they're going to put him into a home and other people are going to be running the country
 but they're going to be super left radical crazies
 they're going to be super left radical crazies joe's going to be in a home
 he'll be watching television
 everything will be just fine
 the insanity of washington democrats is why millions of registered democrat voters are joining our movement
 they are joining our great republican party
 we have the enthusiasm in our party
 no i really mean it
 i constantly hear about the enthusiasm
 they're fighting each other they hate each other they don't know what's going on
 we have all the love we have all the enthusiasm and we know what we're doing
 we know what we're doing
 so we're thrilled to be joined tonight by many really great terrific brilliant wonderful warriors
 even though he comes from a slightly different state but not to far by is somebody that really has distinguished himself he's become a great friend of mine
 what he did for justice kavanaugh do you remember that
 one of the greatest statements ever made in the united state's senate senator lindsey graham
 come on up lindsey
 lindsey graham come on up lindsey
 come here lindsey
 i got to have him say something come here lindsey great guy
 they handle pressure so well
 they came and we gave a rally that was like this and dan bishop and gregg murphy won by so much it wasn't even close
 they're great people and they've done a fantastic job
 thank you very much
 they handle pressure
 they were under a lot of pressure they handled it well
 it's nice to know people can handle pressure there aren't too many of them
 north carolina republican party chairman michael whatley

 i have a few great friends of mine and they love north carolina
 louis dejoy who you know louis dejoy
 two great people diamond and silk
 right
 diamond and silk

 you know the first lady a long time ago now right
 how long is that
 probably almost almost five years ago she said there are these two women on the internet they're unbelievable
 they're unbelievable
 i said oh i know i hear that all the time
 i hear it all the time
 she said the next day she came again
 she said i saw them again they're unbelievable
 i said let me see
 i saw them i fell in love with it and everybody fell in love with diamond and silk
 so thank you
 some people that have really been helpful to me corey lewandowski david bussey and pam bondi right here
 thanks also to all of the people who are working to make the 2020 republican national convention right here in charlotte an outstanding success rnc chairman ronna mcdaniel rnc co chairman tommy hicks and convention president marcia lee kelly thank you all
 you're doing a great job i'll tell you they're looking they're going to spend a lot of money and doing a good job
 should we doing a great job but just an okay job
 it doesn't matter as long as you win
 you know what i gave when we won last time somebody else took them to convention center spent a fortune and i just took a hotel ballroom
 i said what the heck if i win nobody cares if i don't
 look if you win nobody cares what room you're in
 if you lose nobody cares what room you're in
 so we took a ballroom nice ballroom that's it no big deal
 i think it this way if we win nobody cares
 and if we lose i'm out of there i save a hell of a lot of money
 every place that we've gone it's been amazing
 i'd also like to recognize so important a woman who's really helped us win north carolina in 2016 i have a feeling this year she'll even do better because she happened to grow up here lara trump and my son eric trump
 two great people
 i mean i have to say that about my son but i know a lot of people don't like their sons that much but lara has been fantastic and thank you very much what a job
 she knows this state better than anybody in this room except maybe this guy right here
 how are we doing lara
 how are we doing
 how are we doing in the state are we doing good
 and we're doing well in pennsylvania i hear and south carolina i know we're doing great there
 also with us tonight is a man who's really become a good friend of mine
 we were going at it a little bit at the beginning but i will tell you and i would say if i didn't get along i would not be here
 i wouldn't do this
 i think he's been tremendous
 he's been a tremendous supporter and things that we've wanted to do and fights that we've had which were so important he's been right up and lizzie will tell you that he's been right up in front and really he deserves another six year term
 probably a lot longer than that but he's going to come up and i'm going to ask senator thom tillis come on up
 thom has really been incredible he's been working everyday
 and he really wants to fight to the radical left and he does it and he knows how to fight and take care of our amazing veterans and stop illegal immigration
 thom is the champion for the people of north carolina
 this november we need everybody to go and vote for thom he's doing great
 he's doing great
 i hear he's way up in the polls he's way up in the polls
 thom say a few words
 get me off this stage
 get me off
 you guys didn't tell me this was going to happen
 no that was great thom
 we're also honored to be joined tonight by a true american hero a veteran of world war ii and the korean war who just turned 100 years old
 his name is george washington perry legit
 george thank you very much for being here
 thank you george
 100 years
 he's 100 and he looks good
 thank you george
 with the help of everyone here tonight america has now become the hottest economy anywhere on the planet earth
 since my election over 219000 new jobs have been created right here in north carolina
 we have lifted 10000000 people off of welfare including 7000000 people off of food stamps
 median household income has reached the highest level ever recorded think of that
 the average unemployment rate from my administration is the lowest for any us president in recorded history that's happening that's happening
 the unemployment rate among african americans hispanic americans and asian americans has reached the lowest level in recorded history
 very important to me african american youth unemployment has reached an all time low
 african american poverty is that the lowest rate ever recorded
 for decades democratic politicians betrayed and they truly did they betrayed african americans
 my administration is delivering for african americans like never before
 no president has done more for our black community no president has done more for our black community and it's an honor to do it
 last month here in charlotte we launched a nationwide campaign to create a better future for all americans
 it's called opportunity now you know about it
 we're also fighting to ensure that working families have access to paid family leave reducing the cost of childcare and giving 40000000 american families an average of 2200 thanks to the republican child tax credit
 the republicans are claiming that we did that nobody else did but the democrats are saying how did they do that one

 the usmca is a giant for north carolina's incredible farmers and factory workers
 and by the way speaking of farms factory workers and small businesses are all for the death tax
 you know about the death tax right
 it's called the inheritance tax
 you have a small farm some place you have a small business you have a nice business you no longer have an inheritance tax or a death tax
 so if you want to leave it to your children you can leave it to your children there's no tax to be paid by your children
 so they don't have to go back to the evil banker borrow money from the banker lose the farm lose the business it won't happen
 and i always say i know a lot of parents that don't love the children very much
 is there anybody in this room that does not love your children
 please raise your hand
 please raise your hand
 nobody
 nobody that's because we're north carolina you love your children
 but if you don't then it doesn't matter because if you don't love your children don't leave them a damn thing but you don't have the inheritance tax anymore which is great
 a lot of people don't even know that but that's a big deal or no issue have washington democrats more thoroughly betraying the american people than on the issue of immigration sanctuary cities which release dangerous criminals to terrorize your communities
 right here in north carolina believe it or not the sanctuary county of durham released an illegal alien criminal who then receded to viciously murdered a young 19 year old woman last year you know all about it
 killing her and dumping her body into the woods
 last year alone sanctuary jurisdictions in north carolina how did that happen to north carolina
 deliberately set free hundreds and hundreds of and these are really dangerous criminal aliens including those charged or convicted of burglary gun crime sexual assault kidnapping and even suffering they inflict on our people
 we're building the wall
 we're building the wall
 we're building the wall
 we're building the wall
 mexico's paying for the wall by the way
 we built 127 miles as of today 127
 mexico is paying for the wall
 the media is going to be thrilled when i explain that mexico is paying for the wall because you know now finally they said i've had obstruction like you wouldn't believe
 the entire democratic party
 i could get anything
 i created space force
 i could do anything
 i could get
 lindsey and thom tillis knows
 mark knows this
 all of them knows this
 if i wanted 25 cents for the wall they didn't want to get it
 they didn't want to do it but now we got it and you think that's easy
 nobody else could have done this
 we're building it
 we're building our hearts away
 we'll soon be building many many miles a week but we're up to over 125 i guess 127 28 by now of the super duper wall super duper
 i went to border patrol i said  what is your wish
 well sir we'd like it to be steel and concrete
 they want it exactly what they have it and the barriers up top they want everything
 it's called a no climb provisor no climb provisor
 i said what does the word provisor mean
 they didn't know
 all it means is you're not able to climb over it
 it is very tough
 i don't know if you saw
 in a part of the wall a couple of weeks ago they were climbing the wall and the fire department had to come and take them down
 that's what the no climb is
 that's what the no climb is
 it's a no climb
 it's more money
 it's a little more expensive
 thank you
 who is that
 what a voice
 pavarotti
 so we're building the wall
 it's going great
 so they said all right
 he's building the wall but mexico's not paying for it
 yes they are
 you'll see
 you'll see
 you understand
 some of you understand because i told a few people last week it got linked to the fake news media
 if you want to end sanctuary cities in north carolina and across america then you have only one choice
 you must vote republican
 you have to
 you have to
 we've added catch and release one of the worst loopholes you've ever seen catch and release
 you catch them
 you then say where do you live
 they don't know because look let's face it they don't know
 i understand that
 it's not even to be laughed at
 they don't know
 where do you live
 i don't know
 mexico maybe honduras guatemala who knows
 el salvador
 where do you live
 like this guy he's a mexican
 you're about as mexican as i am
 look at this guy
 he's as mexican as i am
 look at that hat
 are you mexican
 are you mexican
 no you're not
 are you
 he is
 it's like elizabeth warren
 she said she was an indian
 i said i have more indian blood in me than you have and i have none
 she said oh this is terrible
 so she went out and got a test and it turned out not so good for her
 right
 1024th right
 one thousandths so i was right
 i probably have more in me
 what a phony she is
 what a phony
 washington democrats have never been more extreme
 132 congressional democrats have signed up for bernie sanders' healthcare takeover
 while the washington democrats are trying to destroy your healthcare and your social security and they are going to destroy your social security
 remember they used to say with me i'm going to end it the first day
 well you know what we're going to soon be four years and all i've done is make it stronger
 you know that
 my administration is protecting your social security your medicare and is fighting to give you great healthcare
 you're going to have great health
 we are defending your right to keep the doctor and to keep the plan of your choice
 remember president obama
 you can keep your doctor
 you can keep your plan
 28 times
 they said impeach him
 you should impeach him
 28 times he lied
 28 times on record you can keep your doctor you can keep your plan
 well that's not true
 it wasn't
 impeach him
 we're making healthcare better and much cheaper while premiums more than doubled in the last five years before i took office
 we are now offering plans that are up to 60 less expensive and they're better plans
 we are protecting people with preexisting conditions and we always will and we are trying terminate in the supreme court of the united states the worst healthcare in the world and we are going to give you the best healthcare you've ever seen at a low price and again protecting preexisting conditions
 protecting preexisting conditions
 we're fighting to stop surprise medical billing
 you know what that is
 surprise
 you get all sorts of surprises
 we have people that take a blood test in one place it's 26 and in another place it's 2000
 same blood test maybe the cheap one is better who knows
 same blood test
 it's wrong
 surprise medical building
 bombed
 out
 billing
 i signed an executive order opposing price transparency that's going to be bigger than healthcare because when providers are required to show their prices those same prices fall very very fast
 right
 it's a big thing
 it's a big thing
 we've approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs which are just as good as name brand drugs but a fraction of the cost
 we have given them and there's a lot of political pressure not to do that you can understand why
 to care for our amazing veterans we passed va choice and va accountability and nobody said it could be done
 so now instead of waiting in line for days and days and weeks and weeks to see a doctor you go outside you get a doctor we pay the bill you get all fixed up
 what a great thing
 it's called va choice
 i got it done
 they've been trying to pass it for almost 50 years and they haven't been able to
 those people over there were a great help
 we have passed the spectacular right to try
 you know what that is
 hopefully nobody in the room needs
 hopefully nobody in the room needs right to try
 we are combating the opioid epidemic
 drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 31 years
 we've launched new initiatives combating kidney disease and alzheimer's and we're pursuing new advances in neonatal research to care for america's youngest patients and breaking all records in so doing
 virtually every democratic candidate has declared their unlimited support for extreme late term abortion ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up until the very moment of birth
 how about that
 that is why i've asked congress to prohibit late term abortion of babies because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift of god
 then you have the governor of virginia
 the baby is born
 the baby is born and he says and then you go over and start talking to the mother as to whether or not you execute the baby
 this is the governor of virginia
 the governor of virginia
 he's a beauty
 you remember what he did
 he wanted to dance like michael jackson and his wife stopped him
 he got lucky
 but the governor of virginia wanted to do that
 the baby is born and then he goes over and talks to the mother
 the doctor will now talk and you'll make a decision as to whether or not the baby lives
 did you ever hear of anything like this
 the democratic party is the party of high taxes high crime unlimited regulations open borders late term abortion socialism blatant corruption and the total obliteration of your second amendment
 the republican party is the party of the american worker the american family the american dream and the late great abraham lincoln
 so many people came up to me tonight and they want me to fight and we're doing it for school choice so that every child who needs it gets it
 no parent should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school
 i passed criminal justice reform to give former prisoners a second chance at life
 alice johnson do we love alice johnson
 this could not have been done by anyone other than the republican party
 i recognized israel's true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem
 we recognized israeli sovereignty over the golan heights
 our historic investments in the united states military include 200 million to a place that nobody's heard of in this audience i'm sure fort bragg
 300 million for marine corps air station cherry point
 more than 500 million for marine corps air station new river
 listen to this one
 no democrat's going to this
 they don't even want to spend money on the military
 they don't like the military
 they're not going to spend money
 1
2 billion for camp lejeune
 1
2 billion
 do you think that a guy like sleepy joe's going to put he doesn't know what it means
 i know what i means
 we have to have a strong military
 we have the strongest military we've ever had
 when i came in our military was in sad shape
 it was depleted but we've rebuilt it 2
5 trillion dollars went into our military
 01 is the actual survival of an our nation itself
