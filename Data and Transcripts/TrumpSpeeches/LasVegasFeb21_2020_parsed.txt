 just like they were in iowa
 they're not going to be able to count their vote
 they're going to tell you about healthcare
 they're going to tell you about our military and the jet fighters and the missiles and rockets but they can't count votes
 they just can't count them
 they can't count votes but they're saying they may not be able to do it again
 they're still trying to tell us

 with your help this november we're going to defeat the radical socialist democrats and we are going to win nevada in a big beautiful landslide
 now we have some special people here you know the special very special people
 and we celebrate one of the greatest moments in the history of sports
 some people say it was the single greatest moment in the history of sports
 it was called the miracle on ice
 do you remember that
 that was when the russians had a team assembled
 that was probably they say maybe the greatest team ever assembled
 they were unbelievable
 and our guys played a practice game with them was it a couple of weeks before and i hate to tell you the score was 10 to 3 and the usa was not on top and this team was an incredible team and they went in and it was amazing but tomorrow marks the 40 years since the united states men's hockey team defeated then soviet union team in the 1980 olympics
 incredible
 that was incredible
 most of you remember that
 i'm looking
 we've got a lot of young ones but we've got a lot of people that remember that

 unless i'm still president then which is a distinct possibility i won't be here and you know what they'll do
 i'll say how's the olympics going
 does anybody have a ticket for the president that got the olympics to come here
 they'll say i want to thank and they'll thank hundreds of people but they won't thank you president that i'm the one that pulled it off
 but that's okay
 2028 olympics is coming to los angeles
 it's going to be great
 and we worked with the mayor of los angeles
 he was great
 he called up and we gave him a lot of help
 i was president elect then because the president didn't want to get involved
 he didn't want to get involved in getting the olympics so they called me and i was president elect hadn't taken office
 then i got involved and i'll tell you they were happy we got involved
 it was great
 it's going to be very exciting today
 we are thrilled to have with us 14 players of that really incredible gold medal team
 give him a big hand
 and they were amazed
 they said boy is a big crowd
 i said it's only because you guys are coming
 this day was supposed to be for this evening
 and i said let me get back to washington do it early
 so we gave you almost no notice
 you have thousands of people outside thousands of people inside
 you had to see we were in iowa we were in new hampshire
 you saw what happened in colorado last
 that was unbelievable
 every place we go it's the same
 it's been incredible
 i don't know if you saw the pictures last night of the outside in colorado

 so i hated to do it to you at 12 o'clock but i said let's go
 i want to get back
 we got to deal with china
 we got to deal with russia
 we got to deal with north korea south korea

 bill baker
 bill come up
 bill baker
 dave christian ken morrow jack o'callahan mike ramsey
 those legs took a beating
 mark wells neil brotton john harrington rob mcclanahan buzz schneider dave silk phil verchota and a great coach and assistant coach at the time craig patrick
 they said four more years 12 more years left for them
 look at that
 look at the press
 hey mike look at the fake news back there
 it's a lot
 i always say that's like the academy awards used to be
 this year we had a movie they said best movie they announced the movie from south korea
 i said what's that all about
 the movie was made in south korea
 look i get along great with south korea but you know i never saw that one before
 they used to go best foreign movie but now we do it that way
 i don't get it but that's what it used to be and this is really an incredible time
 i'll tell you what for our country that's why i like to see things that we do get honored because nobody is doing what we do
 nobody can do it like us
 we're the greatest country in the world again
 we have the greatest people
 we have the greatest military by far
 we've totally rebuilt our military
 jobs are booming incomes are surging poverty is plummeting
 factories are returning confidence is soaring like these guys the confidence is soaring but you know we do have somebody that i'd like to point out because this team is they had a coach and that coach was a very inspirational coach would you say mike
 and i'd like to have maybe one of you come up and just say a few words about coach brooks because he was very very he was really a big he was a big heart on this team
 please
 say something
 so tell me one thing one thing
 so i see those tears
 that means you think you miss him and you love him
 right
 was he actually a nice guy
 because he looked tough
 mike was just saying he was brutal but he was a good guy right
 tough but great
 thank you very much
 thanks kelly
 thank you all
 greatest sports story could be number one
 so a lot of people a lot of these sports experts sports writers have voted that as the single greatest sporting event or athletic achievement
 i think so yeah
 they put it number one certainly top five
 in the history of our country we have a lot of things that we've done to break records
 we're going to go over them but we've broken a lot of records now but i want to thank that great team for being with us
 very inspirational
 this is a big day
 the anniversary
 thank you fellas
 thank you
 in my state of the union address i proudly declare that we are in the midst of the great american comeback and we're just getting started
 after three years of ridiculous witch hunts and partisan democrat crusades
 by the way i think they're starting another one
 did you see that
 i see these phoneys
 these are the do nothing democrats
 they said today that putin wants to be sure that trump gets elected
 here we go again
 here we go again
 did you see it
 a story
 aren't people bored
 now does that include because a couple of weeks ago crooked hillary said chelsea gabbard right
 tulsi gabbard and right
 she was a russian agent
 tulsi and also stein from jill stein
 i don't know jill stein
 i never met the woman
 she is a green party candidate or was they said she's an agent of russia
 i don't know her and i don't know tulsi
 the only thing i know about both of them is they're not agent
 they are not agents of russia
 these people are sick
 that's pencil neck pencil neck again
 little pencil
 no i just see it again
 i was told that was happening
 i was told a week ago
 they said they're trying to start a rumor
 it's disinformation
 that's the only thing they're good at
 they're not good at anything else
 they get nothing done
 do nothing democrats
 that putin wants to make sure get elected
 listen to this
 so doesn't he want to see who the democrat's going to be
 wouldn't you rather have let's say bernie
 wouldn't he rather that bernie who honeymooned in moscow
 wouldn't that be
 these people are crazy
 that's all they think about
 they don't think about the country
 they don't think about jobs
 they don't think about lowering your drug costs
 infrastructure
 these people are crazy
 trust me i like what we're doing and i love this country
 i love this country
 now and i campaigned on it at the same time we want to get along with russia we want to get along with china we want to get along with all these countries
 who the hell needs to have conflict
 but these people are sick they are sick people
 the radical left's attempts to poison our democracy and overturn the last election have totally ended in a big fat failure
 and by the way you saw today single best day i've ever had is the polls and any poll that the fake news gives you because the real numbers are higher but any poll they give you as a fake
 but wisconsin the great state of wisconsin i was leading by many many many points against every one of these characters
 can you believe it
 we got a new one
 mini mike
 how did he do in the debate the other day
 mini mike
 here's a box mike
 here mike
 mini mike
 he was a beauty
 what happened huh
 he couldn't breathe
 what happened
 mike would like to know how about that pocahontas screaming at him
 she forgot
 she forgot that she lied about her own heritage
 she said she was an indian because she had high cheekbones
 that was the only thing
 remember what i said i have more indian blood in me than she has and i have none
 right
 i have none
 to the best of my knowledge wouldn't mind having some but i happen to have none
 and she choked and she went out and got a report done
 one 1 thousandth and 24 you know what that means
 that means probably i do have more
 now why did he bring that up when she was screaming at him
 why
 because he was gasping for breath
 i can't breathe
 i can't breathe
 she's hitting me too hard
 pocahontas
 well she won that debate cause mike could not respond
 that's what they all said
 they all said that
 that's funny
 i won they're all shouting
 it's not me that's saying it
 fake news
 you fake news people
 no they all said it though
 who won the debate
 trump
 you know what
 the way i look at it when fake news cnn oops there goes the camera off
 red light just went off
 see i can tell every one of them
 i know them by heart
 i know the operators
 i know the camera men
 they're okay
 they're all on our side by the way
 they're screamed at
 get that camera off
 i don't want to do that
 get that camera off or it's going to be you job
 all right i'm sorry
 precedent
 but how bout msdnc
 they're worse than cnn
 and they're owned by people that really are bad
 i think they're very bad for our country
 the owners of comcast rotten company bad for our country very bad
 they try they have all these pr things to try and keep their image nice and clean
 what they do on television is so disgusting
 i think in the old days you had to have licenses for this stuff right
 they can say whatever they want to say
 let's see what happens over the next period of time
 bunch of dishonest people
 comcast terrible company
 terrible people running that company
 and you know what i had celebrity apprentice i had the apprentice on for 14 seasons 14 seasons and they used to come to my office and they would kiss my ass
 please sign
 please
 please sign
 it's an interesting story
 they came and we signed you know who signed me jeff zucker
 it's one of the only things he's done good in broadcasting but i signed and nbc as you know is owned by comcast but i signed and they figured the show would be a total failure
 so they only signed me for one season
 you know i was going to have it
 it was go on and then the show goes started at ten went to eight went to seven went to five went to four went to two
 it went to one
 i had the number one show in all of television
 number one
 it was a phenomenal and the final episode remember that
 with the you remember that
 do you remember the final
 we had i don't know it was one of the biggest shows of the year
 it was a tremendous success there
 but here i was i signed with nbc and they didn't even want to waste the ink on an option
 usually they have an option for not you know just like they didn't do it
 you stupid people
 so they paid me very little for the first season i think 25000 a show which is considered not good
 that's okay
 it was fun
 i didn't know it was going to be success you know
 hey just like this was successful
 it's a recent
 because when i left and arnold schwarzenegger and i like arnold said some very nice things so i'm not but the show did not exactly succeed when i left but i had it on and they wanted me to sign for more and i said no i'm going to run for president but i'll never forget
 i looked at i didn't know anything about this business and i had an agent wonderful guy from william morris and he said sir i don't want you to sign
 no business show has ever done well on network television
 well it's not business it's entertainment celebrity
 sir i don't want you to sign
 sir don't sign
 i said yeah okay
 but i have a problem
 i shook the hand of somebody i have to
 and mark burnett was great
 he was my guy and but we shook hands
 so i have to but i agreed you know i didn't know that no business or no business type show had ever succeeded on a network television
 so he said i don't want you to sign sir break it
 i said i can't break it
 can't break it
 anyway so the show i said started at ten went to nine went to became it was the number one show all of a sudden and the agent called me up and he said sir i remember it was six in the morning
 i was in bed
 he said sir the show just went to number one
 i'd love to see you because i think i'm entitled to more money
 i said you didn't want me to do the show
 well not really
 i mean i was okay
 he said i'd really like more money
 i said jim i like you very much jim you're fired
 get out
 anyway i had 14 great seasons over about 11 years because it was so successful they kept… they would have run it
 remember when they did the three hours the whole night was the apprentice
 i said wait a minute
 gone with the wind to mention the movie a second time gone with the wind is shorter
 they had the apprentice on for three hours
 i said even i think it's too long
 you can't put it up for three
 you got leave a little bit like i want to come back next week
 but they had it on for three weeks
 we did fantastically with it
 comcast did great
 nbc did great
 they wanted me to sign for another three years
 i said no i'm going to for president
 and that was actually the time when i knew i was going to run
 because you know how they were paying a lot of money and whether you're rich or not it's still a lot of money
 i don't care how rich you are
 it's a lot
 millions and millions of dollars
 and i said no i'm going to run for president
 and i did that
 but from the day i ran they went from being you know one… but from the day i ran they went from being wonderful they were nice
 they were nice
 i guess if i didn't do well with the show they wouldn't have been nice because they weren't nice to other people that failed
 people that didn't have good ratings that business is a very simple business
 if you have good ratings you can treat them like garbage
 if you have bad ratings you can say sir i really respect you so much
 get out of here
 get him out of my yard
 they're very ruthless people
 but comcast is a rotten company
 they forgot totally
 and they are worse than cnn
 i will tell you that right now
 comcast is worse than cnn
 we should call it comcast because that's their beautiful maiden name comcast
 they're worse than cnn
 i'll tell you something about cnn
 jake tapper today he put out… now i know you don't like him
 i know
 who likes him
 who the hell can like him
 i think his wife likes him
 actually
 i really believe she does
 but let me just tell you he put out a couple of social media posts today because i never call it tweet i call it social media because it's much bigger than tweet
 what we have dan scavino
 the great dan scavino
 we have won five sites
 we're number one on twitter we're number one on facebook and the whole world
 the whole world
 so it's powerful
 but jake tapper put out some things basically saying i believe it that's the way i read it that the new russian thing that started yesterday that putin wants to be sure that trump which give me a break
 give me a break
 but jake tapper said it ain't so and if he did say that because they were a little complex they can turn them around or when zucker sees him and said why did you put that
 i want that deleted and i want you to do a different one
 but he did say that
 so i respect that because it's another hoax story
 but we're standing up for the defense of our constitution for our freedom and democracy itself
 you know that
 i got to get that
 hey bobby
 bobby
 see that guy
 i love that shirt
 bobby i don't know
 he looks like a nice guy
 can you please walk him up even if you have about five
 come here come here
 come here
 come here
 you got to see this shirt
 you got to see this shirt
 i love it
 i've got to order me one that i can ride around
 come on
 come on up here
 he looks safe
 he doesn't look like he's going to start a fist fight
 he's a good fan i guess
 you got to see this shirt
 i love it
 is there any place that's more fun than a trump rally
 right
 how many rallies have you been to
 80
 80
 80
 he said 80 rallies
 come up here
 come on
 come on
 come on
 look at these two guys
 these guys are serious
 these are serious fans right
 are you with him
 are you with him
 are you with him
 you're with him
 come on
 come up here
 man
 and look at this guy come on
 thank you fellas
 wow
 i just said how long have you two been together
 i figured they'd say we're married
 he met her at the rally in colorado
 can you believe this
 can you believe it
 man did he get lucky
 they both got lucky right
 they both got lucky
 well that's cool
 no i just see there's so much stuff out here
 it's genius actually
 while the extreme left has been wasting america's time with viral hoaxes we've been killing terrorists creating jobs raising wages enacting fair trade deals securing our border lifting up citizens of every race color religion and creed
 as you heard we added another 225000 new jobs last month alone
 way above anticipated schedule
 and that makes 7 million new jobs since the election
 the number was supposed to be under 2 million and we added 7 million
 and remember if i give you wrong numbers the fake news is going to have headlines
 trump gave you wrong… i mean it's very tough
 i've got to be very careful
 even if i give you wrong in the wrong way they'll say it was wrong
 i said yeah but it was wrong in the low way
 no that's no good either
 got to be very precise with these characters
 the democrats don't have to be but we have to be
 we've destroyed he isis territorial caliphate 100 we killed the founder and leader of isis
 al baghdadi is dead
 al baghdadi is dead
 17 years
 they looked for him
 17 years
 al-baghdadi
 one of the first things i did when i came in
 he's the founder of isis and when i came in three years ago isis was all over the place
 and i said you got to knock it out
 we knocked it out of syria and iraq and other places
 we really knocked at 100
 remember i wanted to leave
 i said all right
 we were at 96 then 98 then 99
 i said let some of these other countries do it
 wouldn't you say right
 so what happened is i wanted to leave and they said no no no we want 100
 so we wait and stayed
 we got 100 then we moved them all out of syria except we did keep the oil
 you noticed that right
 we kept the oil
 sorry
 they said he left soldiers in syria
 yeah i did to keep the oil if you don't mind
 which is what we should have done in iraq too by the way
 i would have done that
 i'm making a lot of money with all that oil
 but you remember that whole thing that whole… i said you got to find al baghdadi
 i've been saying that actually for two years
 i had a lot of other things to do the first year like fight off the democrats
 these crazy democrats with their hoaxes
 think of it
 if they use their genius because they are genius at that stuff right
 they're really good
 they can take nothing
 they can take a perfect phone call made to the ukrainian president who said very specifically there was no pressure
 he doesn't even know what's going on and they can take this perfect call
 thank goodness i had a transcriber
 do you agree with it
 because the fake whistleblower said that the call was totally different than what the call was
 so when i released the call when i released the transcripts they died
 they said oh we got a problem
 they never thought i was going to do it but i had no choice
 i had to because i had to show they're liars
 but think of it they can take something like that a perfect phone call or they'll take just out of thin air they can make something up
 and they ended up today front page new york times
 they used to call it the eighth column
 that's the big column on the right
 i don't know
 the papers become so small
 i don't know if they have an eighth column anymore
 they used to have the eighth column was a big deal right
 that was the big deal
 today it's too narrow
 think they're probably… after i'm gone they won't have any columns
 that's why eventually they're going to support me
 eventually the times and the washington post which will be dead as a doornail after i leave and the cnn it'll be an obsolete business the cable business
 msdnc will be out of business
 you know cable was supposed to be obsolete and now they're doing the highest numbers they've ever done
 if an airplane goes down with 700 people they don't cover it
 if it's not trump related they don't cover it
 it's got to be trump or trump related
 so if a plane goes down and it's total devastation if the ship goes down if the titanic- if the titanic equivalent went down they wouldn't cover it unless i was on the sucker
 it's true
 they wouldn't cover it
 the fake news would not cover the equivalent of the titanic
 but you know what they're going to do before the election
 they're going to say we want to just say something
 we're going to endorse the president
 you know why
 because they'll be out of business
 can you imagine if they had to cover mini mike
 who i don't think i think he's gone but you know what
 he'll spend another 500 million
 don't forget i spent 70 and i won of my money
 in other words they said and this was in the new york times i said the other night in colorado
 i spent 70 mini mike so far has spent almost 500 million dollars in order to get embarrassed by pocahontas
 pocahontas
 and she's mean isn't she
 did you see that
 do you see the anger on her face
 that nervous energy
 she's jumping up and down
 she's a mess
 but no no she's mean
 right
 right
 that face is just… you want to get him
 she said i got him
 i want to see those agreements
 i you open up those agreements
 this poor guy probably signed a hundred of them and each one's a disaster
 he said i don't want to open those agreements
 nobody told me this was going to happen
 said actually sir
 nobody told me
 get me out of here
 after the debate he went backstage fired a lot of people
 he said how the hell did you get me into this thing
 but pocahontas was really mean but she's going to be easy
 i hope it's her
 it's not going to be her
 can't be i don't think
 alfred e
 neuman ladies and gentlemen introducing president alfred e
 neuman
 nobody knows because you're all too young
 nobody knows who alfred… it's mad magazine
 they all said… no
 howdy doody
 see nobody knows who alfred e
 neuman is
 only the real aficionados
 they're the ones and they love it
 but that's only 15 of the crowd right
 am i right
 better than howdy doody
 howdy doody
 and that's what happens when you can't get the words out
 no it does
 that's what happens right
 when you can't get the words out you get angry
 you get angry because you can't get the words
 that might happen to me someday
 can you imagine if that happened to me
 man would i be a bad guy
 i'd be the meanest man in history
 no but biden is very angry
 he gets angrier and angrier and angrier
 he's changed
 and then you have the tom
 yeah
 he said tom steyer
 tom said  mister impeachment
 how did that work out tom
 thank you very much for the great poll numbers between him and nervous dancing
 how did that work out
 this schmuck spends 250 million dollars he ends up with one third of a percent in iowa
 but maybe that could be rick because they still don't have any idea what he got
 maybe he won iowa they took it away from him
 no but he was substantially below it
 all i know it said 1 and an arrow left
 so he spends 250 million tom steyer
 never heard of this guy
 who is he
 where did he get his money
 who is he
 he was in the coal business did you know that
 this guy this phony is a big environmentalist
 he made his money a lot of it in the coal business
 nobody knows that but he's a fake
 remember when he walked up to bernie the other day
 hi bernie
 hi
 oh and he was having a fight with pocahontas right
 is this the greatest
 mark burnett said this is the greatest reality show in history
 he said you can take the apprentice and you can take survivor and you can take every other reality show ever made multiply it times 10000 and you still don't have what we have
 and even the cas
 he did say this
 you got the perfect president
 you got the perfect first lady
 how about the first lady
 you got the perfect kids
 the kids though
 those beautiful kids
 my beautiful kids
 they had such a great life before i did this
 sorry kids
 sorry
 my beautiful ivanka
 she had such a great life
 she had a company that was selling shoes and everything you could sell
 she'd just put her name on it and she said daddy does it matter
 i want to come to washington and help people get jobs
 right
 ain't that true
 and she left the company
 and when you leave a company all of a sudden it doesn't do as well
 i wouldn't say that i exactly helped talking about the wall and other things but she left the company came to washington and she said 500000 jobs
 that was her goal
 and she did that in the first month
 she actually did
 she's gotten these great companies like walmart and many others exxon she's gotten them to take millions of people
 she's now over 15 million jobs where they train people and bring them into the companies
 it's incredible
 15 million
 and she's smart
 she got it figured out but most people can't but she does
 but all they do is give them heat
 they work so hard
 and could you imagine you take biden's son
 can you imagine
 but you know what
 we don't do any of that stuff
 we don't do that stuff
 we don't do it
 the kid got 3 million dollars 83000 a month and he didn't have a job until his father became vice president
 and speaking of vice presidents and speaking also of reality television because it's the greatest show of all time right
 look at us
 look
 we told you what last night
 little change here folks
 we're going to move it up from eight o'clock in the evening until 12 o'clock in the afternoon
 little change
 just a minor change
 because i have to get back to washington to work
 i feel guilty
 this is too much fun
 but speaking to vice presidents and speaking of perfect vice presidents if you become president the first thing you have to do is choose a really horrible horrible vice president
 so if the idiots ever want to impeach you they have to say i can't impeach him
 look who we have
 i have the perfect vice president
 i have the greatest in the world
 i have the greatest vice president
 i don't know
 i got the great ones
 i said i can't do that
 i picked a great guy
 he's done a fantastic job
 he's been a great vice president
 but it is true
 i could have picked i'll give you names but don't want to do that because i don't want to hurt anyone's feelings
 but there are plenty of them out there
 they're mostly out there and i don't want to do that
 but mike pence has been great
 but tell me is it perfect casting the whole thing
 and this isn't about casting this is about real life
 but when mark burnett said to me the other day he said the greatest reality show of all times times of million
 that's exactly except for one thing we work our asses off and we are doing things like nobody has ever done before
 right
 right
 so we took out al baghdadi and then we just took out two weeks ago the world's top terrorist qasem soleimani of iran ending his evil reign of terror forever
 he's the father of the roadside bomb
 when you see our beautiful people walking around with no legs they're walking and trying to walk so hard and they're really in rough shape he's the father of the… he loved the roadside bomb
 he thought it was a great thing
 where is he now
 soleimani
 and i'll tell you what you know who's happy about it
 the people of iran are happy and even the leaders of iran because the leaders of iran were afraid of him
 okay
 and the fact is america is respected again
 we're winning
 we're winning all over
 we're winning in washington that democrats keep losing their minds
 that is why millions of registered democrat voters are leaving their party to join our movement
 look we're a unified party
 the republican party has never been unified like it is today
 i'll show you
 i could say we're going to go over to the hill
 no we're going to go over to someplace and we're going to do a rally at eight o'clock tonight
 we'd have tens of thousands of people there
 there's never been this
 ronald reagan was great
 i thought he was a great guy great president didn't like his policy on trade
 that's okay
 trade
 but if he came to las vegas you know they'd have a ballroom and they'd have 500 maybe a thousand people
 what we're doing… and this isn't even i must say this i don't want to tell you this this is not election season
 because we're nine months away
 election season is when you're two months away
 we're not even in election season and we have more enthusiasm now
 believe it or not then we had even before the election in 2016
 it's true
 it's too early
 it's too early
 it's true
 we have a great gentleman and a woman with us a friend of mine mister and misses sheldon adelson right over here
 great great person
 two great people
 he's got so much money he doesn't know what the hell to do with it
 he owns the sands hotel
 that's like one of the smaller businesses
 sheldon that's like your small business right
 he is a great guy
 she's an incredible she's a doctor and she studies addiction and drugs drug addiction all sorts of addictions
 and she knows more about that subject i think than anybody and she works hard and she doesn't need it
 he does not need the money that she brings in
 okay
 he also happens on the paper
 he owns the paper
 you own the paper in town right
 they wanted like a couple of hundred million dollars too much
 you said give it to them
 it's peanuts
 what the hell difference does it make
 we want to thank the adelsons
 they've been incredible fans and they love israel
 they love israel
 i just saw him sitting there
 i didn't know they were here
 i just see him sitting there
 he's something
 the chairman of the nevada republican party who's really been great
 he's been with me for a long time and he's a very committed man
 make america great again
 oh oh oh
 let's do a poll quick
 just quick
 i'll never get rid of maga because i'm superstitious
 but we just hit an all time high with the stock market
 our military is rebuilt
 you just got the greatest tax cuts in history the greatest rate regulation cuts and all this stuff
 so let me ask you this
 so make america great again it sort of doesn't work quite as well
 so now we have keep america great and we have the new hat
 it's higher stiff
 it's like a billboard right
 i call it the billboard
 it's a billboard
 so let's go just that
 because i am very surprised by it
 we're going to keep them both but i just curious if we did go to one make america great again
  keep america great
 i can't
 i would have said that's impossible
 make america great again is the greatest phrase
 a lot of people again fake news i think will agree to it
 it's the greatest phrase ever used in politics
 it's the greatest phrase
 now who has the greatest phrase ever used in the history of politics and say oh let's go with a new phrase
 right
 but we're going to keep it
 so we have to keep maga
 but now we have cag now we have cag
 so we have a both
 i just don't have the courage to get rid of the one
 it would be too disrespectful
 too disrespectful
 but michael mcdonald i want to thank you and the members of the nevada republican central committee
 you're all here
 they're great people
 and the man came here
 he loves us
 he's been with us
 rick harrison of the world famous gold and silver pawn shop
 rick harrison
 you better win michael
 otherwise that's the last time i'm introducing you like that
 i hear we're up
 i hear we're doing nicely
 i hear we're doing great
 and by the way the union i have a lot of respect for that union
 last time i had a strike in my building during the election
 it's the only reason we would have won this state
 brilliantly to save three cents
 i could have settled the strike before the election
 i wanted to save 2 total
 and he wasn't too good
 he didn't do too good
 but we almost won this state despite… i had a big strike
 had thousands and thousands of union guys
 they had it look they wanted wanted to show us
 but i think that the unions are really with us and the unions have been with us
 they're teamsters so many of the unions
 because i'm for the working man and woman whether you're union or non-union
 some states are all union some states are no union
 but we get them all
 and i think we're going to have tremendous success
 and a lot of the democrats are going to ruin the healthcare programs that these unions have
 the unions have worked hard on healthcare and they're going to ruin them
 they're going to take away… well we're going to… you can lose 180 million people off of great private healthcare
 so we'll see what happens
 but a lot of the democrats want to do that
 they think it's wonderful
 but together we're building the world's most prosperous economy and the most inclusive society
 that's true
 since my election over 125- that's true
 since my election over 125000 new jobs have been created right here in nevada including over 40000 new nevada manufacturing and construction jobs
 a 30 increase
 the national unemployment rate is the lowest in over half a century and soon we're going to have that be a historic number like so many of the others
 the average unemployment rate for my administration this is the coolest of them all is the lowest for any united states president in recorded history
 that's pretty good
 when i'm in a debate they're saying we're going to do this
 i say listen we have the best unemployment numbers in the history of our country
 african american unemployment hispanic american
 hispanic we got a lot of hispanic
 i love hispanic
 who in this audience is hispanic
 yeah we're doing great
 well we should be doing great
 you have the lowest unemployment rates ever recorded
 asian americans likewise the lowest ever recorded
 the unemployment rate for women reached the lowest rate in 71 years
 african american youth unemployment has reached an all time historic low
 people i love people i might've helped more than anybody because of choice and accountability
 the veteran's unemployment rate drop to the lowest record
 lowest in history
 the unemployment rate for disabled americans has reached an all time historic low and you got to remember they're back there checking every word
 they're going oh my god
 he's right
 i can't say it because i got all these maniacs back there
 they're trying to find… he put the comma in the wrong place
 he didn't make that word plural therefore he lied
 now i've got to be very accurate because all these numbers they check them out
 they're in there checking them out
 check on the african american unemployment please
 please tell me it's not historic
 these people are among the most dishonest human beings on earth
 not all of them
 workers without a high school diploma
 we have millions of people that didn't go through high school
 they left
 they had problems good problems bad problems families where they don't have the money
 they didn't get a high school diploma
 they've achieved the lowest unemployment rate ever recorded in the history of the united states
 those are important groups of people
 half a million more hispanic americans now own a home
 now hispanic have done so good
 and by the way you know who understands the border because we are building that wall like crazy
 remember they also said if you build the wall you'll lose the hispanic vote
 i said i got to do what's right
 you know who understands the border better than anybody
 you know who understands crime at the border better than anybody
 the hispanics understand it and they don't want to be working and have people come and take their job
 have people come in where they can't pay for their house have people come in who are very bad people
 you have some very bad people
 you have murderers and rapists and we have set all sorts of records at the border but we're up to 122 miles of wall and it is true
 the people that understand it the best are hispanic
 so thank you
 we got to make our country safe
 we've lifted 10 million people off of welfare
 median household income is now the highest ever recorded in our country
 think of that
 i say it all the time
 president bush eight years 450
 president barack hussein obama eight years  975
 president donald john trump three years
 it's actually less when they did the numbers
 three years including the big tax cuts that we got you and the regulation cuts
 three years
 so you had 450 975 that's eight and eight
 now we're down to three years a little less three years  10000 per family a year
 10000 a year
 our historic regulatory reduction campaign is restoring american liberty and ending the tyranny of federal bureaucrats
 i deal with them
 they're not good
 it's called the swamp
 we've ended the war on american energy lowering utility bills reducing prices at the pump reducing your prices
 part of that number is all of the money that we save at the pump and on electric
 i also recently took action on an issue nevada has been dealing with for over 30 years
 yucca mountain
 you know yucca mountain
 my budget stops funding for the licensing of waste storage at yucca mountain so that we can focus on positive solutions and for much better reasons and alternatives
 why should you have nuclear waste in your backyard
 i won't say which countries but you know what other countries do
 i will not say which ones
 they put it on a ship
 they float it out into the middle of the ocean
 they find a nice deep spot and they dump it
 that's the end of it
 but we would never do that for environmental reasons
 we are reversing decades so yucca mountain… you're okay please
 okay
 just relax
 sheldon do you have somebody at your newspaper back there who can write
 yucca mountain please
 he'll call up yucca mountain is okay
 that's the end of that
 so yucca mountain you're in great shape
 maybe they can finally report it properly but we're reversing decades of calamitous trade policies
 for years washington politicians took money from lobbyists global corporations and corrupt special interest to ship our jobs and factories and all of this stuff and all of this wealth
 they stole our wealth
 they shipped it overseas and to other countries
 america lost one in four manufacturing jobs following the twin disasters of nafta and china's entrance into the wto the world trade organization
 probably an even worse deal for us than nafta if that's possible but under my administration the great betrayal of america is over
 america is no longer for sale
 last month we ended the nafta catastrophe and i signed the brand new u
s
 mexico canada agreement usmca
 see we played the song ymca because that's the only way you'll remember
 just think of the song ymca
 think of the song and you'll remember that usmca is a gigantic victory for farmers ranchers and manufacturers all across the great state of nevada
 i also took the strongest ever action to confront china's massive theft of america jobs
 our strategy worked
 last month we signed a ground breaking trade agreement
 probably the biggest agreement of any kind ever signed with china that will defend our workers protect our intellectual property and boost american exports by a lot
 china will be buying 250 billion worth of goods from us now and 50 billion from our farmers
 my guys wanted 16 i said make it 50
 my guys wanted 16 they got china up to 20
 i said nope
 got to make it 50 and then i said to china you got a billion and a half people
 what difference does it make
 they said you're right
 50 billion i don't think our farmers can produce that much but we're going to soon find out
 they're going to buy very large tractors
 after years of building up other countries we are finally rebuilding our country
 we are finally putting america first
 or no issue of washington democrats more thoroughly sold out the american people than the issue of immigration
 before i came into office the far left's policy of open borders allowed deadly drugs to flow freely into our country poisoning our children including right here in a very big way
 the great state of nevada
 washington democrats put the needs of illegal immigrants before the wellbeing of american citizens
 you know that you've been complaining about it for a long time
 it's one of the reasons you voted for trump
 they want to let anyone from around the world simply walk across the border and then they want to give them a lifetime of free welfare of healthcare of lots of other things including education
 all paid for by the taxpayers of the united states
 illegal immigration costs nevada taxpayers think of it more than 1
6 billion every year over 1500 per household
 for the amount of money washington democrats want to spend supporting illegal immigrants we could rebuild every city all of these distressed areas in the united states throughout our country
 the money spend it's not even thinkable and don't forget when we say come like in california the clown he says come we'll give you free healthcare
 people that weren't even thinking about coming
 that's why we have caravans of people that we're turning back
 mexico's been great
 by the way they gave us 27000 soldiers on our border
 but when a governor nice guy actually he's a nice guy
 we just got to explain the facts of life
 he's a nice guy
 oh doctor please
 doctor in the house please
 medical please
 a doctor
 thank you
 take your time
 we've got plenty of time
 yeah take your time please
 a lot of these people have been here for three days
 it's a lot
 those front row people are tough
 take your time doc
 thank you everybody
 thank you doctor
 that's true
 they get here so… they stand and sit and sometimes days early
 in colorado they're there three four days early
 it's tough
 and we work it and make sure that you have everything you want
 number one we cover the facts and number two we want to have a good time because we have to have a good time
 but things like that happen a lot because after two three days it's not easy and these are strong people
 i'm not going to fight any of them okay
 now amazing people
 thank you very much
 under my administration we're finally taking care of our own citizens first including millions of illegal immigrants who follow our laws pay their taxes lift up our society and are entitled to a government that protects their families and protects their communities
 every day democrats' open border policies are harming and killing innocent people
 you know what's happening you know what's going on
 in this region alone last year ice officers and they're patriots
 they're strong tough patriots
 if we didn't have them
 they remove thousands and thousands of ms13 gang members a year and plenty of others
 who else is going to do it
 ice officers arrested over 5 000 criminal aliens charged or convicted of dangerous offenses including robbery rape and even murder
 many murders
 in western nevada an illegal alien was charged with robbing and brutally executing four victims last year
 right here in las vegas three ms13 gang members abducted a man tied him up with his shoelaces shot him repeatedly and hacked him to death with a machete
 you know exactly what i'm talking about
 it's right here in your place in las vegas right here
 tied up and hacked him to death
 yet left wing politicians oppose all detention of illegal aliens even convicted criminals and murderers and they support deadly sanctuary cities
 i say this all the time and i just… how the hell where are they coming from
 i don't get it right
 seriously i don't get it
 sanctuary cities imperil american lives by releasing dangerous criminal aliens directly into your communities
 if you want to shut down sanctuary cities if you want to protect your family and your loved ones you must vote republican in 2020
 and you have some great ones here michael
 thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border we have reduced illegal border crossings eight straight months in a row
 and as the wall gets longer it gets easier and easier
 remember when the democrats were saying you don't need a wall
 two things that never change right
 all these computers they said use drones
 oh great we'll fly over with drones
 watch the people pour in by the thousands
 that's great
 use drones
 before i came along they all wanted a wall
 they just didn't know how to build it
 they had no clue
 they had the money they actually gave the money back but they had no clue
 but as soon as i came in and i said wall they went against and i made a terrible mistake
 we catch them
 you know the story
 they come over could be a killer murderer rapist
 they come over
 we can't do anything
 we have to be politically correct
 we catch them
 we then say what's your address
 they don't know
 they don't even know their country in many cases
 where do you come from
 we don't know and they mean it but some are very serious criminals
 so we catch them we take whatever they can take which is nothing and then we had to release them in our country
 we can't bring them back
 and then we have a system of judges thousands of judges all over the place
 you got to be like perry mason and every illegal that comes in they have the lawyers
 the lawyers meet them they get paid fees but we're breaking the system
 no more catch and release you think that was easy
 and the big thing is that 30 foot… and this wall is built exactly to the specifications of border patrol
 totally
 and border patrol has seized the largest amount just recently of deadly narcotics ever recorded
 the largest amount
 we've deported record numbers of gang members
 we've done more to secure the border than any administration in history
 we are as i said building the wall faster than ever
 faster and bigger than anyone thought possible
 they can't believe we're getting it done
 we'll have over 500 miles of wall built sometime next year
 500 miles
 washington democrats have never been more extreme than they are right now
 132 congressional democrats have now signed up for bernie sanders takeover of healthcare that would strip 180 million americans many of them in this room of their private coverage
 remember president obama
 remember he said you can keep your doctor you can keep your plan
 28 times he lied so we should impeach him
 we're going to impeach him
 we'll do a belated impeachment
 28 times you can keep your doctor right
 remember you could keep your doctor
 unfortunately when they found out you can't keep your doctor he said i was just kidding
 now we should impeach him
 we'll do a belated impeachment
 fake news you have it
 see you have to be very careful when you say impeachment because you know what they do
 they go back and they write
 president trump said that obama should be impeached but he's not in office and so therefore they can't impeach
 he doesn't know what he's talking about because he's not in office so therefore they can't
 so you have to be very careful
 that's why i use the word belated impeachment
 belated meaning i'm just kidding okay
 they do it all the time
 they had it the other day
 i said bring back gone with the wind right
 i said a little bit up here but i said the movie the other day in colorado i guess
 i said huh south korean movie won
 they said ladies and gentlemen the winner of the academy award is … a movie made in south korea what's this all about
 and i deal with them they like me
 we're helping them a lot
 they're killing us on trade
 they beat us on trade and then they win the academy award for a fricking movie
 but we redid that trade deal but the other day they got me on this one too
 i said whatever happened to gone with the wind that beautiful movie
 vivian lee clark gable right
 whatever happened bring back gone with the wind
 and some of them wrote he doesn't know that that movie was made in 1936
 he says fake news
 it is fake news they're fakers
 but now anybody sitting there reading this saying man trump can't be that smart
 he said bring back gone with the wind
 that's an old movie
 yeah it's an old classic
 what i say is make great movies not this computerized garbage
 and i was never a fan of brad pitt i will tell you that
 no i thought he was a stiff
 he was a stiff it's like a boring guy
 all of a sudden he wins the academy award so fitting
 their ratings aren't so good at the academy awards
 you know when that stopped
 when they started attacking us their ratings went right down the tubers
 i told somebody the evening newscasts they're terrible for conservative people and they're crooked they're absolutely dishonest
 i said to one of the big broadcasters i'm friendly with him
 i said if you ever did a conservative newscasts instead of… you got abc is terrible
 nbc is just absolutely atrocious
 and they do badly
 not a lot of people are watching
 they used to when we had the late great walter cronkite and these legends right
 but abc is terrible and nbc is terrible and cbs is terrible
 they're all the same
 and i said your ratings stink
 if you would do a newscast that's conservative i'd get them a host
 i could recommend guys right now right
 i'd get them a host
 we'll call up… don't take sean hannity away from us
 don't take our show
 that's my problem i don't want to take away any of our people
 you get a pete hegseth
 you get a jesse waters
 you get… i could name so many of them right
 and you put them on that broadcast their ratings would go up five fold but they don't know that
 i don't know
 they're stupid
 their ratings would go through the roof but they would rather have a failed broadcast that nobody watches than put on a conservative person and lift the ratings five times
 they would rather have a fail… seven months ago we had a little skit and they were hoping the market would crash because they would rather lose their money or big parts of it and have a really horrible market on the basis that we not me we could not be elected on november 3rd
 this is how crazy- … on november 3rd
 this is how evil this is how crazy they are
 they've gone crazy
 i guess you call it trump derangement syndrome
 but if they ever did a conservative broadcast meaning very fair very honest when i say that it's almost like do a fair broadcast
 just a fair broadcast
 that thing would be the hottest show
 but they don't realize it
 and if they do they probably wouldn't do it anyway because they don't want to go away from what they're doing which is crazy because it is they're doing very poorly
 while the social and socialist democrats are trying to destroy american healthcare and your social security they're putting it at risk my administration is protecting your social security
 remember they said four years ago in the debates and you had this crazy woman
 i mean i hate to mention her name
 i did it you know yesterday
 i threw all the runs hates it
 she's a zero
 it's got zero television personality
 aero ab stoddard whoever that is
 she said donald trump lost all of his debates
 i won every debate and maybe i don't know maybe one somebody but i won with tremendous numbers
 he says you always won
 i'm not sure
 we try i'll tell you that and we're winning now
 but this crazy woman who's got zero going zero
 she said donald trump lost his debates that he won
 you know she was talking about how badly benny mike did
 so she said well donald trump
 no i won every single debate
 i won them against crooked hillary
 i won them in the primaries like 15 or 16 debates
 and for some reason you know sometimes you do say it's not a big deal
 nobody watches it
 nobody cares
 nobody even knows who she is
 i just made her famous right
 she's nothing
 she's nothing
 she's got no talent got nothing
 she's probably got a little drive
 that's how she keeps getting on television
 other people don't have her drive
 but you know what
 i said that's really unfair
 so i took out the polls time magazine drudge good guy drudge drudge
 we took out a lot of different things and we put up the drudge poll the time magazine and many others
 and some of them had to be down to like at 91 and they didn't have many people and i can't really show up because many of those people are now great friends of mine
 some of them are great republican senators
 i'm not going to show results but i'm holding it up just quickly glancing
 i call it a glancing blow but we won the debates and i have this fake news person saying donald trump did very poorly in the debates
 i want every debate easily
 i never did it before
 remember my first question
 i said rosie o'donnell
 that was one of my best answers
 rosie o'donnell who violated the campaign finance laws as badly as anybody i've ever seen and nothing happens to her
 right
 and yet ‘jevich violate … he made a little mistake and they want to destroy him
 so we pardoned him
 we pardoned him
 by the way he made a mistake
 rosie o'donnell
 that was a massive violation of the campaign finance laws but dinesh dinesh they wanted to put him in jail
 i don't know
 i think he might've even gone to jail for a period of time for doing something that was really very understandable
 rosie o'donnell
 five times what she did is incredible
 nothing happens
 and then she gets on and says what a bad guy i am
 i'm not a bad guy but it's really a disgrace
 you know it's a disgrace
 i'm glad they didn't do anything with it frankly because you know what to do for something like that
 but you know what
 we have two sets of justices in this country
 it's no good
 it's no good
 it's no good
 you know the thing we're working on right now
 we're trying to get fairness for a certain person who's been treated very unfairly
 a man who had a juror who was a radical anti-trump person and she didn't say that when she went up there and she became the foreperson of the jury and she did terrible things and said terrible things
 and you know how they caught her
 when he was convicted and then a statement was made she started jumping up and down screaming  yes yes
 and started telling everybody
 they said wait a minute
 wasn't she just a juror
 the woman was totally biased
 how do you do this
 so i fight
 look i fight
 a lot of times it's not worth it but i got to fight for fairness
 i got to fight for fairness
 got to fight for fairness
 it's a very unfair system
 i guess it's called the swamp
 when i said drain the swamp it was a nice phrase
 i never liked the phrase
 when i was campaigning somehow the phrase came up sir i think we have a phrase drain the swamp
 i said i don't like it
 that's too hokey
 but one day i was in a big arena 25000 people packed before the election and i said and we will drain the swamp
 the place went crazy
 i said wow you never know
 you never know
 frank sinatra said his best song
 i won't tell you which one because i'll ruin it for you but his best song is the song that he thought would never make it the song that he liked the least but he said that's the one that was the most successful that the people like you never know
 so i said drain the swamp
 and the people went crazy
 i said woah
 i said let's try that again
 and the next time i did it again and again and again
 i only didn't know how disgusting and dirty the swamp is and a lot of the media is a big part of the swamp
 so my administration is protecting your social security your medicare and is fighting to give you great healthcare
 we're defending your right to keep your doctor and your plan
 we're defending that right
 you're going to have that right back
 we're going to cancel that obamacare if we could win the case and we're going to give you great healthcare and we're making healthcare better and much cheaper while premiums more than doubled in the last five years before i took office
 we're managing it very well
 we got rid of the individual mandate by far the most unpopular thing where you had to pay a lot of money for the privilege of not having to pay for bad healthcare right
 we got rid of it
 and it was upheld in the supreme court what we did
 whenever we get sued everything we do if we move if we take 10 steps right or left we get sued and we're now offering plans that are up to 60 less expensive
 we're going to make healthcare a big part of this campaign
 we're protecting people with preexisting conditions and we always will
 that's why if we are successful you don't want the supreme court to try and get rid of this the caucus
 it's a caucus known as obamacare but we're running it much better than they did
 remember when they had this was the greatest the 5 billion website right
 5 billion
 it was supposed to cost 5 million
 i have a son at home
 he's 13
 he's a genius with computers
 hi dad
 what's up
 dead dad
 get out of here
 hey listen
 i'm the president of the united states pal
 don't talk to your dad
 dad come on dad
 can't you see i'm playing with my computer
 the guy talks to me and he's working with his computer
 these guys are genius
 you know they grow up with like walking right
 but he's looking at me
 i could have given him their healthcare site
 he would have done it for nothing and it would have been better than what they have
 so remember come on dad
 i'm busy dad
 what do you want
 what do you want dad
 barron woah
 wow he's going to like that
 he's a good boy
 he's a tall boy
 i'll tell you that
 just turned 13
 he's up there
 i'm saying hi barron
 how are you doing
 but they're great with the computers
 they spent 5 billion
 okay
 it was going to cost 50
 it was going to cost five
 it was going to cost 50
 then it was going to 

 what was the final number
 five hundreds
 the number that they spent 5 billion
 right
 it still doesn't work
 they spent 5 billion
 right
 and they spent 500 million on all of the problems it caused and we've really straightened it out but it's still lousy healthcare obamacare
 and it's really not obamacare anymore because when you get rid of the individual mandate it's no longer obamacare but we're going to terminate it
 we're going to give you your preexisting a hundred per- otherwise i won't do it
 we're going to give you brand new preexisting and we're going to have a great healthcare that's much less expensive
 and we're fighting to stop surprise medical bill and barron's is going to be very happy
 i signed an executive order imposing price transparency because when providers are required to show their prices those same prices fall very fast
 you know a man that does this very professionally is great into the healthcare business and you have to be careful when you say it but you know it was just a very strong statement
 but he said sir price transparency in hospitals
 where you can bid it out and you can look at the prices
 right now you can't see
 if you go to a hospital they won't even tell you how much it's going to cost
 they operate and then they'll give you a bill and you'll say oh my god i had no idea it could be
 they take blood
 we have one person blood 39
 another place the exact same thing 2500
 take blood a blood test
 one is 39 one is 2500
 the same test
 maybe the 39 test is better
 who the hell knows
 but it's crazy
 price transparency and he looks at me
 he goes and he's a real pro
 one of the top in the country
 he said sir and nobody wanted to do it because it's a little bit controversial and a lot of the drug companies don't exactly love it
 the hospitals don't love it but i got to do what's right for you
 the people i don't care i'm not
 i got to do it
 but he looked at me
 and this is why i did it
 it was one phrase
 you know do you ever do where you're not going to do something
 and then somebody hits you with a perfect phrase
 he said sir price transparency is bigger than healthcare
 i said what do you mean by that
 he said you will see numbers that far outweigh healthcare hospitals doctors
 he said you'll be able to price out everything
 you'll be able to see costs
 he said price transparency
 you know people you've heard about this for 15 20 years
 no president has the guts to do it
 probably means i won't get campaign contributions from certain people but i'm not going to get them anyway
 what the hell difference does that make
 i don't want them
 i don't want them
 i got to do what's right
 you know we're here for a short period of time
 even if it's a long period it's still a short period and we've got to do so
 price transparency is a big deal
 he said it's bigger than healthcare
 think of that
 bigger than healthcare
 so let's see what happens
 but that'll kick in
 unfortunately that kicks in after the election because we're going through the final stages
 we going through a statutory process unfortunately
 so think of it we're going to win
 but let's say the fake news could give me enough phony stories enough bad stuff that we don't make it
 the new president will get all the credit for price transparency and he won't even know what the hell it is
 and i took the heat
 isn't that something
 but we're going to win
 we got to win for that reason alone
 we've approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs which are just as good as the name brand drugs but a fraction of the cost
 and that was another one
 tremendous political pressure
 think of it
 you own bayer aspirin
 you own all these name name brand drugs that are making so much money
 and then the guy comes along said i want to make 20 forms of aspirin
 they're exactly the same
 exactly
 but they don't have a big name on it
 exactly as good
 i don't say better
 i don't say worse
 they're exactly the same
 you know people still they want to go out and buy the name
 you know
 i do
 i do
 you know
 because it's just because we're stupid
 no it's true
 they're exactly the same
 we're approving so many of the generic drugs a record number
 nobody's ever approved so much
 the drug companies hate it
 they hate it
 never happened like what we're doing
 we also took down the trial periods from 12 years down to five or six years
 they'd have a new drug
 the thing was obsolete by the time it got approved
 we've passed a really spectacular thing that they've been trying to get for 40 some odd years
 right to try
 so you don't have to now go if you get hopefully nobody in this room has those kind of problems
 right to try
 and so now you go and you sign a waiver and you get everything
 it's great
 if you're terminally ill
 if you're very very sick you're not going to make it
 and you know why they didn't do it
 they wouldn't approve it because they didn't want to be sued
 and they said no this could be dangerous
 they said the people are terminally ill they're going to die
 let them use the experimental drugs
 don't wait because they have another four or five years before they can come onto the market
 and it turned out we are having such unbelievable results
 and you know what else
 some of those drug companies are now like it
 that they fought me like crazy because it's really showing if it works there it's really showing that it works
 it's pretty amazing
 right to try and this is really something brand new initiatives combating kidney disease and combating alzheimer's disease
 we've made a lot of progress
 we've made a lot of progress sheldon and we're pursuing new advances in the neonatal research to care for america's youngest patients our babies and breaking all records in so doing
 all of the radical democrats in the presidential debates have declared their unlimited support for extreme late term abortion ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up until the very moment of birth

 good
 it's a different kind of address
 you know we can go lots of different ways right
 presidential not presidential

 if i didn't see the results i wouldn't like it at all
