 in my campaign for president i promised all of that
 if we were elected india would have a true and great friend in the white house and i can tell you you have never had a better friend as president that president donald trump
 that i can tell you
 the prime minister knows that
 on this day i'm happy to report that the relationship between the united states and india is stronger than ever before
 the ties between our two nations are grounded in our common values and our shared commitment to democracy
 we are free nations with great faith and a fierce devotion to our national independence
 we are governed by the rule of law guided by commitment to justice and strengthened by our love of liberty
 our two national constitutions both begin with the same three beautiful words we the people
 that means that in america amd india alike we honor respect trust empower and fight for the citizens we proudly serve
 under prime minister modi's leadership the world is witnessing a strong sovereign and thriving republic of india
 in a single decade with the help of prime minister modi's pro-growth reforms india has lifted nearly 300 million people out of poverty and that is an incredible number
 incredible
 that's incredible
 in the next decade 140 million indian households will rise to the middle class
 in both india and the united states we're seeing something really remarkable
 our people are prospering like never before because we are slashing bureaucracy and cutting job killing red tape
 in the united states thanks to our massive tax cuts and all of our great senators and congressmen and women that are here today and pro worker policies our economy is breaking one record after another
 since my election we have created over 6 million new jobs
 we have created over 750000 jobs right here in texas and very importantly that includes 70000 new texas manufacturing jobs
 they said that couldn't be done
 unemployment â€¦ think of this
 unemployment in texas is currently at the lowest rate ever recorded in the history of our country and unemployment in the united states has just reached the lowest level in over 51 years and very soon we think that will be broken to be a historic number
 unemployment among african americans asian americans and hispanic americans have all reached their lowest levels in the history of our country
 over the last two years the unemployment rate among indian americans dropped by nearly 33 and one third percent
 wages are rising incomes are soaring and inequality is falling at the fastest rate in many many years
 in the past 12 months alone the average worker has taken home 1000 extra in rising wages and over 3000 with tax cuts and all of the other things that we've done
 and for the first time in history most new hires of prime working age are minorities and women
 first time that's ever happened
 through our pledge to america's workers we have secured commitments for nearly 14 million employment and training opportunities for american workers done through our great american companies
 we passed the biggest tax cuts and the biggest tax reforms in the history of our country
 we slashed a record number of job killing regulations giving the average american household more than 3000 every year and never in the history of our country no matter how long the presidency have regulations been cut to this extent
 everyday the indian american community is helping to strengthen our country and build our future
 indian americans are pioneering groundbreaking medicines to save countless lives
 they're developing revolutionary technology that is changing the world and they're founding new businesses that provide jobs to thousands of our fellow citizens
 prime minister modi i look forward to working with you to make our nations even more prosperous than ever before
 and that's what's happening
 the economic miracles taking place today are just beginning
 here in the united states there has never been a better time to hire invest grow and pursue your dreams
 indian companies employ tens of thousands of americans across a range of industries including american steel
 in 2018 india's jsw steel announced that it would invest up to 500 million to revitalize a shuttered steel plant in the great state of ohio
 and we welcome india's growing investments right here in the lone star state
 nations around the world are investing in the united states because they know we have the best economy and the best workers in the world
 they have never invested in our country like they are today
 and we want to thank everybody and india has never invested in the united states like it is doing today
 and i want to say it's reciprocal because we're doing the same thing in india
 on tuesday two japanese companies toyota and aisin announced a combined investment of almost 800 million which will create over 900 new jobs right here in texas
 at the same time we are working to expand american exports to india one of the world's fastest growing markets
 we are committed to ensuring the indian people have access to the finest goods in the world product stamped with a beautiful phrase made in the usa
 and very soon india will have access to another world class american product nba basketball
 wow sounds good
 that sounds good
 next week thousands of people will gather in mumbai to watch the first ever nba basketball game in india
 am i invited mr
 prime minister
 i may come
 be careful
 i may come
 when it comes to expanding our commercial relationship no issue is more important than energy security
 for the first time ever the united states is the number one producer of both oil and natural gas on planet earth and number one by far with much of it coming right here from the great state of texas
 that means more jobs higher wages and lower prices at the pump
 yesterday we were thrilled to hear about the indian company petronas pledge to purchase up to 5 million tons of lng per year from the united states which could lead to billions of dollars of lng exports to india in the coming years
 and we have plenty of it
 over the last year crude exports to india have grown by 400 and liquefied natural gas exports continue to soar at record numbers
 thank you
 these tremendous exports not only expand employment in america but they increase freedom and security for india
 to keep our nation safe the united states and india forging an even stronger security partnership
 us defense sales to india have also reached 18 billion over the past decade
 we make the greatest defense mechanisms and equipment anywhere in the world and india knows that well
 we're looking forward to concluding several new defense deals very soon
 there are a lot of them in the works
 here in america we're creating the united states space force and we're working closely with india to enhance space cooperation
 in november the united states and india will demonstrate a dramatic progress of our defense relationship holding the first ever tri-service military exercise between our nations
 it's called tiger triumph
 good name it's a good name
 very good name
 today we honor all of the brave american and indian military service members who work together to safeguard our freedom
 we stand proudly in defense of liberty and we are committed to protecting innocent civilians from the threat of radical islamic terrorism
 thank you
 both india and the united states also understand that to keep our communities safe we must protect our borders
 since taking office my administration has launched a far-reaching effort to improve screening and vetting of applications for entry
 we are working hard to ensure that those who would threaten our security are denied admission into our country and we are enhancing our vetting efforts like- â€¦ country and we are enhancing our vetting efforts like never before not even close
 we're doing it on a daily basis and we'll soon be setting records in every one of the aspects of border security
 border security is vital to the united states
 border security is vital to india
 we understand that
 we are further taking unprecedented action to finally secure our southern border and stop illegal immigration
 i want to thank the president of mexico who right now has 27000 soldiers on our southern border
 it's been incredible what's taken place in a short period of time
 illegal immigration is deeply unfair to millions of wonderful legal immigrants who work hard pay their taxes follow our rules and obey our laws
 yet there are those in washington who would raid your healthcare to â€¦ free benefits
 they want to fund free benefits to those who enter our country illegally
 we don't want to do that
 we don't want to do that
 because if we don't do it they won't come
 i will never allow politicians to take away your healthcare or give it to illegal immigrants
 my administration believes our first duty is to the highest loyalty of all
 we must always be for the american people whether it's african-american hispanic-american indian-american
 we are going to take care of our citizens first
 we are going to take care of our indian-american citizens before we take care of illegal immigrants that want to pour into our country
 we want to build a nation where every family immigrant and us-born can live in a safe community with access to great school work in a job you love and have the best chance to reach the american dream
 we love the american dream
 just in concluding i want to say that america has always been a nation of pioneers and patriots risk-takers and free thinkers and dedicated workers who have honed a trade mastered their field and teach their children to always give their very very best
 every day indian-americans help write the story of american greatness and everyone here today has a crucial part to play in building an even grander and greater american and indian future
 to help achieve that exciting vision we are strengthening our cherished bonds with the nation of india and we are proving the awesome power of democracy and unlimited potential of free people
 together we will continue to deepen the ties between our nations
 we will honor the faith of dignity of our citizens and we will achieve incredible advancements for our people for our children and for the world
 we will discover new cures and save millions of lives
 we will advance cutting-edge technologies and lift millions and millions of people out of poverty
 we will pioneer new frontiers in space working together raising the sights of humanity
 we will uphold our values defend our liberty and control our destiny
 the united states and india will make our nations stronger our people wealthier our dreamers bigger and our future brighter than ever before and it won't even be close
