 hello phoenix
 it's great being here in the great state of arizona with thousands of hardworking patriots who believe in god family and country
 thank you
 thank you
 and with your help this november we are going to defeat the radical socialist democrats and we are going to win arizona in a landslide
 it's all over tv that the folks here tonight have helped a great world war ii veteran into the arena
 i don't know if he knows it but he's right now the hottest celebrity in the world
 i don't know what's going on here
 he might even be hotter than trump right now i have to say
 did you see the scene
 no he's all over television
 even fake news cnn him on
 they say he's a legitimate great hero of world war ii
 erwin julian
 irvin thank you
 and i asked my son don to get a couple of hats and get some things and give them to erwin right now
 and i want to thank you
 really that's a great honor
 and thank you for the great job you've done
 an american patriot
 thank you very much
 thank you don
 how did don do tonight
 okay
 he's good
 good guy
 and he loves this country
 so this is truly an incredible time for america
 we have the best economy the most prosperous country that we've ever had and the most powerful military anywhere in the world by far
 do you remember the good time we had a week ago at the state of the union
 you remember that right
 and that was my honor
 but i proudly declared that we are in the midst of the great american comeback
 our country is stronger today than ever before
 and after three years of very unfair and ridiculous witch hunts and partisan democrat crusades… it was the radical left's pathetic attempts to nullify your ballots poison our democracy and overthrow our entire system of government
 but guess what
 they failed and our poll numbers are higher today than they've ever been before
 and we're standing up to the defense of our constitution our freedom and democracy itself
 we're doing something that's never been done in the history of our country
 this movement has never taken place
 nothing like it ever
 and the fake news can attest to it because if they thought i was saying the wrong thing it'd be out there immediately
 it'd be all over the place
 it'd be all over the place
 trump exaggerates
 that's terrible what he says
 there has never been a movement like this and it began very early
 it began in 2016 with that wonderful beautiful night
 you remember that right
 that beautiful night in november
 and we're going to have another beautiful night in november
 this time it's going to be november 3rd
 get ready november 3rd
 we're coming
 we're coming
 so we're having great polls
 you're seeing the polls except for some of the fake ones
 and if i was treated fairly… meaning if you were treated fairly by the fake news we'd be up 20 points higher in the polls
 there wouldn't even be a competitive election
 unfortunately it's probably going to be competitive
 but i actually think we're going to win by a lot just like we did last time
 but i really believe we'd be up 20 points
 i mean all they do is negative negative phony stuff
 russia russia russia
 the impeachment hoax
 that's a hoax
 but you know we had great support from the republican party in the house
 it was 197 to nothing
 and in the senate it was 52 and-a-half to a half
 you know what the half was
 a halfwit
 and while the extreme left has been wasting america's time with the hoaxes we've been killing terrorists creating jobs raising wages enacting fair trade deals securing our border and lifting up citizens of every race color religion and creed
 by the way they turned away 21000 people outside so feel very good
 feel very good
 we haven't had an empty seat
 you know what
 we haven't had… true
 we haven't had an empty seat and this is a tribute to all of us because this is a movement like nobody's ever seen
 but we haven't had an empty seat since your great… and this is a great first lady
 came down the escalator with me in trump tower a long time ago
 we haven't had an empty seat
 from our rural communities to our inner cities we're expanding the blessings of america to all of our citizens
 we added another 225000 new jobs last month alone
 you saw that the geniuses
 you saw that
 you saw that last month
 they were doing predictions on one of the shows
 what do you think
 well i think 60000
 what do you think
 i think 100000
 what do you think
 i think 84000
 these are the ones that tell you all about how to invest
 what do you think
 and then they came out 225000 the market goes up again
 225000
 225000
 so many manufacturing jobs
 so many that frankly we're never going to come back
 remember you need a magic wand right
 they came back
 and remember this we're paying interest
 the past administration didn't pay interest
 they pumped money in like it was candy
 and we didn't pump money in we took money out
 and not that i was happy about that because i disagree with it
 because frankly if we kept the old practice which frankly some people could dispute one way or the other we would have been up in my opinion another 10000 points in the dow
 and we've set 144 records on the stock market in three years 144 records
 144 records
 record stock market
 and you know what that means
 that your 401ks are up 60 70 80 90 100
 guys come up to me
 he said mr
 president i just want to thank you
 my wife used to look at me like i was a total loser sir
 every year we lost money for years and years
 she said what the hell is wrong with you henry
 and this year sir i'm up 92
 she loves to me again
 she thinks i'm a genius
 92 401k
 she thinks i'm a genius sir
 she loves me again
 shows what money can do right
 but that makes… and think of this
 seven million new jobs since we were elected we were elected
 and when i took over isis was all over the place
 and we immediately started
 we have destroyed 100 of the isis caliphate
 we have killed the founder and leader of isis al-baghdadi is dead
 and we just took out the world's top terrorist qasem soleimani ending his evil reign of terror forever
 and the fake news doesn't want to tell you that
 they don't want to tell you that
 they don't want to tell you
 in fact do you remember the dog
 great dog conan
 when we took out right
 we love conan
 conan's a tough dog
 but when we took out al-baghdadi conan… remember this
 conan got more publicity than president trump
 that's okay
 they were looking for al-baghdadi for 16 years
 we found him and we took him out
 we killed another one last week
 the head of al-qaeda
 he was gone dead
 and america is respected again respected like never before
 we're respected again
 we're no longer the laughingstock that gets taken advantage by every country including by the way our allies who in many cases take a bigger advantage than our enemies
 i will tell you that
 they take big advantage but not so much anymore
 we're winning
 we're winning like never before
 washington democrats keep on losing their minds
 they hate the fact that we're winning
 we're winning big
 we're winning winning winning
 and that is why millions of registered democrat voters are leaving their party to join our movement
 they're joining our great republican party in droves
 you see it all the time
 i just spoke to some of your leaders
 he said this is unbelievable what's happening
 this is unbelievable
 you know there have never been rallies like that
 sleepy joe biden the other day had 68 people
 and now they have a new member of the crew mini mike
 mini mike
 no boxes we call him no boxes
 and i hear he's getting pounded tonight
 you know he's in a debate
 i hear they're pounding him
 he spent 500 million so far and i think he has 15 points
 it just came out
 hey fake news how many points does he have right now 15
 they won't tell you the truth
 they won't tell you the truth
 msdnc msdnc is worse than cnn
 they're owned by a company called comcast
 you can have comcast a bunch of phonies
 but msdnc is worse than cnn and they're all pretty bad
 you know they just came out with a poll
 they just came out with a poll a little while ago
 mini mike was at 15 and crazy bernie was at 31
 that's a lot
 and mini mike just spent 500 million
 but the dnc is going to take it away from bernie again
 that's okay because we don't care who the hell it is
 we're going to win
 we're going to win
 we have to
 well let me tell you these crooked politicians they really took away three years from us
 because despite the fact and nobody disputes it that we've done more in three years with the tax cuts and regulation cuts and the military and the choice and everything we've done more than any administration in history
 we've done more
 but think of it think of it
 we did it with phony witch hunts
 we did it with the impeachment hoax over our head the whole time
 we did it under circumstances that should never ever happened to another president again
 true
 but with your energy and enthusiasm this november we're going to take back the house we're going to hold the senate and we are going to keep the white house
 so we're thrilled to be joined tonight by some of the best greatest
 i love them
 leaders in america arizona leaders

 i want to beat him
 will you please get out to the polls so we can beat him
 but he's tough to beat
 doug ducey say a couple of words please

 these are great people great people
 thank you very much
 so you know before i introduce somebody very important to all of us to me… also i have to say with us tonight is an arizona hockey great a friend of mine
 he's a great golfer too
 he's a tough golfer
 i'll tell you he's tough to beat
 he's tough as hell
 and if you beat him in golf he'll try and beat you physically
 he doesn't care
 he was the toughest hockey player
 he was one of these guys he could beat you one way and if he couldn't he just beat them up right
 he'd beat him up
 and he's a friend of mine
 he's a great guy jeremy roenik
 where's jeremy

 he's a winner
 we're also joined by donald jr
 and kimberly
 they're great people great
 and rnc co-chairman tommy hicks
 and rnc finance chairman also happens on a team called the chicago cubs i shouldn't tell you that… todd ricketts
 so finally it's my great honor to introduce a tremendous person a great fighter pilot
 a lot of people don't know that
 she's a great fighter pilot and a warrior senate
 she helped us so much during the impeachment hoax she didn't wobble one bit martha mcsally
 you know martha's tough on the border
 and she's working with me to strengthen our military still further and lower your prescription drug prices
 we're making a lot of progress
 but her opponent i have to say this martha a guy named mark kelly
 even the democrats don't like him much
 he wants to raise your taxes open your borders give away free healthcare to illegal immigrants and he wants to obliterate your second amendment
 he wants to get rid of it
 the radical liberal democrats from california and massachusetts they're pouring money into kelly's campaign because they know that he's a rubber stamp for crying chuck schumer crying chuck and nervous nancy wacko pelosi
 and we're going to have a new speaker
 but that's why martha has my complete and total support and endorsement and we have to all get out there and make sure that martha mcsally… she's a warrior
 let me tell you you don't know
 we don't know
 people don't know people
 this one is tough as hell and that's what we need
 martha mcsally
 thank you
 we'll be back
 thank you martha
 well she's right
 how about that congressman al green
 we can't beat him so we have to impeach him
 how about that
 that's not what our… as they call them the founders
 how many times did you hear the name the founders
 that's not what the founders had in mind
 but we're going to have a big big election victory
 we're working to- but we're going to have a big big election victory
 we're working together
 i don't think the republican party has ever been more unified than it is right now
 i really don't believe so
 so whatever you can do for martha we need her
 it's been so incredible
 thank you very much
 thank you for everything martha
 i appreciate it
 thank you
 together we're building the world's most prosperous economy and the most inclusive society anywhere
 we're inclusive
 this is the republican party
 we're inclusive
 right here in… right
 you know that
 right here in america right here in arizona we've created 240000 new jobs right here
 including over 60000 new manufacturing and construction jobs here
 nobody thought it was possible
 you've had the best year that you've ever had
 arizona you've had the best year the most successful year that you've ever had in the history of the country
 it's the best year you've ever had
 so i'm going to take all the credit away from your governor
 i don't care
 no we have a great team with doug and everybody else but you've had the greatest year
 you know that doug number one year in the history of your state
 it's an incredible achievement
 incredible achievement
 i don't know this has to be pretty good stuff on the debate stage
 we'll talk about well you had the best… in many states the best year they've ever had
 then they said let's get a new president
 i don't think that's going to work so easily
 the country's had the best year it's ever had
 let's get a new president
 let's put in crazy bernie
 let's go
 crazy bernie
 unemployment has reached its slowest rate in over 51 years half a century
 the average unemployment rate for my administration… think of this
 the average so we're talking about now more than three years is the lowest for any us president in recorded history
 the unemployment rate among african americans hispanic americans and asian americans has reached record lows lowest in history
 african american youth unemployment has reached an all time low in the history of our country
 african american and hispanic american poverty has plummeted to the lowest rate ever recorded
 the unemployment rate for women has reached the lowest level in 71 years
 soon to be historic
 and veterans' unemployment has dropped to a record low
 we're working with our veterans we're taking care of our veterans like nobody's ever taken care of our veterans
 the unemployment rate for disabled americans has reached the lowest level in history
 workers without a high school diploma you have a lot of them
 they left high school
 they said i should have finished
 they left
 they can't go back
 they left
 we've achieved the lowest unemployment rate without a diploma ever recorded in us history
 isn't that great
 they're great numbers
 hispanic americans right now more than 500000 own a home
 more than 500000 more own a home
 and we've lifted 10 million people off of the welfare rolls
 think of that
 10 million people have come off of the welfare rolls
 and happily
 not that we did anything
 they have jobs and they love them
 they're making much more money and they love getting up and going for work
 if they don't like that job they can get another one because people are starving to get great employees right now
 they're starving to get great employees
 since my election the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by 47 three times faster than the increase for the top 1
 median income
 think of this
 this is such a big deal
 median household income reached the highest level in the history of our country
 under president bush in eight years it went to 450 more
 under president barack hussein obama under a period of eight years it went to 975
 under president donald j
 trump… did you ever hear of him
 in only three years including regulation cuts and tax cuts… because the other ones raise taxes
 we cut taxes by the record amount
 it went to 10 000 per family
 a record
 a record
 that's why our consumer right now our people they're booming with cash
 that's one of the reasons our economy is doing so much better
 china had the worst year in the last 67 years
 asia's doing poorly
 europe is doing poorly
 the united states is doing great
 we're doing the best we've ever done
 the best we've ever done
 to lift up forgotten communities that need investment and these are really communities that need it the most we created opportunity zones
 we worked with tim scott the great senator from south carolina
 his idea
 he came in and saw me
 i said let's give it a shot
 nothing's worked over the years but this has really worked
 now jobs and investment are now pouring into 168 newly designated opportunity zones right here in arizona alone
 from apache to navajo and maricopa counties
 we're supporting working families by fighting pay
 we are doing a job with paid family leave
 we're doing something that nobody's ever done to this extent
 reducing the cost of childcare and giving 40 million american families an average of 2200 in their pocket thanks to the republican child tax credit
 our historic regulatory reduction campaign is restoring american liberty and cutting through job killing red tape like nobody has ever cut regulations before
 we've ended the war on american energy lowering utility bills reducing prices at the pump and eliminating our reliance on hostile foreign suppliers
 for the first time america is now energy independent
 such beautiful words
 energy independent
 we fought wars
 we did everything we could
 we used to take the straits and everybody else benefited
 we'd them clear so that other countries could take oil from the middle east with… that nobody paid us
 now they're starting to pay us a lot of money folks
 they took advantage of us
 but we have everything we need right now
 we have made such progress in the last three years with pipelines
 the keystone pipeline keystone xl
 i approved it
 the dakota access pipeline
 i approved it
 48000 jobs
 we're reversing decades of calamitous trade policies
 the worst trade deals any human being has ever seen
 i said who made these deals
 the worst stupidest deals i've ever seen
 they were good for other nations
 if you like other nations that's great
 but we're now putting america first
 it's very simple
 for years washington politicians took money from lobbyists global corporations and really the most corrupt special interests anybody's ever seen
 to ship our jobs and our factories to other countries
 we lost our taxes we lost our workers we lost our companies and we did nothing about it
 now we've done a lot about it because companies are pouring back in
 america lost one in four manufacturing jobs following the twin disasters of nafta the worst deal ever made worst trade deal ever made and one that was almost as bad and gave china an entrance into being a rocket ship when they entered the world trade wto
 one of the worst deals that we participated in this
 by the way we just won 7
5 billion in a lawsuit with wto
 we weren't winning anything
 we weren't winning anything but they said i think this guy's going to pull out
 they treated us so unfairly
 we were always in the minority position
 i mean who the hell negotiated these deals
 but they look at us and they say look if we're not treated fairly we're gone
 all of a sudden we're winning all these cases
 but we just won 7
5 billion
 7
5 billion
 did you know that doug
 7
5 billion
 but under this administration the great betrayal is over
 america's no longer for sale
 america is no longer for sale
 those days are over
 two generations of politicians came and went promising to replace nafta
 how many times have you heard we're going to replace nafta
 probably the number one reason i ran for office
 are we glad i ran for office
 i think so
 it's funny i was watching the different… i find it fascinating
 i'm watching the different returns coming in and i'm watching as much as i can of this stuff
 i love it
 we all love it
 if you don't love it you're not going to do it very well
 the crazy new york times which was a dead newspaper when i ran it was dead as a doornail
 a month before i ran doug i held up a new york times it was like what you get thrown in your face at a supermarket
 it was a thing
 it just flew away
 there was nothing
 now it's doing very well
 but you know what
 someday we won't be here
 when we're not those papers are in big trouble
 but this thing was a dead newspaper
 but i was watching and they had an article this weekend about people that spent their own money and how they're doing
 they have mini mike has spent 411 million
 it's a question mark how's he going to… i'll tell you how he's going to do
 he's probably not going to get the democratic nomination
 that's how he's going to do
 but mini mike 411
 then they had this idiot steyer
 we call him impeachment steyer
 how did that work out steyer
 he's another beauty
 the guy worked… he spent 210 million
 he got one-third of 1 in iowa
 in new hampshire he did much better
 he got less than 3
 guy's in there for like 250 million
 how did it work out steyer
 you jerk
 i never even heard of him
 i never even heard of him
 i turn on every time… for years i'm turning on… impeach him
 they don't even know why
 they never say why
 they don't have any reason
 impeach the president
 this guy spent a fortune on this stuff so it worked out pretty good
 but anyway so then i go and i look
 it has mini mike's… question marks
 i can give you the answer but right now they have to have a question mark right
 then they go down and they had other people
 some of them i like
 they have ross perot who honestly… it was a tough day for bush when he joined the campaign
 because clinton didn't win
 ross perot took away 19 of the votes
 didn't clinton get 41 or 43
 give me a break
 but that's okay
 whatever
 but they had ross perot spent like 100 million which is probably double if you bring it up to today's dollars
 then they have different people
 a friend of mine who ran steve forbes he ran twice
 he was in for a lot
 then they had donald trump
 now this is your own money
 this is your own money
 i said i'd spend a lot of money on my primaries
 we'll see how the hell we do
 it's amazing
 once you win money comes in
 it comes in pretty fast
 what's that all about
 but so in the middle they had trump and then they had four or five that were behind me
 lot of money spent
 loss loss loss loss loss
 but in the middle they have donald trump
 it didn't say 500 million and it didn't say 250 like this steyer guy
 it didn't say… it said 70 million of my own money
 i spent 70
 it said donald trump won the presidency of the united states
 right
 we won
 my father would teach me if you could spend less and win that's better than spending a lot and winning
 crooked hillary spent at least three times more than we did and lost
 crooked as hell
 she's crooked as hell
 we have a double-sided justice
 it's very unfair what's going on
 very unfair
 but let's see how it all works out folks
 let's see how it all works out
 i hope you're going to be happy
 i hope you're going to be happy because there are a lot of dishonest slimeballs out there
 dishonest scum
 dirty cops a lot of dirty cops
 by the way the fbi those guys in that are incredible
 but the ones on top they were absolute scum
 what they were trying to do if that happened to obama or a democrat or especially a liberal democrat they'd be in jail for 50 years and it would have taken place two years ago already
 they spied on our campaign
 remember that
 after they spied we won
 then after we won they tried to get us out of office
 it's never happened before in the history of our country and we can't let that happen
 we can never ever excuse it
 we can never let them get away with that
 never let them get away with it
 but we keep our promises that we work hard and our economy is great
 the last month we ended the nafta… look you saw it
 nafta catastrophe
 that's what it was
 we ended that catastrophe
 again i really ran because of nafta
 i said how stupid
 all over the place
 in your state but you go to new england empty factories empty buildings
 still you have empty buildings
 we lost so much
 we lost 60000 factories and plants
 i signed that brand new beautiful us-mexico-canada agreement into law
 the usmca is a gigantic victory for farmers and ranchers and manufacturers all across the great state of arizona
 by the way for people with the small farms and small businesses if you love your children you can now leave your companies you can leave your farm you can leave your ranch to your children and you don't have to to pay they don't pay a death tax
 they don't pay an inheritance tax
 a big deal
 that's a big deal
 so if you love your children it's good
 if you don't love your children it doesn't matter
 don't leave it to them if you don't love
 if your children are no good to you don't give them anything
 let them go out and work like hell
 no if you love… does anybody in this incredible audience… man this is a big building
 does anybody not love their children
 anybody
 do i have a hand
 do i have a… there's a hand
 you've got to be kidding
 you've got to be kidding
 so then you don't care about the tax
 okay don't worry about it
 he says no i don't care about that one
 well that's good
 you look like a nice guy too
 he's tough
 you'd love to be his kid wouldn't you
 but i also took the strongest ever action to confront china's massive theft of american jobs
 our strategy worked
 last month we signed a groundbreaking trade agreement with china that will defend our workers protect our intellectual property and boost american exports
 china will invest 250 billion a year into the united states and buy our products and create jobs
 nothing like that has ever happened before
 after years of building up other countries we are finally rebuilding our country
 that's the way we want it
 we are finally putting our country first
 we are putting america first
 on no issue have washington democrats more thoroughly sold out the american people than immigration
 you know it almost better than anybody
 anybody doug
 you know it better than anybody what they've done on your border but we're stopping that border
 that border is clogged and we've started the big wall right in arizona
 we build a lot of wall
 that's a big one
 that's a big one
 top of the line
 before i came into office the far left's policy of open borders allowed deadly drugs to flow freely into our country poisoning our children
 including as you know very well right here in arizona washington democrats put the needs of illegal immigrants before the wellbeing of american citizens
 they want to let anyone from around the world simply walk across the border
 then they want to give them a lifetime of free welfare healthcare everything
 they want to give them everything
 for a long period of time they were treated… you know this before i came
 they were treated far better than our veterans were treated
 now our veterans are treated great
 true
 illegal immigration costs arizona taxpayers more than 2 billion every year
 two billion you're paying
 nearly 20 of arizona's annual budget in general funds goes toward this big problem
 for the amount of money washington democrats want to spend supporting illegal immigrants we could rebuild our cities all throughout america which is what we should be doing
 under my administration we are finally taking care of our own citizens including millions and millions of legal immigrants who follow our laws pay their taxes and are entitled to a government that protects their families and their communities
 every day democrats' open borders policies are harming and killing innocent lives
 in arizona alone last year ice officers arrested over 4500 criminal aliens charged or convicted of dangerous offenses including robbery rape and murder
 right here in phoenix an illegal alien chased a man through a parking lot and shot him in cold blood then walked over to the victim and shot him four more times right in the face as he laid dying in the street
 this savage animal had previously been deported after serving six years in prison
 he was in prison six years
 he was there six years and nobody wants to talk about it
 they want to protect them
 last year in tucson another illegal alien was sentenced to 10 years for repeatedly raping a vulnerable young woman
 yet left wing politicians oppose all detention of illegal aliens even convicted criminals and they support deadly sanctuary cities that release these criminal aliens directly into america's communities
 thankfully arizona has banned sanctuary cities
 with a republican majority in congress we will ban them in every state in america
 30 in the morning
 i then went to california made two speeches
 i then went someplace else
 i said am i finished
 no you've got to go to arizona tonight and speak in front of like 25000 people
 i said that's okay
 that's okay
 i said that's okay
 no i said that's okay because i love this unbelievable energy in this crowd
 but you know what
 honestly there's tremendous energy in our nation
 there's tremendous energy in our nation
 greatest nation in the world
 thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border we have reduced illegal border crossings for eight straight months in a row which will soon be a record
 illegal crossings are down 75 since last spring
 the month of january saw the fewest illegal border crossings in two years
 and we've ended catch and release a horrible democrat policy that we got terminated
 border patrol great people have seized the largest amount of deadly narcotics ever recorded in the history of our country this year
 we've deported record numbers of gang members including the worst gang of all ms-13
 thousands and thousands of people have been thrown the hell out of our country
 we've done more to secure the border than any administration in history
 we're building the wall as i said faster than ever
 it will soon be almost one new mile a day
 we're looking for that
 washington democrats have never been more extreme taking cues from crazy bernie sanders
 how's he doing tonight
 132 congressional democrats have signed up for bernie's healthcare takeover of the world
 think of this 180 million americans are going to lose healthcare coverage under this plan
 but if you don't mind i'm not going to criticize it tonight
 let them keep going and i'll start talking about it about two weeks out from the election
 okay
 because i don't want him to change
 please don't change
 same with the green new deal
 i don't want to talk about it doug tonight
 i don't want to talk about it
 i came up with the name pocahontas
 too early
 but fortunately she's self-destructed anyway
 did you ever see a phony like that
 she's a phony
 she lost because she couldn't keep it straight on her own heritage
 she said she was an indian
 i said  i have more indian blood in me than you have and i have none
 she said oh and she panicked
 she panicked and she had a test
 you know the result 1124th
 i think i win the bet
 somewhere along the line i think i win
 no she… i did it too early
 i would have saved it but i guess it was effective
 she's essentially gone-zo so… one of those things
 while the socialist democrats are try- … one of those things
 while the socialist democrats are trying to destroy american healthcare and your social security my administration is protecting your social security your medicare and is fighting to give you great healthcare
 and that's what we're getting
 that's right
 one of the big secrets
 the democrats won't let us say it
 they want to keep that as quiet as possible
 look what they gave you the worst healthcare
 and what we've done we've gotten rid of things that nobody could believe that was so bad for you
 everybody was happy with defending your right to keep your doctor and plan of your choice
 we're making healthcare better and much much cheaper while premiums more than doubled in the last five years before i took office we are now offering plans that are up to 60 less expensive than they were and it's better healthcare
 a lot of people don't know this
 people don't know this
 they think that's their issue
 it's not
 they failed on healthcare
 we're protecting people with preexisting conditions and we always will
 and by the way we're trying to get rid of obamacare but we're managing it incredibly but we're trying to get rid so we can give you a great healthcare plan and protect preexisting conditions
 remember that
 we're trying to get rid of it but while we're having it we're managing it really much better than they did
 remember they built the 5 billion website
 remember that
 it was supposed to cost 5 million
 it cost 5 billion
 5 billion
 i mean you could get a kid out of high school
 i have a son
 he's a young boy 13
 he uses a computer
 he could have given them a healthcare site
 i would say he would have charged them 100 barron trump and it would've worked
 he's so good
 hi dad
 how you doing dad
 how's it going
 bing bing bong
 i said don't play with that while you're talking to me
 what's going on dad
 these kids are incredible right
 the kids they make us look like babies with that
 but he could have given you a great site for about 2
 they spent 5 billion on a site that never worked
 by the way speaking of that how did they do with their vote count in iowa
 and i hear i hear i don't want to say it
 i don't want to jinx them because of course i want them to do well but i do
 we don't have anything
 nobody's running against us in so many states
 it's sort of nice
 we can save the thunder right
 but i hear that in nevada
 i'm hearing bad things about their vote count
 i hear a lot of bad things are happening like they don't know what the hell they're doing
 i turned on the other night iowa i wanted to see … and by the way we set a record in the history of iowa
 we had more votes than anybody's ever had as an incumbent president
 same thing in new hampshire
 it's a good sign
 it's a good sign
 by a lot
 by the way by a lot
 but i'm hearing that and i hope this isn't the case because i'd like to find out who the hell won
 we still don't know who won in iowa
 i heard coming over here they're still working on the count
 no no no
 he said you won
 yeah i think we did win
 i think we did
 very good
 that's very good
 i have to thank you that one
 that's very good
 no we did win
 look we are winning
 we're winning big
 we have fake polls out there
 these guys do fake polls
 they are fake polls
 i had a poll
 it's just like it was in 2016
 i'd hear these polls
 i'd hear women didn't like me and i did great with women
 i hear everyone didn't like me
 nobody liked me
 nobody liked me
 and then we won
 thank you women
 nobody liked me 2016
 no no i hear that
 remember women didn't like him and at the end of that he did great with women
 he did great with this
 he did great with everybody
 we did great with everybody
 remember 306 to 223
 that's a slaughter
 that's a slaughter
 remember they said he cannot get they used the word path
 there is no path right to 270
 i was at 269 if i did great but they said there's no chance
 but i was at 269 so i went to maine
 i love maine
 i went to maine
 maine's cut in half
 and one maine has one
 i went there four or five times
 people are great
 i won it
 and they were right
 there is no path to 270 but there was a path to 306
 these people
 these people
 there is no path
 that's right doug
 they said there is no path the fake news media
 there is no path for donald trump
 and then they said the evening of the election it's going to be a really short night for donald trump
 thank god we got rid of this guy
 because they did the exit polls going out right
 and i was even told but a lot of people didn't want to talk about it
 the highest number in history of people that said very nasty language but i'm not going to use that name because you'll kill me if i use it
 so i won't use it
 it's a much better story if i use it because that's the truth
 that's what they said
 how did you vote
 usually they say i voted for clinton or i voted for trump
 right
 how'd you vote
 none of your business
 see i'm being nice right
 i'll keep it that way because otherwise we'll ruin the whole evening
 they'll say his language right
 even this tough guy in the front says i agree
 how did you vote
 no i don't want to tell you
 how did you vote
 none of your damn business
 i'm not going to tell you
 how did you vote
 i'm not …  and it was like this massive number right
 massive
 so everybody they just didn't count that
 so they said numbers are looking unbelievably well for crooked hillary clinton
 they're looking unbelievable
 this is going to be a very short evening for donald trump
 we finally will be rid of this guy
 and then the numbers started coming in
 the numbers started coming in and it started with the great state of florida
 donald trump has won the state of florida
 and then that beautiful convention center the most beautiful stage i've ever seen
 and they knew something was going on because they didn't pay the final payment for the fireworks two weeks before
 right
 in fact i went to the fireworks company and i said i'll give you five cents on the dollar for your fireworks even though they were no way near where my area was
 we were at a hotel in midtown
 we liked the location better than where she chose but they built the most … we remember that beautiful stage
 it was shaped like the united states of america
 and by the end it didn't look too good
 did you ever see more unhappy people
 so they go donald trump has won the great state of florida
 they go whoa whoa whoa
 they outspent me like five to one
 only negative ads
 they're all negative
 so by the time people got into the voters booth they only knew one thing
 she hated donald trump but they said what the hell does she stand for
 what does she do
 every ad was a negative ad
 so it tells you negative ads at least against me aren't so good
 they can be effective
 but i think they spent like  2 billion on negative ads
 everything was negative
 so nobody knew what the hell she spent
 you know her husband said she was going to lose
 her husband's a professional
 her husband said you better go to michigan because i was there and they got a trumppence sign on every lawn i've ever seen
 you better go to wisconsin hillary
 you better go to wisconsin
 she said no we haven't lost wisconsin in 36 years
 no no hillary you got to go there
 i'm telling you i don't like what i saw
 no what do you know
 he's a professional politician
 she wasn't
 it's one of those little problems in life
 so then it came in and then we won south carolina
 we won north carolina
 right
 and we were leading pennsylvania by so much that if i lost remember at 2 of the vote left if i lost every single vote i win by a lot
 they refused the fake news refused to call it
 i kept saying we won pennsylvania
 why don't they call it
 it was very late in the evening when they called it because they are fake they're crooked
 they are fake
 and i said why don't they call pennsylvania
 but some beautiful things happened
 and by the way ohio we won by one of the largest margins ever
 the great great great state of ohio
 remember
 remember they used to say a year before the election they said well nobody can win
 nobody unless you win the great state of ohio
 and we won the great state of ohio and we won it big
 we knew we were going to win it
 and now we're up a lot more than we were up even then because you know why
 we're bringing back jobs
 we're bringing back factories
 everybody's working
 nobody's ever had a better year than we've been having
 and we've been doing it for a long time right
 almost from the beginning
 and don't let them try and take credit because if they came in we would have ended up in a massive recession or worse the d word depression
 we would have been because they were going to put more and more and more regulations on
 and i'll tell you maybe bigger than even the tax cuts and i did it sooner were the regulation cuts
 we freed up our nation to go back to work
 true
 so then we won wisconsin and then we won michigan because those companies now they're pouring back in
 the auto companies are pouring back in and wisconsin's doing great with the farmers that canada was taking
 you know canada was charging our farmers 287 tariffs for dairy products
 okay
 so what happens is this we're working on healthcare
 we're fighting to stop surprise medical billing
 i just signed an executive order imposing price transparency because when providers are required to show their prices those same prices fall very fast
 we've approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs which are just as good as the brand drugs but they cost a tiny fraction
 we've totally transformed veteran's healthcare including getting long-sought va choice and va accountability which they said could not be done
 and we passed the spectacular right to try
 so if you're in trouble and i hope nobody in this massive arena's in trouble but if you're in trouble you can go and get whatever the new drug or whatever where we have the best doctors best hospital best labs
 you get it
 and the luck we are having we are saving so many lives
 it's incredible what's happening
 people would go to europe
 they'd go to asia
 if they had no money they'd go home and die
 now they have the right to use our drugs before they're approved
 think of that
 before they're approved
 and we're very importantly combating the opioid epidemic
 drug overdose deaths
 the overdose deaths have declined for the first time in 34 years and life expectancy is rising again in our nation
 we've launched bold new initiatives combating kidney disease and alzheimer's disease
 we're making tremendous progress and we're pursuing new advances in neo-medical research
 think of that neonatal research the numbers are incredible
 what's happened is incredible to care for america's youngest patients and breaking all records in doing so
 all of the radical democrats in the presidential debates have declared their unlimited support for extreme late-term abortion ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up until the very moment of birth
 that is why in my state of the union i asked congress to prohibit late-term abortion of babies because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from god
 the democrat party is the party of high taxes high crime open borders late-term abortion socialism blatant corruption and the total destruction of your second amendment
 the republican party is the party of the american worker the american family the american dream the second amendment and the late great abraham lincoln right
 republicans are fighting for citizens from every background every community and every walk of life
 we are the party of boundless optimism excitement energy and enthusiasm
 we have tremendous energy
 tremendous energy
 everybody says to me where do you get the energy
 because i love what we're doing
 i see the results and they're happening faster than you even think
 you see the numbers
 they're happening faster than you would even think
 we are asking all americans to join our incredible movement
 we are the big tent
 we are the big party
 we are the party with big ideas for the future
 republicans are fighting for school choice because no parent should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school
 right
 right
 to keep our community safer and give former prisoners a second chance at life
 there's been nothing like this
 i passed criminal justice reform not the democrats
 i did it with the republicans and this could not have been done by anybody but me and the republican party
 the democrats did not do it
 they could never have done it
  neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh
 we have invested 2
2 trillion to rebuild the united states military including nearly 200 million for marine corps air station yuma
 right
 i recognized israel as the true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem
 we recognize israel sovereignty over the golan heights
 they've been trying to get it for 52 years
 and for years you watched as your politicians apologized for america
 you saw that
 they apologized
 now you have a president who is standing up for america and we are standing up for the people of arizona
 at stake in our present battle is the survival of our nation
 it is
 this election is so important
 it's the survival of our nation
 if you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of americans have fought and died for to secure then we must devote everything we have toward victory in november of 2020
 you're the forgotten people no more
 right
 no deplorables right
 no deplorables
 who knew that was going to turn out to be such a disaster
 but you know she used the worst word
 what was the word she used
 irredeemables right
 i thought that was the problem
 no it was deplorable
 so what the hell do i know about politics
 she said you're irredeemable and deplorable
 i said oh that irredeemable's terrible
 the next day people are showing up
 women i'm a deplorable
 only this way can we save the america we love and drain the washington swamp which is vicious horrible ugly and evil
 much worse than i thought
 but we're getting there and not pleasant
 a bunch of really bad people very dishonest people
 with your help we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work from dependence to independence and from poverty to prosperity
 together we will elect a republican congress to create a fair safe sane and lawful system of immigration
 we will continue to enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with those beautiful beautiful words and phrase
 i love the phrase made in the usa
 made in the usa
 we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the aids epidemic in america within now nine years
 we started a year ago
 can you imagine that
 we're doing that and it's going to happen
 who would have thought we could have done that
 we will land the first woman on the moon and become the first nation in the world to plant our flag on mars
 we will defend privacy free speech and you know this
 you know it's under siege religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms
 we will defend it
 it's under siege
 it's under siege
 you see it in virginia
 they want to take away the guns
 above all we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one beautiful america
 we support protect and defend the constitution of the united states
 we stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement
 we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life
 we believe that faith and family not government and bureaucracy are the true american way
 we believe that children should be taught to love our country honor our history and to always respect our great american flag
 and we live by the words of our national motto in god we trust
 from tucson to tombstone right
 do you agree
 you agree right
 look at him
 he's agreeing this guy
 he's agreeing
 no more censorship is right
 no more evil
 no more crimes
 you're right
 from yuma to mesa and from flagstaff to right here in phoenix we stand on the shoulders of red-blooded american patriots who poured their heart sweat and soul to secure our liberty and to defend our freedom
 arizona was founded by pioneers and prospectors great prospectors cowboys and miners and ranchers who tamed the wilderness braved the blazing sun and it is hot here
 i've been here during the summer
 i want to tell you it's seriously hot
 of course didn't they say that president clinton when he went on the back of the plane was here to play golf it was 121 degrees that day
 i don't know about that
 i don't know about that
 what do you think he was doing with the attorney general
 i remember he said oh i just happened to see she was … i was here to play golf
 it was 120 degrees out
 i don't know
 a lot of crooked stuff went on
 i wonder what they talked about
 i'm sure it wasn't that she would become a supreme court justice
 i'm sure it wasn't that they were going to extend her tenure as attorney general
 she was a real beauty
 i'm sure it wasn't
 i'm sure it was nothing
 they spent 45 minutes on the plane talking about golf and their grandchildren
 right
 can't let it happen folks
 can't let it happen
 we can't let it happen
 you fought the battles and helped make this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth and we are making it greater every single day than ever before

 i don't want you going to your governor saying governor governor we just can't stand winning so much
 please go see the president in the oval office
 governor the people of arizona don't want to keep on winning
 it's too much governor
