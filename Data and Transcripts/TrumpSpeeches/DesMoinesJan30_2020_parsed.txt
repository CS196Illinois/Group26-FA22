 i'm thrilled to be back in american heartland with thousands of loyal hardworking american patriots
 great people
 this november we're going to defeat the radical socialist democrats that are right down the street
 i mean i don't even know
 i just saw new york times can you believe
 failing new york timesâ€¦ when we leave in 10 14 18 22 years from now the new york times will be out of business and so will a lot of others
 but did you see they did a new york times poll i think and sienna sienna new york times of iowa and they have me pitted against every one of the socialists and we're winning by a lot
 everyone
 we're beating them all
 we're beating them all
 we're beating them all
 we're beating them like they haven't been beaten before
 you know all the noises about their crazy debates nobody's watching their debates but it's all about their debates
 they don't care about the farmer
 everything out here they love trump and you should love trump with what i've done
 so we're going to win the great state of iowa and it's going to be a historic landslide
 if we don't win your farms are going to hell
 i can tell you right now
 sell sell they'll be saying sell
 no we love the farmers and we love the ranchers and we love the manufacturers frankly
 you got plenty of that too in this state
 the great state and you have a great governor by the way
 you have a great governor
 but every day we're achieving extraordinary victories for the citizens of the hawkeye state
 the iowa unemployment rate has reached an all time low in history
 that's not bad
 that's not bad
 oh let's vote for pocahontas
 let's vote for bernie
 let's vote for sleepy joe
 he's falling asleep
 joe joe joe
 he always gets the name wrong
 how many times has he missed it
 he's in iowa
 he says great to be in the great state of ohio
 they say joe you're in iowa
 you can't do that
 no matter how great you speak
 if you're winston churchill if you make that mistake at the beginning of your speech it's over
 you might as well just wrap it up
 there's the fake news
 they would just absolutely destroy you
 they would absolutely destroy you
 you can't do that
 you can't do that joe sleepy joe but you have these guys
 you have these people
 how about buttigieg
 buttigieg
 they call him mayor pete
 you know why
 because nobody can pronounce his name
 nobody has any idea
 buttigieg
 they say say edge edge
 he presides over a city that's failed
 it's doing so badly in a state that's having the greatest year they've ever had and they have a great governor also and they had a great governor
 you just heard from him right
 the great state of indiana so i don't see that one
 go down the line
 we have some people
 let's not talk about them
 what happened to mini mike
 where is he
 he's not running
 he's skipping four or five states
 mini mike
 i've had him up to here
 more people are working right now in iowa than ever before
 now think of it
 think of it
 yesterday we replaced a nafta disaster with the incredible brand new u
s
 mexico canada agreement
 the usmca you know when you have a hard time with that one memory is a great thing
 i've always had a great memory for whatever reason but memory is a great thing
 having a great memory but sometimes you take little clues
 usmca
 thank you darling
 i love you too
 where is that person up
 look at that
 wow
 what a good strong voice
 but you know how you remember it
 the song i just walked in on
 they're playing the song ymca
 so when you're having a hard time gee what's u-s just think of the song ymca and you'll remember it usmca
 it's a massive win for iowa farmers and workers of all kinds
 it's a massive win and it creates some fairness with canada
 it creates fairness with mexico
 probably the biggest reason that i ran was the unfair trade that i've seen and one after one china mexico canada japan south korea we've made all these deals and we have plenty left over
 plenty left over
 europe europe europe is next
 i wanted to finish china before we started on europe
 i like to do them one at a time one at a time
 i'm a very organized person
 but weeks ago we also signed a terrific new trade agreement with china that will boost american agriculture by 50 billion every year and many other businesses like manufacturing banking finance overall 250 billion and you know with the farmers because i have a place in my heart for the farmers big
 i went and i saw ambassador lighthizer's in charge he's fantastic
 i said what are you doing
 we're getting ready for the final deal
 what are you doing
 he said i'm putting in 20 billion
 because i asked sonny perdue
 he's great
 you know who he is right
 secretary of agriculture
 i said sonny what's the biggest number that china's ever done with the farmers
 he said sir 16 billion last year
 16 billion
 this was two years ago
 i said so 16 billion is the biggest because you know they targeted you and now we're friends with china
 in fact maybe we've never had a better relationship and were working with them very closely on the coronavirus
 we're working with them very very closely
 we only have five people
 hopefully everything's going to be great
 they have somewhat of a problem but hopefully it's all going to be great
 but we're working with china just so you know and other countries very very closely so it doesn't get out of hand but it's something that we have to be very very careful with right
 we have to be very careful
 but i said to sonny perdue secretary of agriculture i said sonny what's the number
 16 and 12 the year before and you were targeted
 i don't blame china
 look they're smart
 they're negotiators
 they targeted trump states
 where do they love trump
 they love him in iowa
 they love him in nebraska
 they love him in all these states
 they love him in wisconsin
 they love him
 we won wisconsin
 they like him and wisconsin and a lot of the farm states and they targeted
 the farmers came to see me and they said sir you have to do what's right
 when the fake news would interview farmers the farmers would say no no president trump is doing the right thing
 it should have been done years ago
 should've been done years and years ago
 but you couldn't have made it because there was too much money 16 billion
 so what i did is i put a 25 tariff on everything coming in from china 250 billion and then more tariffs on things beyond the 250 billion market
 we took in billions and billions and billions of dollars
 we still are and then what happened
 when i heard about the farmers and i saw the farmers they were in the white house
 they came to see me
 i had 36 farmers and i said i'm going to give you
 they said sir we don't want anything
 i said what do you mean you don't want anything
 i've never heard that before
 everybody wants money
 they want every
 they said we just want a level playing field
 i never forgot it
 they said we don't want anything
 we just want a level playing field and we've been treated badly for years for years
 i said well you haven't been given a level playing field for many many years for decades
 you haven't been given a level playing field
 we're going to give you the levelest field that you ever had
 but but in the meantime i'm going to give you 12 billion out of these tens of billions that we're collecting
 don't worry
 we had plenty of left over because we never got 25 cents from china
 china took from us
 we didn't take from china right
 i said i'm going to give you 12 billion for the year before and i'm going to give you 16 billion for this year
 that was last year for this year
 so they got meaning you a lot of you in this audience got 12 billion and you got 16 so you got 28 billion over that short period of time and you were able to actually in some cases i guess thrive
 i told sonny i want to take care of the small farmer too not just the big monsters
 i want to take care of everyone everyone
 but i never forgot when cnn fake news and all these people they go around interviewing the farmers
 they could never find anyone saying bad about trump
 they'd go into diners
 what do you think about trump
 isn't it a terrible what he's doing with the trade
 the farmer would say no he's doing what should have been done 20 years ago
 now you people are going to make so much money
 you're not going to do just you know what
 just relax
 take it easy
 put it away
 enjoy your life
 but you're going to make a lot of money
 you're going to make a lot of money
 again we have never had because they respect us now they didn't respect us
 we have never had a better relationship with china than we do right now
 it's a beautiful story
 they respect us
 the whole world respects us now
 we're respected again
 america is respected again
 okay
 we're fighting for products made in america and grown right here in this great great state of iowa
 to keep america safe we have fully rebuilt the united states military
 it's now stronger more powerful more lethal than ever before
 we have all brand new equipment and it was all built in the usa
 thanks to the courage of american heroes the isis caliphate has been totally destroyed and its founder and leader the animal known as al-baghdadi is dead
 crazy nancy pelosi said don't call him an animal
 he's a human being
 no he's an animal
 he's an animal
 two weeks ago at my direction the united states military delivered another historic win for american justice
 our brave warriors launched a flawless precision strike that killed the world's number one terrorist qasem soleimani
 qasem soleimani
 he was the mastermind of the road side bomb
 he loved roadside bombs
 when you see your friends and great soldiers of our country and other countries frankly walking around they don't have legs they don't have arms in some cases
 some cases they don't have both
 you see them walking around or riding around or the most brave people these people have the greatest attitude
 i go to walter reed and i see him and the young man his legs were blown off
 how you doing
 sir i want to get back
 i want to get back sir
 i'll tell you the spirit of these people it may even top the farmers
 it may even top the farmers which is pretty good
 but he was responsible more than anybody else 90 they say of these roadside bombs sent to fight us he was responsible and he took a hard hit
 he took a very hard hit
 he was responsible for murdering and maiming thousands and thousands of americans and hundreds of thousands of other people
 not acceptable
 soleimani was actively planning new attacks but we ended his bloody rampage forever
 yet washington democrats true like crazy bernie and nancy pelosi opposed our decision to eliminate soleimani and to save american lives
 that had a tremendous impact
 while we're proudly creating jobs and killing terrorists congressional democrats are consumed with partisan rage and obsessed with a deranged witch hunt hoax
 you know we're having probably the best years that we've ever had in the history of our country and i just got impeached
 can you believe these people
 i got impeached
 they impeached trump
 the best trade deals the strongest military i took care of the vets
 we got choice
 we got accountability for the vets accountability
 we got all these things and they impeach your president
 no that's not going to work
 watch just watch
 they want to nullify your ballots poison our democracy and overthrow the entire system of government
 that's not happening i can tell you that
 washington democrats have spent the last three years trying to overturn the last election
 why am i not worried
 i should worried
 remember nixon it was like a dark period right
 it's a very dark period
 it was like oh you think about it
 right
 with clinton it was not good
 they say that with johnson it was a long time ago none of us remember but they say it was a very dark period
 this is a happy period for us
 it's a happy period
 it's a happy period because we call this impeachment light
 this is light
 crazy schiff
 shifty schiff
 he's a sick puppy
 he's a sick puppy
 but you know what
 today you saw it i hit my highest poll numbers since i got elected because the american people and frankly people all over the world know it's a hoax
 they understand it
 they know it's a hoax and we have a great party the republican party
 they know what's going on
 they know what's going on and they're going to treat us very fairly
 but the democrats are trying to overturn the last election
 we will make sure that they face another crushing defeat in 2020
 november 3 november 3 mark it off
 november 3 mark it off
 was that a great day
 2016 november
 remember
 he's not going to do well with this group
 i did well
 he's not going to do well with that group
 i won that group
 he's not going to do well here or there
 even the exit polls they took it right up
 you know what they didn't know about the exit polls
 when people are leaving they're always very accurate
 people leave
 who you voted for
 i voted for trump
 who you voted for
 i voted for crooked hillary
 i don't care that she's a stone cold crook
 i'm voting for her
 who are you voting for
 i'm voting for trump or clinton or trump
 they're always very accurate but this time something happened
 many people manyâ€¦ i like that idea
 i like it
 i like it
 wouldn't we like to run against her
 who's tougher
 her crazy bernie biden buttigieg
 who would be the closest
 buttigieg
 i don't know
 maybe we take another crack at crazy hillary
 would that be okay
 she was so easy
 remember that speech so innocently given talking about deplorables
 remember
 remember deplorables
 but you know the only thing i didn't understand i said that's terrible
 but she said another word that was worse
 irredeemables
 i said boy shows you how good i am at politics i said she's in trouble
 she said our people are irredeemable
 to me that was worse
 well it wasn't that word that caught on
 it was deplorable
 the next day i'm speaking and women are walking around i'm deplorable
 everyone's got deplorable
 i say i think she made a bad speech last night
 but irredeemable remember
 she called them deplorable and irredeemable and me being so brilliant i said i think that irredeemables going to get her
 no deplorable got her
 a lot her like lack of ability
 together we are going to win back the house
 we are going to hold the senate and we are going to keep that beautiful gorgeous incredible white house
 people don't realize this is a lot of work
 i just left michigan and michigan is booming now because of me meaning my people
 i say to prime minister abe he's a friend of mine shinzo japan you got to do something
 you got these massive deficits for our country
 you got to open up plants in michigan fast shinzo
 fast
 you've got to do it
 yes i will do it
 he'll do it and he's doing it
 countries are coming in from all over the world
 they're going to michigan
 they're coming to iowa
 they're buying your stuff again like crazy like crazy
 they're going to ohio
 they're going to pennsylvania
 they're going to south carolina
 they're going to north carolina
 they're going to florida
 they're coming in like never before
 they're all coming back
 i ran on the issue trade
 i ran on a lot of different issues but trade was one of them
 that was so big
 to me it was so big
 i used to say how do we allow these companies to close fire everybody go to another country
 mexico wherever it may be make product sell the product into our country pay no tax
 who the hell would allow this to happen
 who would allow to happen
 it's like in south korea
 i went to him i said listen your deal is no good
 we have to make a new deal
 south korea we're protecting them all all these different things
 i said number one you've got to pay us more
 they agreed to
 they gave us 500 million a year more
 they said but nobody has ever asked
 they gave us 500
 that's nothing compared to what they have to do
 that's okay
 that's okay
 they'll pay more
 but you know they made a trade deal with the united states
 hillary clinton was in charge of the deal right
 she said it's going to produce 250000 jobs and she was right
 250000
 you know who it was for
 for south korea not for us it was for south korea
 so we renegotiated the deal if i have your permission we renegotiated the deal and now we have a good deal with south korea okay
 this deal is going to produce rememberâ€¦ this deal is going to produce 250000 jobs for south korea
 she didn't lie
 can't say she lied
 she lies about a lot of other things but she didn't lie
 how is she taking her defeat
 okay
 i think so
 remember the debate
 do you promise if you lose that you will support the winner and i sort of i didn't exactly say yes
 i didn't say yes in all fairness but i got sort of like six the 68 there
 but she said see he won't
 she's the one that doesn't do it
 no no i feel badly because it's too late for her to get in
 i kept hoping but i think honestly i think that sleepy joe crazy bernie i don't even want to put buttigieg in but i think they'd actually be tougher than her
 during this campaign season the good people of iowa have had a front row seat to the lunacy and the madness of the totally sick left
 this is a radical left people that we're dealing with
 today's democrat party i don't say democratic party it sounds so much better in a speech right
 democratic party the democrat but that's not their name
 it's called the democrat party
 you know some people aren't allowed to say the democrat party because it doesn't sound good
 i don't even like it
 i don't like the way it sounds in this speech but i'm going to say it because i'm not looking to have them look good
 today's democrat party is run by left wing extremists who want to massively raise your taxes increase regulations cancel your health plans raid medicare shut down american energy destroy your social security they will destroy your social security eliminate religious liberty punish free speech confiscate your guns abolish your borders and indoctrinate america's children with hateful left-wing ideology
 other than that they're okay
 other than that they're fine people
 in short this election is a choice between american freedom and democratic socialism and in some cases in my opinion it's worse than socialism
 socialism's a kind word by comparison
 the democrats will lose because america will never be a socialist country
 we can't
 they're all watching tonight
 they're sitting in their hotel room little hotels right down the street and they're looking at this crowd
 the press never talks about my crowds
 did you see in new jersey a couple of nights ago
 we had signups for 175000 people
 we had an arena that held about 9000 people
 we could have sold it out 15 times
 okay
 they don't talk about that
 you know what they talk about
 they said donald trump who spoke before a nice crowd
 if bernie or sleepy joe has i mean joe had a crowd that was so small the other day that they set up a round table
 no it's true
 no they were in a gymnasium
 there were in a gymnasium and they set up a round table and people that went there to hear his speech are now being asked what do you think of socialism
 they just said i just want to be here to watch his speech
 they set up a round- they just said i just want to be here to watch a speech
 they set up a round table because the crowd was so small and then they'll say it was a brilliant round table
 it was wonderful
 they never mention crowds
 they never mention crowds
 they never mention anything
 i'll tell you u
s
m
c
a the biggest trade deal ever signed in the history of the world
 okay
 it is wait
 it barely got any mention
 we signed it
 it barely got any mention
 they talk about the impeachment hoax
 they talk about all the other stuff but the trade deal that is going to change our country
 it's going to bring growth
 wait until you see toward the end of next year the growth will be astronomical because of the china trade deal the u
s
m
c
a japan south korea europe when that happens
 it will happen because they have no choice
 they have no choice
 but in the papers and on the fake news cable shows and the regular look nbc is horrible the nbc nightly news it's terrible
 the good news is people don't watch it like they used to because they don't believe in it
 they don't believe in it
 and as sean hannity would say msdnc you know what msdnc is right so bad
 cnn total fake stuff
 oops their camera just went off
 look
 the camera just went off
 cnn
 their camera just went off
 that always happens whenever i say cnn their camera goes off
 but americans across the political spectrum were disgusted by the washington democrats the partisan hoaxes the witch hunts the con jobs
 it's all a con job
 and so they don't love our country i swear they don't
 you look at nancy pelosi's district in san francisco
 it was so beautiful and now it's a disgrace being watched all over the world
 needles all over the place everything else all over the place
 i'm not going to get into it washing down into the ocean washing down onto their beaches people living in tents if they're lucky
 i mean you never saw anything living on their most important entryways into what was a great city san francisco
 what's happened
 and all she does is work on the hoax and work on all of the stuff
 really these people are very very bad for our country
 we have to take back the house of representatives we have to
 registered democrats and independents are leaving the democrat party in droves and we are welcoming these people and these great voters to the republican party with wide open arms
 and we are thrilled to be joined tonight by a lot of your great leaders a lot of your really wonderful people
 i'm not going to mention all the names because all those cameras that are rolling they don't like it when i do it but one they don't mind is governor kim reynolds
 come up kim come up here
 also first gentleman kevin reynolds kevin
 kim come on come on
 you want to say something
 great great job
 thank you
 oh she was driving me a little bit batty
 she would call me up kim you would call
 what about ethanol
 i said kim i mean i'm doing a lot for that place
 no no
 we want ethanol
 then we want biofuel
 then she is asking for things i never even heard of but we got them all whatever that hell she wanted we got
 right
 and by the way joni ernst and the great chuck grassley are right now in washington fighting for fairness fighting the hoax fighting for all of us

 lieutenant governor adam gregg

 speaker of the iowa house of representatives a man with really fantastic genes got to have like the best genes in the world
 although you had an ex-governor here that had very good genes too
 we have his son in the audience too but this is representatives pat grassley
 those genes those two young men have the greatest genes anyone has ever had for politics
 thank you fellas thanks
 i sent one of them the father to china and he's now ambassador to china
 do you think he is happy
 is he happy
 i think so
 i think he is happy
 great governor longest serving governor in history actually 24 years
 we have the chairman of the republican party of iowa jeff kaufmann
 great job
 and just quickly we have the world's tallest campaign manager brad parscale
 and republican national committee co-chair who has done an incredible job tommy hicks
 and we have the great negotiator the great man bob lighthizer with us here someplace
 where's bob
 what a job he did negotiating for you
 and we have somebody that you never heard of somebody that's a fantastic person but you never heard of somebody named sarah sanders
 have you ever heard of her
 come here sarah
 come on
 that's pretty good
 and we have a great football player from iowa matt whitaker is here matt
 say something
 thank you sarah
 very popular
 she is a terrific person great person
 thanks to republican leadership american now has the hottest economy anywhere on the planet earth not even close
 every prime minister president king queen dictator whatever you want to call them they all say how did you do it
 and the truth is we have certain advantages but we also have a people advantage
 we have the greatest people in the world
 i really mean that
 since the election we have created seven million new jobs
 the average unemployment rate under my administration listen to this is lower than any previous administration in the history of our country
 can you believe that
 the lowest unemployment rate
 african american hispanic american and asian american unemployment rates have reached the lowest levels ever recorded think of that
 more than two million millennials you know what millennials are young great people with a lot of future they have gotten jobs and their wages have grown by nearly 5 annually
 that's a record
 another record is that between the ages of 25 and 34 people are now working and that's a record the number of people 25 to 34
 and under the so-called trump economy the lowest paid earners are reaping the fastest gains of any group
 and that's a great thing
 this is a blue collar boom and that's a good thing too
 that's a good thing
 earnings for the bottom 10 are rising faster than earnings for the top 10 for the first time ever for the first time ever
 and median household income is at an all time high just for one second president bush eight years 450
 president barack hussein obama eight years eight years 975
 president donald john trump two and a half years not three because the numbers were taken at two and a half now it's actually higher
 two and a half years including the tax cuts which are massive and including all of the regulatory cuts and the other things you have gotten 10000
 think of it
 you have eight years 450
 eight years 975
 two and a half years think of it 10000
 it's one of the reasons the economy is doing so well
 and let the people down the road tell you about that okay
 let them tell you about that
 and those tractors that i told you to buy your tractors will be 60 years old if they have anything to do with it
 they will be 60 years old
 they will be old tired exhausted
 your land will be exhausted
 you will be exhausted
 we've ended the war on american energy
 the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on earth by far
 we are also proudly promoting american ethanol and i recently approved e15 to be used all year round
 biofuel also but the socialist democrats want to shut down american energy
 they support representative ocasio-cortez
 it's a real beauty
 that's a real beauty
 that's a beauty
 i can't even believe it but i don't want to knock it because the green new deal which would crush our farms destroy our wonderful cows
 i love cows
 they want to kill our cows
 you know why right
 you know why
 don't say it
 they want to kill our cows
 that means you are next
 and they want to wipe out totally iowa ethanol
 they want to wipe it out
 but we will never let that side get in and by the way that's the least of it
 but i don't want to attack the green new deal because they might change it
 i said to her the other day they said what do you think of the green new deal
 i said well it should be studied carefully
 we should look at it look at it closely
 i don't want to talk about until about two months before the election
 and then i will tell you how totally insane it is
 how about this crazy senator
 how about this crazy crazy senator from hawaii
 they said i'm totally in favor not the smartest
 she said i'm totally in favor of the green new deal
 well that would mean there's no more airplanes
 oh
 they started screaming at her in hawaii they said how the hell are we going to get to hawaii
 they said we're going to build a railroad
 she said that would be the world's longest track
 it's the world's longest
 she doesn't know that they don't want airplanes anymore and yet they fly around in brand new gulfstreams in brand new planes all over the place
 they're flying from place to place
 they're talking about the carbon footprint
 we're going to destroy the carbon footprint
 what time is my plane taking off please
 to lift up forgotten communities the republican tax cut launched opportunity zones jobs and investment and now rushing into over 60 newlyâ€¦ and this is incredible brand newly designated opportunity zones right here in iowa alone
 rich people are investing vast amounts of money
 tim scott senator tim scott south carolina came into my office
 he said i have an idea that i have wanted to do for years but we have never had a president that could pull it off
 i said what is it tim
 and he talked about opportunity zones first time i heard it
 and we did it and there is nothing nobody has ever seen anything like it
 money is being poured into these communities that would have never been there
 what's happening is incredible
 opportunity zones
 remember it
 for decades politicians ran for office promising to protect american farmers and workers
 you've heard it all your lives right
 but then they went to washington
 they looked at those beautiful marble columns and that gorgeous ceiling painted and all that gold the way they used to build the buildings they don't build them that way anymore
 we could but they just don't know how
 by the way we're building the wall
 you know the wall is over a hundred miles long
 it's over a hundred miles long already and moving fast
 they went to washington and they sold you out
 that's what happened
 they sold your jobs out
 they sold everything out
 globalist politicians allowed other countries to raid our factories ravage our farms rob our workers and ransack our communities
 but the era of economic surrender is over because now we are finally putting america first america first
 before i took office washington looked the other way while china stole our secrets from american agriculture
 your business what they do scientifically nobody understands what they have done to a seed
 it doesn't sound complicated
 it is genius what they have been able to do what you have been able to do
 but those secrets were being stolen stolen
 and installed massive barriers to your exports
 you couldn't do anything with exports so people not only china many many other places were stealing your secrets
 our new agreement with china will protect our intellectual property and pry open vast new markets for american beef pork poultry seafood soybeans rice dairy and much much more
 but you know it is true
 china is so big
 1
5 billion people
 we have 350
 1
5 billion people think of that and we are just touching it
 this deal will be so big
 if it all works out and you have the best product the best product in the world if it all works out it will just keep expanding
 250 billion will end up being much much more than that
 and i've told this story before when we were signing we were almost finished and i said how much are the farmers getting
 meaning how much are they going to purchase from the farmers
 and ambassador lighthizer said we put 20 billion sir
 the highest ever was 16 so we made it 20
 i said make it 50
 they said what
 and then people even farm people said sir we can't produce that much
 i said that's a good problem not a bad problem
 i said make it 50 so we now have in the contract from 40 to 50 billion worth of purchase
 make it 50 make it 50
 right jared
 i said jared you better make it 50
 i want those farmers to come back say sir sir we can't do it
 we can't produce that much sir what are you doing to us
 i don't think that would ever happen
 do you think that would ever i said they will figure a way
 he's going absolutely not
 nah i said don't make it 20 make it 50
 the u

 is another colossal victory for american agriculture like you have never had before
 it's time
 we suffered for a year and a half almost two years
 think of it but not really because i was able to give you those i won't call them subsidies
 i made that mistake once with the farmers
 i said to this group of farmers that came in subsidy
 i used the word subsidy
 that was the worst word sir we don't watch subsidy
 please don't ever use that word
 i said i won't i promise
 just in that small little grouping where you were doing nothing
 it's called promises made promises kept
 promises met
 the last time i came i never did this before i never ran so they all said you never ran before
 you can't do this if you never ran so whatever happened it happened
 one by one they started dropping out right
 and then i was left with one hillary clinton and that worked out very nicely
 he cannot get to 270 remember
 270 electoral college
 he cannot get to 270
 i went to maine
 it's true maine too
 it's got one point right one
 i went there a lot many times
 everyone said well they kept getting me maybe if i have a great night 269 but 269 loses
 right
 but we got 306 to 223
 306 223 so they were right you cannot get to 270 you can get to 306 but not that there isâ€¦ in the eight years before my election net farm income plummeted by 20 you know that
 if you look at a chart for 15 years actually not eight for 15 years it's like a roller coaster ride down for the farmer
 soybeans
 take a look at it all
 it was just a one way street
 everybody was ripping off the american farmer
 now you're going to see numbers that are going to be great
 look at even what's happened recently
 it's incredible what's going on and i love it because you deserve it
 you suffered a lot with people that were stupid
 they were stupid
 under three years of my administration net farm income has already gone up nearly 50 and will now be rising even faster
 what are you going to do
 you are going to vote for bernie
 you are going to vote for bernie
 here i am on the debate stage well net income has gone up for the farmers 50
 tell me how the hell do i lose this debate
 how do i lose
 and based on the polls i guess i'm not going to lose in this state
 i don't think i will lose in any other state either
 because this is really true all over the country
 this is happening all over the country not just iowa
 on no issue have washington democrats more thoroughly betrayed the american people than on immigration
 illegal immigration costs our nation hundreds of billions of dollars drains public services overcrowds our schools and hospitals and threatens innocent american lives at a number that you wouldn't even believe
 but we have got it closed up but we're getting your people in
 you have people that have worked for you for a long time don't you
 i know who the people that you have and they are hard workers
 we have a lot of great people
 you have a lot of great people out there
 right here in des moines a twice deported illegal alien was charged with shooting and killing a woman her 11-year-old daughter and her five-year-old son
 in this region of the county alone last year ice officers arrested nearly 4000 illegal aliens charged or convicted of heinous crimes including robbery rape and murder
 yet today's democrat party glorifies illegal immigration
 we have no idea now we do now but people would come in by the hundreds of thousands
 we have no idea who they are
 many are fine people and all of that but some are stone cold rapists and murderers and people that their countries don't want guatemala honduras el salvador and even mexico
 right now we have a love affair with mexico because the democrats the democrats wouldn't give us what we needed and i got mexico they're great
 they put up 27000 soldiers on our southern border and the numbers are plummeting 87 down
 the president of mexico is doing a great job
 and we ended catch and release
 you think that was easy
 catch and release you know what catch and release is
 you catch a criminal you take the number and you release him into the they would never come back
 we say come back please in three years this is a democrat deal
 come back if you don't mind in three years
 we release them into our country
 we totally ended it through a very very slick group of rules
 catch and release
 may we please have your address and your phone number
 here it is
 what have you done
 i got out of jail
 oh well welcome to the united states
 please we have a little information
 okay and now we're going to release you and in three and a half years we schedule a court appearance for you
 do you believe this is the only country in the world
 they catch somebody on the border
 you're supposed to be perry mason
 you take them to court
 other countries catch somebody at the border
 they say  sorry you got to get out
 we say oh may we have your information
 we're taking you to court
 man
 today's democrat party glorifies illegal immigration vilifies the heroes of law enforcement and pledges to dissolve immigration control entirely
 they want open borders
 they want hundreds of thousands of people to flow into our country
 and some of those people some of those people are stone cold killers
 some of those people in the caravans right
 i came up with that name but they won't give me credit for that
 they don't give me credit for anything
 they don't give me credit for fake news
 wasn't that my term
 now they say i see cnn they said fake news has reported no no you are fake news that fake news is you
 you are fake news
 they turned the term around
 they are reporting that fake news is reporting their fake news
 left wing politicians even support deadly sanctuary cities that release criminal aliens directly into american communities
 we don't want them
 in new york city the mayor's sanctuary policy recently forced the release of a- â€¦ the mayor's sanctuary policy recently forced the release of a criminal illegal alien charged with assault
 after being set free the same criminal raped brutalized and murdered a 92 year old woman
 they wouldn't give him to the ice warriors
 their warriors
 they're tough and they love our country
 they're very tough and they love our country
 they're taking ms-13 gang members â€¦ they're about as tough as you get they're taking them out of our country by the thousands
 by the thousands
 that's a tough job but they love to do it
 they love our country
 sanctuary city policies aren't just wrong they're immoral and they're lethal and they really are something that has to be stopped
 they have to be stopped now
 what's happening is a disgrace
 thankfully here in iowa your great republican governor sometimes referred to as governor reynolds signed a state-wide ban on sanctuary cities
 thank you kim
 that is why we need to elect more republicans nationwide to end sanctuary cities in all 50 states
 thank you kim reynolds
 you know i endorsed her so i want to take full credit for the job she has done
 i endorsed her very early right
 very early i endorsed her
 i know talent
 she's done a great job
 democrats stand for crime corruption and chaos
 republicans stand for law order and justice
 it's true
 we are finding the illegal game members drug dealers predators and we are throwing them the hell out of our country ideally
 we don't want to put them in prison because you know what
 we got to pay for them for the next 50 years but sometimes we have to
 if they're too dangerous we have no choice
 thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border we have reduced illegal border crossings seven straight months in a row and they're getting lower and lower
 shockingly as that wall gets longer the crossings get less
 remember the democrats
 you don't need a wall
 you don't need a wall
 you don't need it
 seven years they all voted for it they just didn't have the ability to build it
 you know it's not easy with land and this and that and property and rights
 they couldn't figure it out but i can figure it out
 the problem was we couldn't get the money but we got all the money we need now
 we have everything
 we have everything
 the last time this last budget they didn't really fight us on the wall
 you know why
 because they learned it's a really bad issue for them
 it's a really bad issue
 but i made one mistake with the wall
 i should have said we will never ever build a wall
 they would have given me so much money to build a wall
 that was my only â€¦ because i used to go we will build the wall right
 that was a mistake
 i should have said we will never ever build it
 under no circumstances and they would have forced its building and i would have said okay
 by the way in all due respect you know who's going to pay for the wall right
 no no they play â€¦ the fake news plays
 no no through remittance illegal aliens from mexico are going to pay for the call
 that's what it is
 remittance
 100 because when i say something i mean it
 i said i was going to build a wall
 you think it's easy when you have a party that controls the house you got to end that
 you got to end that
 they said they picked up the house in '18 but i didn't run in '18
 you know the big difference when you run '16 i ran '18 i didn't run
 they did they picked up some seats
 i didn't run but i'm running this time and we've got to take back the house
 kevin mccarthy will be a great speaker of the house
 kevin mccarthy will be a great speaker watch
 but getting something built when you have a party that controls one of the three getting it built is â€¦ honestly i don't want to brag nobody else could have done it
 nobody else could have done it
 it's the real deal wall
 it's the wall that border security wanted
 remember i thought i could just build concrete slabs
 they didn't want that because you have to be able to see through
 i said oh come on
 this is the expensive version
 this is the best version
 this is steel and concrete and rebar in between
 it's really something
 did you see the other day where drug dealers got caught at the top
 they couldn't get over
 we had to get the fire department to get them down
 they couldn't get over and they're like mountain climbers
 they got used to climbing
 they got caught because you know that panel
 that's an anti-climb panel
 it's very hot and very tough
 it's a very hard panel to climb the panel on top
 sometimes i'd say i'd rather do without that panel because i'm a very visual person
 they said sir that's anti-climb panel
 i said oh it is
 okay let's put it on
 to hell with it
 it's true
 anti-climb panel
 the wall is the top of the line
 that's what they wanted
 mostly 30 feet tall
 that's very tall
 that's maximum
 it's really doing a big trick
 a lot â€¦ wherever we have it â€¦ 100 miles is all of a sudden a lot but where you have that it's incredible
 99
9 especially when we're watching it
 we're watching the sections
 illegal crossings now are down 75 since last spring
 the powerful border wall was starting to set
 i mean pretty soon we'll be setting records in speed
 it's going up very rapidly
 very rapidly
 you're seeing it all over and it's going to be really something
 look it would be nice if we didn't have to have it
 it would be great but we have to have it
 they said oh we could have drones
 oh what are you going to do with drones flying around
 when people are going through your border with nowhere â€¦ they're going to have drones flying around
 they know because they were all for it
 they were all for it
 now all of a sudden they're against but they want drones
 well we're going to have drones too but the drones are policing the wall
 in terms of human trafficking people don't even talk about it
 because of the internet sadly the worst in the history of our world
 all over the world
 trafficking in women and children all over the world
 all over the world
 the worst it's ever been but when we have this border it makes it very very tough for them to come into the united states with women and with children stuffed in trunks in the back of a car
 the washington democrats have never been more extreme
 132 congressional democrats have signed up for bernie sanders' government healthcare takeover bill
 it's a takeover of your healthcare that would strip all of those 180000 million great americans of your private coverage
 you want that
 you got great deals
 you're able to negotiate you're able to keep your doctor keep your area keep your hospitals keep everything that you wanted
 now they want to take it away
 report to an operating room when you have a cold okay
 in your local hospital
 i don't think so
 180000 million people but i'm not going to knock it because i want bernie to bring it right up to the end and we'll debate it the day before the election
 okay
 we are saving your healthcare while socialist democrats are trying to take away your healthcare
 sleepy joe has no idea what he's even â€¦ he doesn't even know what he's talking about
 he's so lost
 honestly that poor guys is so lost
 they talk healthcare she said it's over for him
 it was over for him actually if you knew him a long time ago
 now it's really over
 we are making healthcare better and cheaper
 we got rid of the individual mandate the most unpopular thing which essentially killed obamacare
 we are protecting people with pre-existing conditions and we always will the republican party
 we're stopping surprise medical billing and making everything totally transparent
 i signed it already
 everything now is going to transparencies where hospitals doctors everybody has to tell you how much things are costing
 watch those prices come down
 right
 right
 i have an expert on healthcare
 he said transparency because it's a big deal
 it's a big deal
 nobody else would have gotten it done that i can tell you
 transparency is bigger than healthcare because you will see prices tumbling like you wouldn't believe
 people go in for a blood test they get charged 2700
 down the road they get the same test for 57
 the same exact test
 maybe it's better
 maybe it's better
 it's crazy
 when you have transparency it's all going to come
 you watch
 you watch
 but this person a real expert said this is bigger than healthcare and i got it done
 unfortunately it won't really start kicking in until after the election because it takes a period of time
 they have certain statutory requirements et cetera
 well you better let me win
 can you imagine
 can you imagine
 i did transparency i took the guts i did transparency and then i'm going to watch as somebody else says didn't he do a great job for transparency
 you better let me win because i want the credit for that one
 we're buying cheaper drugs from other countries and approving more generic drugs than ever ever ever before
 we are defending your right to keep the doctor
 we are defending your right to keep your plan
 remember obama 28 times you can keep your doctor
 you can keep your doctor
 28
 you can also keep your plan
 you can keep it
 you can keep it
 28 times he lied
 we should impeach him
 no he got it on a lie
 he got it on a lie but we've run it much better
 but essentially it's totally different because of individual mandate
 because that really took the guts out of it and we're running it much better
 i had a choice do we run it well or do we run it poorly
 if we run it poorly everyone's going to blame me
 if we run it well everyone's going to give him credit especially the fakers back there right
 but you know what
 we got to run it well but we're coming up with a healthcare that if we win the house we will have the best healthcare of any country in the world by far
 we're fighting the lobbyists and we're fighting the special interest in case you didn't notice
 we are serving only you
 thanks to our bold reforms we're now offering health plans that are 60 cheaper than obamacare
 we're offering a lot of different things
 we have just passed recently 10 months ago right to try
 i love right to try
 you know what that is
 that's people are terminally ill and they can't use medicine because â€¦ they've been trying to pass this almost for 50 years
 you can't use the medicine
 we have the greatest doctors labs hospitals in the world
 they come up with a medicine but it has to go through the fda procedure right
 you can't do anything
 you can't use it
 they won't let you use it
 now i have you sign an agreement you're not going to sue the united states you're not going to this your family et cetera et cetera
 very simple
 and they can use it
 you have no idea the results that are taking place
 you have no idea
 you have no idea the results
 people's lives are being â€¦ for me it was simple
 i said wait a minute you're worried about hurting somebody
 these people are dying
 they're terminally ill
 they're admitting they're terminally ill and you won't let them use a drug that may work
 let the use the drug
 and we're letting them use the drug and it's working in a lot of cases
 we have transformed veterans healthcare including va choice
 the best
 you know i think i'm a totally brilliant human being
 i think i'm the smartest person so i came up with a plan
 i'll never forget i was in new hampshire i came up with this idea because everybody kept coming up to me and saying sir it's really terrible what's happening with healthcare
 we're waiting in line for two weeks for four weeks for seven weeks
 honestly people were waiting in line they weren't very sick they were terminally ill truthfully before they saw a doctor
 by the time they got to the doctor
 so i came up with this incredible plan
 only i could think of this
 i said here's what you do â€¦ here's what you do if somebody can't get a doctor quickly because we have great doctors at the va
 they don't get enough credit
 if you can't get to a doctor quickly you go outside you go locally you get a doctor we pay the bill you get yourself all better
 right
 so i went back
 i went back and i told my people do you have any idea how smart i am
 listen to this plan i have
 they said actually sir we've known about that plan for 52 years we just couldn't get it approved
 so i said oh that's too bad i thought it was brilliant but what i am good at is getting things approved and i got it approved
 people are using it and it's great
 i know the people of iowa don't care about this but we are making substantial investments in rural healthcare
 we are combating the opioid epidemic
 drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 31 years
 that's a great thing
 our great first lady is helping us with that
 that is such a big thing for melania
 big big thing
 she is really involved
 we will never let the democrats give away your healthcare to illegal immigrants especially when we say come in
 come in we'll give you healthcare
 it's one thing they come in and it's a rough situation because we all have hearts but when people are saying like in california this wacky governor he says come in we're going to give you healthcare
 we're going to give you free education
 we're going to give you everything
 we're going to give you a beautiful rolls-royce
 see to show you how fake they are one of the newscasters said donald trump said that the governor of california promised a rolls-royce to illegal immigrants
 he didn't promise them
 this was a lie and a misrepresentation by president trump
 they can't take a little humor
 they can't take it
 these people are sick
 they're sick
 no
 they're sick people
 them and shifty schiff is a very sick person
 he lies awake at night shifting and turning shifty
 shifting and turning in his bed sweating like a dog
 how am i going to get him
 he didn't do anything wrong how am i going to get him
 oh what a sick guy he is
 virtually every top democrat also now supports late-term abortion
 ripping babies straight from the mother's womb
 right up until the moment of birth
 that is why i have asked congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from god
 democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late-term abortion socialism and blatant corruption
 no matter how you cut it that's what it is
 the republican party is the party of the american worker the american family the american dream and the late great abraham lincoln
 you know that right
 abraham lincoln
 honest abe
 remember i always said i can be more presidential than any other past president other than perhaps abraham lincoln when he's wearing the hat right
 because it's easy to be presidential but only have about three people in front of me
 be a good evening ladies and gentlemen
 is everything okay in iowa
 oh i see the world is ripping you off
 well there's not a thing i can do about that
 thank you
 good night everybody
 good night
 no we got to do it the right way
 republicans â€¦ and by the way can i be honest
 doing this takes far more talent than doing that
 doing that is very easy
 this is not easy
 especially when you just left michigan and you just left other places and you got maniacs doing a number on you all the time for three years
 you got the maniacs for three years
 i think before i came down the escalator with our future first lady i think really they were doing it then
 they started even before i came down on the escalator
 these people are maniacs so you have all that
 so you're fighting that and you're doing farm bills
 we got your farm bill approved by the way
 we got your farm bill approved
 i don't even mention that because that's massive by any other standard but it's peanuts compared to the usmca and the china deal right
 so i don't even mention it
 anyway republicans are fighting for citizens from every background and from every race religion color and creed
 it's true
 our numbers with african american workers people are through the roof
 are through the roof because â€¦ remember i used to say what do you have to lose
 i'd read the down the worst on crime the worst on education
 they got this they got that they got 10 different things all horrible
 one day i'm in front of this tremendous group of people and i'm reading this list african american they have the highest crime rate they have the highest this they have the worst education they have the worst schools they have the worst â€¦ i said stay with me because they were with the democrats for a hundred years more
 i said stay with me
 what the hell do you have to lose
 you know what
 you know what
 remember that
 now they have the best employment and unemployment numbers they have the best poverty numbers they have numbers that nobody would believe
 they're doing so great
 it's so great to see it
 it's incredible
 youth unemployment african american youth
 it's been great
 we're asking all americans to join our incredible movement
 we are a big tent and a big party with big bold beautiful ideas for the future
 we're what the country was based on originally
 it was called greatness
 it was called greatness
 during national school choice week school choice everybody we continue our fight to rescue children trapped in failing government schools
 iowa became one of the first states to pass school choice
 that was over 10 years ago
 now governor reynolds senator ernst senator grassley and more than 100 members of congress are supporting our plan to give school choice to every child in america who needs it
 it's a great plan
 to give former prisoners a second chance at life we passed criminal justice reform
 think of that
 think of that
 we had a lot of great conservatives who wanted it we had liberals who wanted it
 they couldn't get it passed
 president obama couldn't even come close
 he didn't try too hard
 he talked like oh i'll try
 to uphold the rule of law we have confirmed 191 federal judges a record who will interpret the constitution as one
 and two great supreme court justices by the way
 as part as â€¦ right
 two great ones
 as part of my commitment to rebuild our military we secured an 8
5 million facility to support our iowa guardsmen at camp dodge right here in des moines iowa
 right here camp dodge
 camp dodge everybody
 we take care of camp dodge
 i recognized israel's true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem
 we recognized israeli sovereignty over the golan heights
 yesterday we just released a historic new plan for peace
 we're going to see if we can get that done
 it's one of the toughest deals of all
 one of the toughest deals but we have a shot at it
 for years you watched as your politicians apologized for our country
 they apologized
 they would say i'm sorry
 now you have a president who is standing up for america and we are standing up for the great people of iowa
 we are standing up for iowa
 at stake in our present battle is the survival frankly of our nation
 look i can make this speech really short
 all i have to do is say hello iowa you have no choice
 you have to vote for me
 otherwise everything that you've built in your entire life will be gone
 goodbye iowa have a good time
 instead i work my ass off up here okay
 yeah
 true
 do you think this is easy
 it's a little hot in this room
 this room wasn't designed for this many people
 if you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of americans have fought and died for then we must devote everything we have toward victory in november of 2020
 we have to
 by the way for those beautiful farmers that want to leave your small farms or businesses to your children â€¦ because of our great tax bill the biggest tax cut in the history of our country the biggest that you benefit by
 because of that there is no death tax or inheritance tax as they call it
 so i always say if you love your children that's a great thing
 if you don't love your children don't leave it to them and that particular tax won't matter but if you love â€¦ is there anybody here that does not love your children
 is there anybody here who loves your children
 well it's iowa
 it's iowa
 you love your children
 you know you have no tax to pay you leave your 


 no it's great
 so when you're looking down at your children you're saying oh did you get lucky
 did you get lucky
 look at them they're enjoying life
 but only this way can we save the america we love and drain the washington swamp once and for all
 that swamp is bad
 that swamp is bad
 i had no idea it was going to be this sick and this degenerated
 it's a degenerate swamp
 i had no idea
 when i came out i said we're going to drain this swamp
 i had no idea that the swamp was that evil but we're winning
 we're winning because we're in the white house
 we're winning
 with your help we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work dependents to independents and poverty to prosperity
 that's what's happening all over our country
 together we will elect a republican congress to create a fair safe sane and lawful system of immigration
 it's already happening
 we will continue to enact new trade deals that result in more products made raised farmed and grown right here in the usa
 we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine
 finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the aids epidemic in america in less than 10 years
 we've already started
 should have been started in the last administration
 incredible
 should have been started earlier but we started
 in less than 10 years the aids epidemic will be eradicated will be gone
 who would have thought that was possible
 when they came in and told me that a couple of years ago i said really
 nobody knows that
 incredible the strides that we've made
 we will defend privacy free speech religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms
 in the state of virginia they want to take your guns away you believe it
 virginia i love virginia
 of all states they want to take your guns away
 the democrats
 not going to happen
 above all we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one america
 we are one great america
 we support protect and defend the constitution of the united states
 we stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement
 we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life
 we believe that family and faith not government bureaucracy are the true american way not government bureaucracy
 we believe that children should be taught to love our country honor our history and to always respect our great american flag
 and we live by the words of our national motto in god we trust
 we live by those words in god we trust
