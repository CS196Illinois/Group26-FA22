thank you thank you
 wow
 wow and i'm thrilled to be here with you in henderson
 thousands of loyal hard-working great american patriots
 and 51 days from now we're going to win nevada and we're going to win four more years in the white house
 and after we win four more years we'll ask for maybe another four or so
 well thank you very much
 whenever i say that … look at all that news back there look at all that fake news
 when i say that their heads explode
 our movement is pro-jobs pro-worker pro-police and 100 pro-american
 as we begin tonight our thoughts are with the two sheriff's deputies in los angeles who were fighting for their lives when a vicious criminal walked up to their vehicle and shot them at point blank range
 tonight we send our love and our support to their families and we pray to god for their recovery
 the radical left in america is waging open war on law enforcement
 hundreds of officers nationwide have been injured in left-wing riots and mobs
 you see it you see it all the time
 please sit down
 please let's have a little fun
 we got plenty of time
 i mean here it is
 i mean what do we have
 football is boring as hell
 it's just not the same
 right
 i don't know
 used to be people would say hey could you keep it away from a football game
 now they're saying could you possibly do it during the football game
 we have some free time
 but during violent demonstrations in las vegas a 29-year-old police officer you know this very well was deliberately shot in the head leaving the young brave officer paralyzed yet sleepy joe biden and his supporters continue their dangerous war on the police
 they're putting the lives of our brave officers directly in harm's way
 at his convention he never even mentioned the words law and order never mentioned them once
 now he's all of a sudden his polls are dropping like a rock and he's starting to say but we need law and order
 and then he goes back into the basement for four days
 what happens to this guy
 i know what happens to him
 he's shot
 that's what happened to him
 every once in a while the great dana white … does anybody know dana white
 he's got some champions with him tonight
 he's here
 i got to introduce him
 but every once in a while i'll ask him what happened to that guy
 he said sir he's been shot for the last … long time
 should have left a long time ago
 that's joe biden
 joe biden he's shot and everybody knows it
 and you know what
 they ought to be ashamed because they do interviews with him they give him the questions and they let him read the answer from a teleprompter and that's the fake news
 it is
 how about the other day
 could you move that a little bit closer
 see these things
 move it a little bit
 i must tell you at great peril i used them seldom but those are the times we have the best fun too i will say
 and that's actually when we learn the most
 for the entire summer biden was silent as left-wing mobs assaulted police officers
 when biden's far-left supporters set fire to police cars and precinct stations court houses joe biden called them peaceful protestors
 right
 they call them peaceful protestors
 and when we go to these radical-left place that are having problems because everyone … look at the top-10
 you go back … go top-20 top-30
 take a look
 democrat-run radical left-wing democrat usually run
 not republican-run democrat-run
 and we go back and we take a look
 we want to give them help
 they don't want help
 but when they do ask for help and when they do we go in
 like minneapolis the national guard went in took 35 minutes to quell a situation that went on for two weeks
 they knew we were going in to seattle
 we told them we're going in tomorrow morning
 and so they sent them in
 they didn't want that to happen and we let the protestors know or whatever you call them
 they're really anarchists they're not protestors
 so we let the anarchists know that we were going in with approximately 10000 very tough people and they immediately raised their hands and the seattle police who by the way could do a great job if they were let to do their job but they're not they're not
 and as you know in portland the other day we had to send in the us marshalls
 a man who's a bad guy bad guy shot somebody right in the middle of the street who they say was a very fine young man
 shot him killed him
 just shot him like … it was on television
 two-and-a-half days nothing happened
 i said what's going on
 we sent in the us marshalls
 it was taken care of in 15 minutes
 okay
 15 minutes
 when asked if he would cut police funding sleepy joe said absolutely yes i would
 now he's trying to change his mind
 you ever see a guy … he changed his mind on fracking
 okay
 there will be no fracking
 you know that
 he went all throughout the debates
 he doesn't even know what fracking is i guarantee you
 he was told to say that by bernie and the radical left and his vice president
 by the way how bad is she
 she is the worst
 we're going to have a woman president some day
 not going to be her not going to be her
 and that's no way to attain the office
 we got in there because sleepy joe couldn't handle it anymore
 joe is bad primetime
 see the reason i can talk so badly about him because he did an ad where he had me standing over the grave and the graves of our fallen heroes from many years ago and they said … and nobody loves the military more
 look what i've done for them 2
5 trillion
 and in the ad they have me saying horrible things in front of other people
 nobody would have put up with that
 it's called disinformation
 they make up a total lie they put it out then they do ads
 so once he did that i said now really look it's okay
 it's okay because now the gloves are off
 i can say that this man is totally unfit to be president
 up here he's totally unfit
 he can't be your president
 i've gotten to know president xi of china
 i've gotten to know president putin of russia
 and by the way getting along with them is good
 although china i must tell you got a real problem with china
 what they did with us we can never forget that
 we made a great trade deal
 the ink wasn't dry when the plague came in from china
 they stopped it from going into china but they didn't stop it from going into our country europe and the rest of the world
 okay
 they could have done that
 but you see i deal with all of these people and they don't have the kind of mental problem that sleepy joe has
 they're very sharp
 kim jong-un
 kim jong-un doesn't know about the problems that joe has
 we need very sharp people
 i'm sorry
 joe is not qualified for this position
 joe calls for abolishing cash bail and closing your prisons
 he wants to close prisons and he even called law enforcement the enemy recently
 you saw that
 the enemy until his polls started dropping
 then all of a sudden he said no we love law enforcement
 i think i've gotten every major law enforcement group in the country right
 you saw recently i got new york's finest
 and they are new york's finest but they're not allowed to do their job
 they're not allowed
 we have a radical left mayor who has no clue
 he has no clue what's happening to that poor city
 i love that city
 what's happening to that city
 300 up
 look 300 in certain very bad crimes new york
 there's no reason for this and we have the greatest police
 they're great
 new york's finest they endorsed me
 chicago fraternal order of police
 chicago endorsed me oklahoma endorsed me texas endorsed me florida endorsed me
 every place endorsed me
 and if you think it's easy for new york and chicago and these different places … ohio endorsed me
 if you think it's easy for these guys
 they never endorse
 new york they said they cannot remember ever having endorsed a presidential candidate
 they endorsed me and they're against their radical left culture that's destroying the city
 so i was very honored
 but how about chicago
 do you think it's easy for these great police in chicago to endorse me
 it's not easy but they felt that they had an obligation to do it
 so it just happened
 i'm just very honored by it
 and biden's anti-police crusade must stop
 it's got to stop it's got to stop now
 furthermore the corporations these poor stupid people that run the … they got paid a lot of money
 they're weak ineffective people let's face it
 they're funding anti-police organizations and other organizations that are … it's so embarrassing
 and i don't mean for a little
 they gave 100 million and 250 … you're talking about serious money
 you're talking about serious money and that money is not used for good reasons
 and these stupid corporations … and they'll be the first to go if the radical left ever took … they'd throw those guys out like they were nothing
 if they were lucky they'd just be thrown out
 it would probably be a lot rougher than that
 these people don't know what they're getting into
 but instead of giving money they should give money to the families of the crime victims and the fallen officers
 that's what they should do
 so in the republican party we know that police officers are not villains but the heroes who risk their lives to keep us safe
 and they guard … the thing that's incredible … i know so many police they're so good one bad apple and they're on for months
 one bad apple they go on for months
 the thousands and tens of thousands of good things nobody talks about it
 these are great people that have done a great job and we have to support our law enforcement
 so biden wants to appease the domestic terrorists and my plan is to arrest domestic terrorists
 okay
 and we also believe that if you murder a police officer you should receive the death penalty and that's something that's very important fine people
 i mean they're in very grave condition as you know
 fine people
 he's an animal and i called him an animal and i was criticized by people calling him an animal
 they said he's a human being
 he's not a human being
 he's an animal
 he's not a human being
 joe biden opposes the death penalty even for cops who … i mean look you have to see even for these cop killers who go around the predators they murder children
 people like the boston bomber
 he opposes the death penalty for the boston bomber
 he wants to give prisoners a vote
 he wants to have the boston bomber be able to vote
 i don't think so
 i don't think so
 i don't think so
 you know who's thought of that
 bernie sanders crazy bernie
 he wants to have … crazy bernie he says no no they have to vote
 so they asked him well does that mean every …  that means everybody that's in prisons should be entitled to a vote right
 so they actually said well what about the boston bomber
 should he entitled
 and bernie goes yeah he should be entitled
 bernie is crazy
 but the fact is that we got a lot of bernie votes four years ago because bernie's right about one thing trade
 because all of these countries friend and foe they ripoff the united states
 we have made so many great trade deals and you see it usmca
 we got rid of nafta
 so many
 but biden is too weak to be president and he's not a smart person
 and by the way he wasn't smart 25 years ago
 everybody knew it
 now we don't even have to discuss the matter
 but i was going to say when he put that ad up we told him to take it down
 when he put that ad up that dishonored our fallen heroes
 they are great great heroes of mine of yours of everybody's
 i know really bad people
 no bad person the worst person i know i know some beauties from new york
 i know some developers in new york actually
 nobody would say what they said
 they made it up
 it was a made up statement and they put it up in the form an ad from a third-rate magazine who's best friend is obama who by the way got caught spying on my campaign
 he got caught
 we caught him cold
 we have him cold
 now let's see what happens
 now the republicans it's interesting we have much better policy but the republicans they don't fight like colby
 you know who colby is
 you're going to say hello to colby
 they don't fight like colby
 they don't fight to win
 better policy but they don't have that vicious streak
 if this were reversed they would be in jail for two years already and it would be for a 50-year term for treason
 that's what it would be
 okay
 but biden's too scared to stand up to the crazy socialists and never will
 he'll never have the strength and he's going downhill fast
 it's going to be very interesting
 and i called for a drug test because you know what
 i want a drug test because we don't want to have a situation like we could have with this guy
 i watched him in debates with other 24 lunatics and he was so bad
 no he was so bad
 maybe he'll win because they don't like me they don't like my personality
 but i hate to say it i'm what you need
 i'm what you need
 we love you
 we love you
 we love you
 we love you
 we love you
 we love you
 we love you
 but if biden ever did win he would surrender your country to the mob
 you know that
 and he will have nothing to do with it
 it's not him
 i mean he's being … he's going to be pushed around
 and she's by the way just so you know what you're going to get
 she's considered far more liberal than bernie sanders
 how about that
 that's what you're going to have
 i don't think your state is into that
 unlike biden i'll always stand with the heroes of law enforcement
 and i'm deeply honored to have gotten all of those endorsements
 that to me is a really big deal
 that to me is really a big deal
 and i just want to thank all of them including the national troopers association and coalition just came in
 we also received the endorsement total and complete endorsement from the public safety alliance of nevada and the las vegas police protective association from nevada
 and i want to thank for that steve grammar who's with us tonight
 where's steve
 was steve here
 steve thank you
 thank you
 that's a big deal
 make sure they get out and vote steve because they're playing around with the ballots
 okay
 you know your governor
 so we had many sites by the way all exterior sites all outside
 today you'll hear these phoneys back there
 well look at that
 now today you're going to hear them
 they'll say oh it was in … well the reason it was we had five sites all outside sites like last night
 tremendous room
 and a great gentleman who owns this building said you know what
 what they're doing is really unfair
 you can use my building don
 i want to thank you don
 i want to thank you
 this is the most important election in the history of our country
 at no time before has there been a clearer choice between two parties two visions two philosophies two agendas for the future
 joe biden has spent the last 47 years selling out america
 look at what he's done
 everything he's done was wrong
 he always voted the wrong way
 even his secretary of defense his secretary of state they said he always voted the wrong way
 he was off shoring your jobs throwing open your borders depleting our military and sacrificing your children's future to china and other faraway lands
 i've spent the last four … he says … only in nevada can you have … i would never say it
 what did you say
 okay
 this way i can't get in trouble
 i've spent the last four years bringing our jobs back to america securing our borders rebuilding our military and standing up to china like no other president has ever done
 if biden wins china wins
 if biden wins the mob wins
 if biden wins the rioters and anarchists and … look you see what's going on
 the arsonists and flag burners
 how about the flag burning
 i would love- i would love to have a law … this is so sad what's going on
 when i see the american flag burn i get so angry
 i get so angry
 i would love to have a law
 it has to go through a big process
 you burn the flag you go to jail for one year
 i would love to see it
 i would love to see it
 i would love to see it
 i would love to see it
 if i were a congressman or senator i'd be in there with that one
 you know they'll say oh freedom of speech
 that's not freedom of speech
 you burn the flag you should go to jail for one year
 i really mean that
 they'll say oh it's horrible
 he's against free speech
 no no we're not
 we're not against free speech
 but i'm running for reelection to bring back the tremendous prosperity that we enjoyed before the plague came in and it's happening very fast
 and i'm running for your state
 i love this state
 you know i put a lot of money in this state and it's been a great investment
 and we want to keep this state strong
 not for that reason by the way for other reasons because this is a great place
 you have a governor right now who's a political hack
 we want to put violent criminals behind bars
 and tell you governor to open up your state by the way
 open up your state
 you know just so you know these shutdowns we did the right thing
 we had the greatest economy in the history of the world
 they came in they … we were all seeing what was happening
 we closed up
 i mean you know you're presiding over the greatest economy in history and a group of very smart people walk in and say sir we have to close it
 and we did the right thing
 we closed it
 well actually he didn't think we should close it yet
 but later on he said we did the right thing
 we closed it
 we closed it
 we saved millions of lives
 if we wouldn't have closed it we would've been talking two and a half or three million
 we're at 180
 it's far too much
 but we would have been talking about … it would've been unacceptable unsustainable
 it would've been so bad
 think of it
 we're at 180000
 other countries are doing terribly
 did you see the statistics of us compared to other countries
 us compared to europe
 we have done an incredible job
 we get absolutely no credit for the job we've done
 and i don't want it myself but i want it for the admirals and the generals and mike pence
 and joe biden was against it
 remember
 he was totally against closing
 he said oh he's xenophobic
 i'm xenophobic
 i wanted it closed and nobody else did
 at that time nobody else did
 i was way early
 you know they say he didn't act fast
 i was months early
 nancy pelosi was a month and a half later saying come to chinatown
 let's come to chinatown
 and sleepy joe was totally … he thought what i was doing was terrible
 then all of a sudden now i see him saying he should have closed it earlier
 this guy … you know the great thing about the age in which we live
 it's all down in tape
 it's all down
 i got a reel on him
 we call it biden's best
 you got to hear this
 but we want to ensure the future of america not the future of china and other countries because if we win america wins and it's all about america first
 you've had presidents they never put america first
 they didn't put america first
 they didn't take care of our country but we're taking care of our country
 now joe biden cannot lead our country because he really doesn't believe truly in our country
 but i think that's a very strong statement
 i don't think he has a clue
 i'll be honest
 the people that push him around don't believe in our country because he agreed to a manifesto with crazy bernie right
 it's called the manifesto
 you know why it's called the manifesto
 because this is beyond socialism
 this is a word that starts with a c not and s
 that's where they're coming from
 that's where they're coming from
 at biden's convention they decried america wicked
 and they were saying it's wicked sinful
 it's destined for a fate of doom and despair
 that was by the way that was the most depressing convention
 we had a great convention
 we had a great convention
 they actually said that america wasn't great
 they actually said that america was never great
 you know who said that
 cuomo the governor of new york said america wasn't great
 i don't know if he's going to get away with that one
 that's going to haunt him
 that's going to haunt him
 america wasn't great
 him and his brother fredo
 you ever watch fredo
 his ratings aren't very good so you probably don't
 but we know the truth
 america's the most exceptional nation on earth
 and our destiny is blessed by god
 we love this nation with all of our heart and soul and we will always take care of our nation
 you know we have a little expression make america great again
 that's what's happened
 and you know we had it done
 now i say make america great again again
 comma
 i go comma again
 and that's what we're doing at a record clip
 they've never had a clip like this with the jobs and everything else
 you see the numbers
 on november 3rd nevada will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity and we're doing it
 we're going to have a tremendous year next year
 or whether we'll allow joe biden and the group of handlers to impose a 4 trillion tax hike ban american energy destroy our suburbs demolish our second amendment and indoctrinate your children with a poisonous anti-american lie
 yeah
 get him out of here would you please
 under my leadership we built the greatest economy in the world
 he's going home to mom
 and now we're doing it again
 we're developing a vaccine in record time
 the other administration would have been years and we're almost there
 it's going to be announced very soon
 we'll be ready before the end of the year
 and we will very easily defeat the china virus
 that's what's happening
 and we're already making that turn
 we're making that round beautiful last turn but it should have never happened
 china should have never let that happen
 they should have stopped it in china
 under my administration before the virus we quickly achieved the lowest unemployment rate in nevada's history
 and we'll soon be there again
 you see what's happening
 a guy like biden would totally eradicate nevada's economy
 he would make it impossible for you to compete
 and he's already said if the doctor suggested he would shut down the country again
 we're not shutting down our country
 a shutdown we'll destroy the lives and dreams of tens of millions of american
 look the americans you know on the other side if you look at these shutdowns and you're living through it right now
 you know there aren't many states that are shut down
 they're all democrats
 north carolina your state
 but north carolina we're not … you take a look at north carolina
 pennsylvania shut down
 every one of them that are shut down are doing not well
 they're not doing well
 and they all have democrat governors
 and you know when you look at the suicide rates when you look at all of the suicide all of the domestic violence the drugs all of the problems we can't have it
 we can't have it
 open up your state
 you got to open up your state
 it's all political
 it's all political
 it's all political
 on november 4th they'll announce we're going to open up the states
 they're only doing it to affect your november 3rd great election
 most important election
 biden will always do whatever the radical left demands
 and if elected his radical supporters won't just be causing mayhem on the streets
 they'll be running the department of justice the department of homeland security
 and by the way the united states supreme court
 and we will have a very different country
 you know the next president probably will have anywhere one two three or four supreme court justices
 if you want your second amendment if you want life if you want so many other things even having to do with your military even having to do with your vets if you want things if you want you've got to have the court
 because they'll last for 25 30 40 years
 they're put on as young people and they stay a long time
 our country will never be the same
 we'll never be able to recover from it
 so you got to get out on november 3rd or early voting
 you got to get out and vote
 and you could send your ballot and then you have to check that your ballot's counted because they might not count your ballot in this state
 they may not count your ballot
 but we're looking to save and we're going to save america
 we're not going to let that happen
 so we're joined tonight by two terrific congressional candidates that have been just incredible in the job they've done
 you see it
 i mean you've seen it all the way
 the job they've done in their campaign
 they beat people that were very good very talented great politicians and they won
 dan where is he
 dan rodimer
 dan rodimer
 dan rodimer
 and we're with you all the way dan
 and jim marchant
 jim thank you very much
 thank you jim
 so we're backing you all the way
 you got to get them in
 we will take back the house
 you know why
 because people cannot stand nancy pelosi
 they don't like nancy pelosi
 even the woman that owns the beauty parlor turned her in
 can you believe that
 nancy pelosi's a customer
 she turned her in
 she thought it was disgraceful but that's what we're dealing with a bunch of phonies
 but you guys we have your back 100
 michael you'll make sure all right
 i also want to introduce and thank … he's done a fantastic job
 nevada republican party chairman michael mcdonald

 thank you rick
 thank you don
 thank you don
 also a las vegas legend rick harrison
 rick thank you rick
 you are a legend aren't you huh
 great job you've done
 great job you've done
 a friend of mine for a long time
 years ago he was looking for a place
 can i tell this story just quickly do you mind
 he was looking for a place and they said well that sport's never going to make it
 it's too violent
 they just don't know how violent the american people are do they
 they never quite figured that out
 no
 they said no it'll never make it
 there's nobody like this guy i'm telling you
 i always say it's a great sport
 without him i don't know what they'd do
 i don't know if anything would make it… he could do anything
 he is so smart so tough so cunning
 he's been a friend of mine for a long time i've been a friend of his but i gave him a place a long time ago
 and all i know is just like we have outside we had lines
 i said what the hell is going on here dana
 this place is packed
 we were packed
 we had thousands of people that couldn't get in and i was so nice
 i said let's do it again dana please
 and we did it again and again and again and it became the ufc and he sold it and has a big chunk of it but he got 4 billion when he sold it
 4 billion
 that's not too bad
 that's not too bad dana
 but he really is he's an incredible guy
 and he also loves his fighters
 he wants to take care of his fighters and he brought some of them along the best
 but i want to introduce dana white
 dana please stand up
 and dana brought along a few of his friends and these are not people you want to pick a fight with
 because under those beautiful suits there are a lot of muscles a lot of power a lot of genius for fighting and for other things but a lot of genius under those suits
 a few members of the ufc community
 here's a man he used to walk into that ring and he still does and he's as good as there is in the world
 number one in the world
 you don't want to pick a fight with him at a bar
 let's say you'd had a fight and you happen to meet colby covington
 you say what's your name
 and he said my name's colby covington
 and the first time i saw colby covington he walks into the ring
 now he wasn't fighting but he walked in with that same hat that you're wearing
 it said keep america great
 it says make… he doesn't care
 as long as it has trump on in someplace he doesn't care
 he doesn't discriminate
 but this was the same day that we had our conservative reporter beat to hell by that wise guy who's now in big trouble for doing what he did
 and then he walks in wearing the hat keep america great
 and he wears the hat and he's going like this because this was a big story
 you remember what they did to that guy
 conservative reporter not a fighter
 he wasn't a fighter
 and it was 10 people against one
 now if we had 10 people against that one those 10 people would be in serious trouble
 they said what the hell
 but i'd like to introduce colby covington
 great fighter
 great great fighter
 incredible
 he is a great fighter
 three months ago i saw him fight a guy
 he looked like it would be impossible to beat
 i never saw muscles
 he had muscles on muscles on muscles
 and colby is a very fit guy and fantastic
 but he didn't look quite the same
 it wasn't even a contest
 it went a few rounds
 i couldn't believe what you did
 he took him apart so easily
 it was like an easy day at the office
 so you have to explain that to me someday colby but we love you man
 you're with us and where we are with you
 another great great champion
 another great champion henry cejudo one of the best in the world
 and henry please stand please
 now you won the championship twice right henry
 twice
 he won it twice
 don't mess with him
 don't mess with him
 and his brother alonzo is here
 alonzo cruz
 thank you very much alonzo
 thank you
 thank you
 and alonzo doesn't mess with henry he learned that a long time ago
 so one of the best fighters in the world and he's got a tremendous fight coming up against i guess the number one rated pound for pound fighter justin gaethje
 please stand up justin
 justin gaethje thank you
 and you feel good about that fight
 he said he's going to knock him out
 well we're going to be watching
 it's right before the election but i think i'm going to be watching okay
 i'll be watching you better believe it
 that's going to be an incredible fight
 good luck
 good luck justin
 great fighter
 and also ali abdelaziz right
 abdelaziz
 great guy
 one of the best
 thank you very much
 but these are great people that they have so many people at the ufc and they've been big fans of us
 they love our country
 they love our country
 and we loved them and nobody like our dana
 thank you dana very much
 great honor
 thank you man
 tonight we're also praying for everyone throughout the west affected by the devastating wildfires
 we want really forest management we want forest management… my administration is closely coordinating with the state and local leaders with the governor and we thank the more than 28000 firefighters and first responders courageously braving the danger and their life and i'm going there tomorrow
 i'll be going to california tomorrow
 we have meetings with fema and all of the different people
 it'll be amazing to see
 it's like the biggest we've ever had
 it's crazy
 it's crazy what's going on
 thousands and thousands and thousands of acres
 it's crazy
 so we're going to be there tomorrow
 we'll be with the governor
 we're also going to various other places
 washington also is in big trouble and oregon
 i spoke with the governor of oregon and they've never had anything like it
 and of course they also have a place called portland and we will put that fire out
 just tell us to put it out governor
 that fire we'll put out
 that's a much easier fire to put out
 it would take us less than a half an hour
 we've spent the last four years reversing the damage done by joe biden and all of the damage that him and his thought process has inflicted over a 47-year period
 we passed record-setting tax cuts and record-setting regulation cuts
 we achieved american energy independence
 nobody thought it was possible
 when biden pledged to abolish the production of american oil and shale and clean coal and natural gas which is very clean and he wanted to ban fracking we said no we're not doing that
 for 47 years biden crushed the dreams of american workers to enrich foreign countries
 that's what happened
 look he says he's going to change
 he's been there for 47 years and you know that he's been there until three and a half years ago
 so it's not like gee he hasn't done it for 20
 he was there recently
 they didn't do it
 and you don't change
 and you always go back to the first statement
 his first statement was anti- religion
 his first statement was anti-fracking anti-energy
 his first statement was anti all of the things but it was really anti-gun anti-second amendment
 he even put this whack job he even put beto o'rourke beto
 great deal for us
 that's a great deal
 by the way our stock market is setting records i hate to say in the middle a pandemic
 but hopefully as we round that final turn on the pandemic we're setting records with the stock market
 your 401k's are doing very well
 your stocks are doing very well
 and you know what
 if something would happen where he'd get in and there's a headwind believe it or not that stock market would be much higher but there's a headwind on the possibility okay
 everything is a possibility
 there's a headwind
 but i'll tell you what if he ever got in you would have a market crash the likes of which this country has never seen before
 just remember it just to remember it because what they want to do is crazy the green new deal 100 trillion the green new deal
 that's more money than we could make in a thousand years a hundred trillion dollars
 we don't like that building
 the windows are too big
 what do you do
 rip it down and build a new one
 all good
 that sounds good
 i saved the u
s
 auto industry by withdrawing from the last administration's job-killing catastrophe the trans-pacific partnership
 and we're building many auto plants you know that some here but we're building many auto plants in michigan many auto plants in michigan
 if we don't win michigan after all those auto plants and i don't know but it's been tough but we won it last time
 and we're showing a poll that just came out that we're two points up in michigan
 that's very good that's very good
 i took the toughest ever action to stand up to china's rapid theft of american jobs
 biden's agenda is made in china my agenda is made in the usa
 that's what it is
 for the last four years i've been delivering for our incredible hispanic community i'm fighting for school choice safe neighborhoods low taxes low regulations on all hispanic-owned small business and they are great business people
 and they understood that
 they understood that they understood it… and by the way there's nobody that knows our southern border better than i call them the hispanics i call them the latino
 i said what do you prefer
 it's very interesting
 some say call us latino
 others say call us hispanic
 others say call us whatever the hell you want
 we love you we love you
 but our hispanic population knows our southern border better than anybody else
 and they don't want criminals coming across
 they want people to come across but they want them to come across legally
 and we have the strongest southern border now that we've ever had
 the democrats and biden would be a disaster for hispanic americans
 he's pledged to wage attacks on catholic organizations like the little sisters of the poor
 they're fighting him
 he supports taxpayer-funded extreme late-term abortion
 extreme late-term
 he would allow left-wing anarchies to burn down your businesses
 he would hand over your jobs to china and your country to the socialists and beyond the socialists
 the democrat party also continues to attack our incredible border agents more than half of whom happen to be hispanic americans
 and they're great
 and i want to thank not only law enforcement but a big part of law enforcement the border patrol and the ice agents they're incredible
 the ice agents dana could sign some of them up the ice agents they go into like a pack
 they go at a pack
 they go into a pack of ms-13 fighters
 these are criminals and they do it like it's routine
 you don't want that job
 i don't see any of the people male or female sitting in this audience that wants that job ice
 they take out thousands and thousands of ms-13 killers a year and bring them the hell back out of our country
 all around our country our communities are protected by hispanic american heroes in law enforcement and they deserve unwavering gratitude
 i want to just thank you all i want to thank you all
 with us tonight are members of the national border patrol council and they are great friends of us
 i want to just thank them
 the official union of our nation's incredible border patrol agents
 and you know what
 they're not supposed to do it but they did it anyway they endorsed me
 i want to thank brandon judd who's here and art del cueto
 art
 where's brandon where is my brandon
 where is brandon
 look at these guys
 look they're ready
 they're ready to fight
 hey brandon art pick out your toughest guy i want to see whether or not he can take colby in a fight
 don't do it
 thank you very much
 thanks fellas
 we appreciate it very much
 thanks
 great job too
 great job
 my administration has achieved the most secure border in american history
 we ended catch and release
 we stopped asylum fraud
 we've deported 20000 gang members and over half a million criminal aliens
 we built over 320 miles as of today border wall and we're adding 10 new miles every single week
 we're doing about 10 miles a week and we'll be finished with the wall very shortly
 and you think that was an easy one
 that was not an easy one
 we were fought
 two things and i say it two things that never get old
 remember the democrats are saying a wall won't work
 really
 tell me about it
 wall works
 that's one of the reasons our numbers are so good but two things that will never get old- … one of the reasons our numbers are so good but two things that will never get old never you know what they are
 a wall and a wheel
 a wall and a wheel
 it'll never get old
 a wall
 i see so many things and i see all these businesses computers you come up with a new chip you come up with a new computer you come up with a new laptop
 three weeks later you buy it three weeks later it's obsolete
 but a wall will never be obsolete and a wheel will never be obsolete
 you come back in a thousand years a wall and a wheel
 thanks to our powerful new security measures we've doubled the amount of meth seized at the border over the last year we've doubled
 we invested 2
5 trillion in the us military and launched the first new branch of the us armed forces in 75 years the space force
 we passed va choice and va accountability
 and i've accomplished more in 47 months than joe biden did in 47 years
 that's true
 that's true
 i withdrew from the last administration's disastrous iran nuclear deal
 so good for israel
 so good that we did that
 they paid 150 billion 1
8 billion in cash
 i think dana white could have made a slightly better deal than that
 you know what we got for it
 nothing
 we got nothing
 we killed the founder and leader of isis
 al-baghdadi we eliminated the number one terrorist in the world
 and we're talking over a 50 year period
 number one in the world the mass murder of american troops and many other people throughout the world qasem soleimani is dead
 i kept my promise recognized the true capital of israel and opened the american embassy in jerusalem
 i recognized israeli sovereignty over the golan heights and we've achieved the two historic peace deals in the middle east in just the last month two two
 over 75 years they did two
 we did two in a month
 and many other countries are coming in the united arab emirates and bahrain have both agreed to normalize relations with israel
 nobody thought this was possible
 in fact you didn't hear it because they don't report this
 they just don't want to report it but they nominated your president twice last week on two different subjects for a nobel prize
 but the fake news media didn't cover it so that's it
 biden got it
 remember… well okay
 remember when our great president right
 barack hussein obama he got it
 right
 like immediately
 and they said why did you get it
 and he was unable to explain do you remember
 why did you get it
 because it was like he just became president and they said we're going to nominate barack hussein obama for the nobel peace award right
 and what happened
 and then biden said what about me
 they said who the hell is he
 this guy what the hell has he done
 but it's true
 obama got it for no reason whatsoever
 rick you know that
 no reason whatsoever
 joe biden brought you only endless wars i'm bringing you peace and i'm bringing our troops back home
 they're all coming back
 endless wars
 biden voted for the iraq war
 he opposed the mission to take out osama bin laden
 he opposed the killing of soleimani
 he oversaw the rise of isis and he cheered the rise of china as a positive development for america and the world
 when i banned china from coming in highly infected he said it was hysterical and xenophobic
 if we had listened to joe hundreds of thousands more americans would have died just by that one move alone
 when the- thank you
 i agree actually but i don't think i'm allowed to say it
 when the virus arrived we launched the largest national mobilization since world war ii we're delivering life-saving therapies we've achieved among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country anywhere in the world
 you don't hear this
 europe's excess mortality rate is 24 higher than the us and despite their very punitive lockdowns they're once again seeing very large spikes in cases unfortunately
 the united states has experienced the smallest contraction of any major western nation and the fastest recovery by far
 who's going to do well
 and there's a reason for it
 through our historic relief programs we've saved more than half a million nevada jobs and over 42000 nevada businesses we've saved 42000 of your businesses
 and he's looking at doing all of this stuff
 he will destroy protections for preexisting conditions and decimate your 401s your retirement system your stocks he'll establish a national sanctuary city policy for criminal illegal aliens
 he wants to cut your vet facilities in half go to socialized healthcare and end 180 million americans' private healthcare plans which they love
 biden pledges to oppose school choice and he stated that if elected charter schools are gone
 and charter schools have been great
 in a second term i'll provide school choice to every parent in america
 a vote for republicans is a vote for safe communities great jobs a limitless future for all americans
 it's really a vote for the american dream
 that's what it is
 it's the american dream versus the american nightmare
 instead of letting washington change us despite all that we've been through we are changing washington
 so in concluding this wonderful afternoon and again don thank you very much but in concluding this wonderful afternoon and if the governor comes after you which he shouldn't be doing i'll be with you all the way
 i'll be with you all the way
 don't worry about a thing
 over the next four years we'll be making america into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we'll end our reliance on china once and for all
 we will make our medical supplies right here in the united states
 we will rapidly return to full employment soaring economies and record prosperity
 we will expand opportunity zones and we will continue cutting taxes and regulations at a level that nobody has ever seen before
 we will hire more police increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement surge federal prosecutors into high crime communities

 we will appoint prosecutors judges and justices who believe in enforcing the law not in enforcing their own agenda
 we will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race color religion and creed
 we will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life
 we will uphold religious liberty free speech and the right to keep and bear arms
 we will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep america out of these endless ridiculous foreign wars all coming back
 we will maintain america's unrivaled military might and we will ensure peace through strength two and a half trillion dollars have the strongest military we've ever had beautiful brand new equipment
 when i took it over it was totally depleted our military
 we have the greatest equipment that any military has ever even conceived of things that people have no idea what we have and let's keep it that way
 we will end surprise medical billing require price transparency already signed further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs will be dropping like a rock very soon
 the drug companies do not like me too much
 it's a favored nations clause i signed
 we will strongly protect medicare and your social security will be totally secure
 and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions
 america will land the first woman on the moon and the united states will be the first nation to land an astronaut on mars
 when i took over nasa was a shell of itself
 it was closed they had grass growing in the runways grass growing in the runways
 now it's the number one space center in the world by far
 we will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools
 we will teach our children to love our country honor our history and always respect our great american flag
 we will live by the timeless words of our national motto in god we trust and we're going to keep it that way
 for years you had a president who apologized for america
 now you have a president who is standing up for america and standing up for your state nevada
 so get your friends get your family get your neighbors get your coworkers and on november 3rd or sooner get out and vote
 from carson city to elko from las vegas to reno from minden to right here in henderson we stand on the shoulders of red-blooded american patriots who poured out their heart sweat and soul to secure our liberty and defend our great freedom
 nevada was founded by pioneers and prospectors miners and cowboys innovators and trailblazers who tamed the frontier raised up the mighty hoover dam transformed a sprawling desert into a shining oasis and inspired the world with the brilliant lights of the vegas strip
 our american ancestors made this into the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth and we are going to make it greater than ever before
 that's what we're doing
 proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country
 we are returning power to you the american people with your help your devotion and your drive we are you know the story going to keep on working going to keep on fighting and going to like these guys keep on winning winning winning
 you hear that colby

 okay
 he's fighting a tough customer but i don't know
 i think maybe i'm in vegas i'll have to place… is the president allowed to place a bet
 i don't know
 they'll say the president of the united states just placed two bets justin and colby
 i don't know
 i don't know but they are great
 that'd be easy money
 well maybe not that easy
 i don't know if it's that easy
 we are one movement one people one family and one glorious nation under god and together with the incredible people of nevada we will make america wealthy again we will make america strong again we will make america proud again we will make america safe again and we will make america great again
