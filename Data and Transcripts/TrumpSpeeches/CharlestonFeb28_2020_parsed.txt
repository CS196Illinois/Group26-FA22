thank you
 thank you
 thank you
 all i can say is that the fake news just doesn't get it do they
 they don't get it
 they just don't get it
 hello charleston and i'm thrilled to be back in the great state of south carolina with thousands of hardworking american patriots who believe in faith family god and country
 thank you
 it's a phenomenal crowd only topped by the number of people outside that didn't get in
 if anybody would like to give up where you're standing or your seat please raise your hand
 all right
 then let's begin right
 thank you all very much though
 this is great
 no they don't get it
 down the road they have a rally for one of the people that are going to be running tomorrow
 they're trying to get to a hundred but they're not going to make it
 so i think they're going to set up a round table
 well that's what they do
 so people want to go to a rally they end up sitting at a round table talking about their definition of impeachment
 crazy
 no it's crazy
 crazy
 it's a crazy deal
 no the fake news media they've been trying to figure this out for years
 they still don't get it though
 they don't get it
 look at all of those cameras
 look at all of those cameras
 that's a lot of cameras
 that's a lot of cameras lindsey and tim that's a lot of… they heard you guys were here
 they heard tim was here and that lindsey was here and that… and they said we're not going to attend that rally but when we heard those two guys plus our great congressmen they're here great congressmen
 but this is an incredible time for our nation
 we're thrilled to be in the midst of what we call the great american comeback and that's what it is
 jobs are booming incomes are soaring factories are returning poverty is plummeting confidence is surging and we have completely rebuilt the awesome power of the united states military
 our country is stronger than ever before
 we are stronger we are better but while we are building a great future the radical left democrats in washington are trying to burn it all down
 they have spent the last three years and i can even go further than that three years since the election but we go before the election working to erase your ballots and overthrow our democracy
 but with your help we have exposed the far left's corruption and defeated their sinister schemes and let's see what happens in the coming months
 let's watch
 let's just watch
 very dishonest people
 now the democrats are politicizing the coronavirus you know that right
 coronavirus they're politicizing it
 we did one of the great jobs
 you say how's president trump doing
 they go oh not good not good
 they have no clue
 they don't have any clue
 they can't even count their votes in iowa
 they can't even count
 no they can't
 they can't count their votes
 one of my people came up to me and said mr
 president they tried to beat you on russia russia russia
 that didn't work out too well
 they couldn't do it
 they tried the impeachment hoax
 that was on a perfect conversation
 they tried anything
 they tried it over and over
 they'd been doing it since you got in
 it's all turning
 they lost
 it's all turning
 think of it
 think of it
 and this is their new hoax
 but we did something that's been pretty amazing
 we have 15 people in this massive country and because of the fact that we went early
 we went early we could have had a lot more than that
 we're doing great
 our country is doing so great
 we are so unified
 we are so unified
 the republican party has never ever been unified like it is now
 there has never been a movement in the history of our country like we have now
 never been a movement
 so a statistic that we want to talk about go ahead
 say usa
 it's okay
 usa
 so a number that nobody heard of that i heard of recently and i was shocked to hear it 35000 people on average die each year from the flu
 did anyone know that
 35000 that's a lot of people
 it could go to 100000 it could be 27000
 they say usually a minimum of 27 goes up to 100000 people a year die
 and so far we have lost nobody to coronavirus in the united states
 nobody
 and it doesn't mean we won't and we are totally prepared
 it doesn't mean we won't but think of it
 you hear 35 and 40000 people and we've lost nobody and you wonder the press is in hysteria mode
 cnn fake news and the camera just went off the camera
 the camera just went off
 turn it back on
 hey by the way hold it
 look at this and honestly all events are like this
 it's about us
 it's all about us
 i wish they'd take the camera show the arena please
 they never do
 they never do
 they never do it
 they never show the arena
 you can hear it because when you hear it that's not 200 people
 that's not a hundred people
 that's thousands and thousands of people including people outside
 you can hear it
 they always show my face
 see that face
 they show my face
 i want them to show the arena not my face right
 how many have you been to
 how many rallies have you gone
 practically every one
 can you believe it
 i'm sure your husbands are thrilled right
 they're thrilled
 where are you going tonight
 i'm going to another trump rally
 cool
 number 114
 what do your husbands say about that
 this group up here
 she said we don't care
 thank you
 thank you
 democrats will only say horrible things even though they know we're doing a great job
 we're doing a great job with what we have to work with
 it's incredible
 the democrats want us to fail so badly
 even if their actions and you take a look hurt the people of this country they'll hurt the people themselves their wealth their everything
 they're willing to hurt our country in order to say bad even if they know it's not so
 we made an unbelievable deal with mexico with canada with china with south korea with japan
 and if you put a microphone with these people back there like the academy awards used to be not anymore
 best movie of the year
 it's made in south korea
 what's that all about
 i'm waiting to see the best movie of the year- and it's made… he said it's garbage
 only in south carolina can you say that
 only in south carolina
 you're going to get us in trouble
 no i'm just repeating what he said for the fake news
 no but seriously the academy awards has gone way way down in ratings
 do you know why
 because they started attacking us and we don't believe in it anymore
 that's why
 no but they had the best movie of the year made in south korea
 they make enough stuff for us right
 and they're good
 they're our friends
 take advantage of us that's okay
 not so much anymore
 we are really you take a look magnificently organized with the best professionals in the world
 we're prepared for the absolute worst
 you have to be prepared for the worst but hopefully it will all amount to very little
 that's why i tell you when we have the flu with 35000 people and this one we have to take it very very seriously
 that's what we're doing
 we are preparing for the worst
 my administration has taken the most aggressive action in modern history to prevent the spread of this illness in the united states
 we are ready
 we are ready
 totally ready
 on january 31st i ordered the suspension of foreign nationals who have recently been in china from entering the united states
 an action which the democrats loudly criticized and protested and now everybody's complimenting me saying thank you very much
 you were 100 correct
 could've been a whole different story
 but i say so let's get this right
 a virus starts in china bleeds its way into various countries all around the world doesn't spread widely at all in the united states because of the early actions that myself and my administration took against a lot of other wishes and the democrats' single talking point and you see it is that it's donald trump's fault right
 it's donald trump's fault
 no just things that happened
 but you know what this does show you
 things happen
 whoever thought of this two weeks ago
 who would've thought this could be going on four weeks ago
 you wouldn't
 but things happen in life and you have to be prepared and you have to be flexible and you have to be able to go out and get it
 and my guys that we have the best professionals in the world the best in the world and we are so ready
 at the same time that i initiated the first federally mandated quarantine in over 50 years
 we had a quarantine some people
 they weren't happy they weren't happy about it
 i want to tell you there are a lot of people that not so happy but after two weeks they got happy
 you know who got happy
 the people around them got happy
 that's who got happy
 i also created a white house virus task force
 it's a big thing a virus task force
 i requested 2
5 billion dollars to ensure we have the resources we need
 the democrats said that's terrible
 he's doing the wrong thing
 he needs eight and a half billion not two and a half
 i've never had that before
 i ask for two and a half they want to give me eight and a half so i said i'll take it
 does that make me a bad… i'll take it
 i'll take it
 i never had that before
 i never had it
 we want two and a half million
 that's plenty
 we demand you take eight and a half
 he doesn't know what he's doing
 we want eight and a half
 these people are crazy
 we must understand that border security is also health security
 and you've all seen the wall has gone up like magic
 it's gone up like magic
 you think that was an easy one
 that was not an easy one
 it's going up great and we're up now 132 miles and this is the exact wall that border security water everything
 this is everything they wanted 132 miles already
 we'll have 500 miles built by very early next year sometime
 one of the reasons the numbers are so good
 we will do everything in our power to keep the infection and those carrying the infection from entering our country
 we have no choice
 whether it's the virus that we're talking about or many other public health threats the democrat policy of open borders is a direct threat to the health and wellbeing of all americans
 now you see it with the coronavirus you see it
 you see it with the coronavirus
 you see that
 when you have this virus or any other virus or any other problem coming in it's not the only thing that comes in through the border
 and we're setting records now at the border
 we're setting records
 and now just using this so important right
 so important
 i'm doing well in the polls despite the worst fake news and worst presidential harassment in the history of the united states
 we've got phenomenal numbers
 no it's true
 the worst presidential harassment in history
 we had a great event yesterday an event that was so beautiful young african american leaders
 one of the things i asked them and i've been thinking about this for a long time… and great people great people
 some of them are here tonight
 do you like the name african american or black
 and they said black
 all at the same time
 no true
 i tell you
 because you say african american or black
 and they said almost immediately black
 but we had an incredible group of people and what happened is nbc… it was such a love fest
 it was so incredible
 it went on for 45 minutes
 it was a love fest
 it was incredible
 nbc turned down… there they are right there
 they turned down… comcast which owns nbc… actually nbc i think we call it msdnc right
 msdnc
 but nbc i think is worse than cnn
 i actually do
 and comcast a company that spends millions and millions of dollars on their image… i'll do everything possible to destroy their image because they are terrible
 they are terrible
 they're a terrible group of people
 and they paid me a fortune for years for the apprentice
 they paid me a fortune
 and when i left the show it was doing great
 when i left the show 14 seasons think of that they got a big movie star
 i won't tell you his name
 nobody would know
 actually nobody will know his name because he was on for such a short period of time
 but the show went down the tubes very quickly after they had trump
 but the country in five years from now of course you want to upset them five years or nine years or 13 years
 or 18 years
 10 more years
 nah
 oh they go crazy when you say it
 when you say to them five more years so it's five but you then say maybe nine maybe 13 maybe 17 maybe 21 or not maybe 21
 let's do this
 let's term limit ourselves at 25 years
 no more than 25 years
 no more
 okay
 they'll pass something in the senate
 tim pass it in the senate with lindsey a 25 year term limit please
 07
 while the extreme left has been wasting america's time with these vile hoaxes we've been killing terrorists creating jobs raising wages enacting fair trade deals securing our border and lifting up citizens of every race religion color and creed
 we added another 225000 jobs last month alone
 and that makes seven million jobs since our election seven million
 the unemployment rate in the great state of south carolina
 you ever hear of that place
 now sleepy joe would say the unemployment rate in the great state of ohio… no no
 you're in south carolina
 joe
 joe you're in south carolina
 come up
 you ever see the guy with the note no no it's south carolina
 it's not ohio
 okay
 then he goes all right iowa
 did you say iowa
 no
 no
 they did that seven times
 if i did that once it would be the end of the road right
 be the end of the road
 they'd say trump has lost it
 they like to say that anyway i guess though
 these people are bad people
 now sleepy joe
 well he's running tomorrow
 no but could you imagine if i said just a small fraction of the mistakes he makes which are unbelievable
 every speech
 i actually said the other night i was watching him when he said about half the population wiped out with guns
 i said that's a horrible thing
 that's the end of his evening
 that's the end of his political career
 and then after the debate they're revealing him and they said joe biden had a great night last night
 i don't get it tim
 the unemployment rate here in south carolina has fallen to 2
3 the lowest rate in your state's history
 the lowest rate in all of america
 it's the lowest rate in all of america
 i said to a friend of mine a democrat how's the race going tomorrow
 who's going to win
 and he says mr
 president… no it's very interesting
 he said something
 this guy's a real political pro too in all fairness even though he's a democrat
 but i said who's going to win
 he said honestly sir it doesn't matter
 you are so far ahead in south carolina that it's meaningless
 meaningless
 that's what they say
 and in north carolina too
 in north carolina bunch of losers
 the good citizens of south carolina have had a front row seat to the extremism of the democrat candidates
 whether it's this character that nobody ever heard of him
 i'd never heard it
 i thought i knew all the wealthy people
 this guy tom mr
 impeachment how did that work out tom hey he spent millions and millions of dollars in iowa right
 millions
 he got less than 1
 he got one third of 1
 i wrote a little note
 did you see it
 it said tom it's not so easy doing what i did
 is it
 not so easy
 not so easy
 all you have to do is ask mini mike
 he's in there for a fortune
 he wished he never started
 mini mike he wished he never started
 he said well trump can do it
 i'm going to do it too
 unfortunately it's not working out too well
 was that the worst debate performance in history
 they had a big audience
 everybody wanted to see whether or not he was good at what we're supposed to be doing up here
 he turned out to be a total catastrophe
 35 million people can you believe that
 that's a big audience
 very big
 and what a killer
 but this guy steyer he spends all this money
 he's not that wealthy
 he spends all of this money and you shouldn't waste your vote on him tomorrow
 i have to be honest
 by the way are the republicans allowed to vote anyway even though… are you ready
 you ready
 let's do it together
 i assume this is okay from a campaign finance standpoint i assume
 lindsey tim our great congressmen are we allowed to do this
 so am i allowed to request… first we- congressman are we allowed to do this
 am i allowed to request … first we have to figure out who would be the weakest candidate against president trump
 and then if it's legal i always say if it's permissible by law because they have so many little booby traps but they only like getting the republicans
 democrats skirt right
 but we'll see what happens about that
 the democrats
 but let me ask you this
 lindsey tim you're pros
 these are two of the greatest guys i know
 so let me ask you this
 so i don't know what the record attendance is in this arena but i was told that we broke it by a lot
 and you got the people outside
 are we allowed to tell them who we would like them to vote for
 because you're allowed to skip
 all right so wait a minute let's do a poll
 we do this for the fake news back there
 ready
 who would be the best candidate for us
 not for them
 we're ready
 ready
 so let's go through them just quickly
 we won't include steyer because he's a loser
 he's out okay
 we won't include him
 who would be the best
 this is a real poll
 this isn't one of those fake polls taken by … in all fairness i love you fox taken by fox the worst pollster
 this guy … this pollster hates trump's guts
 i was losing the last election by a fortune
 they said he did great with women
 everything was wrong
 and they never replaced this guy
 but watch this
 you ready
 so first we'll go … let's say sleepy joe right
 right
 then we'll go crazy bernie
 then we'll go mini mike
 i think he's out of it
 should we include mini mike or not
 mini mike is gone
 mini mike is gone
 i think he's gone
 he doesn't have a chance
 so let's not talk … and he's not in your election anyways so let's forget
 so mini mike i hear mini mike by the way has left
 he's basically given up
 that's what i hear
 he gave up
 he gave up
 now i hope what i just said keeps him in
 you know he's the kind of a guy he'll stay in because i don't want to be wrong
 mike it's time to go home
 go home mike and enjoy your life
 go home and spend some money on something horrible to people
 they said she's not dumb but she's just damn mean
 we can't vote for her
 she's a mean one
 she is mean
 so pocahontas should we leave her in or out
 how about klobuchar
 not going to happen
 so really we're down to two candidates right
 sleepy joe biden and crazy bernie
 so this is a poll
 i guarantee you this
 as much as they hate me they hate me
 they're going to put this all over the place
 we have a poll of like 30000 people inside and out
 they're doing it outside too
 we have a poll
 are you ready
 who do i … so in other words who's the weaker of the two
 i'm not interested in who does better
 no no
 i'm not interested … wait
 ready
 in other words who do i want to run against
 meaning … very simple
 we put it into nice simple language
 who the hell is easier to beat
 so who is easier for us
 not me
 for us to beat
 ready
 crazy bernie
 or sleepy joe
 i don't know
 i think maybe a crazy bernie has it a little bit
 once more just quick
 ready
 he said it doesn't matter you'll beat them all
 i hope so
 i hope so
 so who is easier to beat crazy bernie or sleepy joe
 they think bernie's easier to beat
 they think bernie's easier to beat
 so whether it's bernie sanders' plan to eliminate private healthcare elizabeth warren's plan
 i told you that i had more indian blood in me than her even though i have none
 i have none
 zero
 i have none
 i have none
 i said i have more indian blood in me than she has
 and she choked
 she said i'm going to show
 i'm going to show
 she hired this company and they went out and did a blood test
 1024th right
 so that means i probably one somewhere down the line a million years ago
 i'm telling you that was horrible
 she choked
 we don't want a person to win that chokes
 we don't want to choke artist right
 one thing you will say about me i'm not a choker
 with all these people for years they're after me years
 we can't have chokers
 we can't have chokers as your president
 so elizabeth warren's plan to eliminate america's borders
 that's what she would … or mini mike's plan to eliminate your second amendment and take away your guns
 how about that
 mini mike wants to take away your guns
 the insanity of the democrat party is why millions of registered democrat voters are joining our movement
 they are joining our great new republican party
 this november we are going to take back the house
 we are going to hold the senate and we are going to keep the white house
 i wonder what they say when they go down the road and they see these groups of 200 people
 seriously
 i wonder what they say
 they never talk about it
 they'll say joe biden had a fabulous crowd today
 fabulous
 so fabulous that there's like five people
 and they'll leave and they'll say president trump had a smattering of applause
 smattering
 they use the word smattering a lot
 this is not … let's let them hear it
 this is not a … this is a big … this is not a smattering
 it's not a smattering
 turn the cameras
 that's not a smattering
 that is not a smattering
 i hate it
 they say donald trump … in india i hate to say this to you but … so they actually have 129000 seat stadium
 did you see it
 the place was packed and they did better than most
 they gave me credit for 100000
 that was not bad
 it's 129
 the stadium holds 100
 they had a field that's about three times … it's cricket
 it's the biggest stadium
 and they had 129
 i was with the prime minister of india modi
 great guy loved by the people of india
 and we had an amazing thing
 and i went in and here's the problem
 this is a big crowd
 and normally i like talking about my crowds because i get the crowds like nobody but i just got back from 140 or 50 or 60000 people and now i'm coming here
 what does this place hold 15
 it's hard to be enthused
 you understand that
 i may never be excited again about a crowd after going to india
 think of this they have 1
5 billion people
 we have 350 so we're doing pretty well i'll tell you what but i love this crowd and i love that crowd too
 tell you they have a great love for … they have a great love
 they have a great leader and they have a great love for the people of this country
 that was really a worthwhile trip
 with us tonight are both of your incredible us senators
 two incredible friends two warriors
 senator lindsey graham and senator tim scott come up here
 and by the way tim's incredible mother is right here in the front row
 as they're doing that they got this big … i was going to almost do a poll on the two of them but we're not doing that
 but lindsey is a true fighter for south carolina
 loves your state
 and as chairman of the senate judiciary committee … you know that right
 he's the chairman of the senate judiciary committee
 so important
 so important
 senator graham has been leading the charge to help us confirm a record number of judges to uphold the constitution as written
 lindsey was amazing you remember for justice brett kavanaugh
 remember how badly he … great job lindsey
 great job man
 thank you
 senator scott is a leading superstar
 he's a superstar
 but he is a leader in lowering healthcare costs like nobody has done it
 people don't know but in the last year prescription drug prices came down for the first time in 51 years
 and that was with no democrat help
 if we had the help we could lower it by 50
 but we'll get their help
 one of these days they're going to get smart
 senator scott provides world class care for our veterans
 what he's done for our veterans is incredible
 and bringing investment to distressed communities across our country through opportunity zones including 135 right here in south carolina
 that's what it is
 tim scott came to my office with an idea
 he said opportunity zone
 i said tim what the hell is that
 what is it
 right tim
 and he went through a whole big thing and i said this maybe could work and we tried it
 it is an incredible success and what he's done for this country is incredible
 it's incredible
 lindsey
 we'll start with lindsey
 say a few words please
 thank you
 well that was quite a display wasn't it
 now there's a lot of love in this room
 a lot of people say to me friends of mine they've very successful
 they'll say how do you speak in front of 25000 people and 10000 people and all of this
 you know why
 there's such love in the room it's easy
 no it's true
 there is such … i explained they don't understand it because they're not for doing that but i say there is such unbelievable love in the room that it's easy to do
 very easy
 right
 it's sort of easy to do
 we're also thrilled to be joined by many more great leaders from across the state
 and some of you maybe know i liked this guy for a long time governor henry mcmaster
 come up henry
 come up henry
 representatives joe wilson jeff duncan william timmons ralph norman tom rice and the chairman of the south carolina republican party drew mckissick
 as i introduce somebody and i'll just say stay there because he was brave but he got hit hard
 he's a very special man retired marine corps major general and most of you know he received the congressional medal of honor james e
 livingston
 james just relax
 where's james
 he got hit hard
 thank you james
 congressional medal of honor winner
 thank you james
 they are great brave people
 you know we have the congressional medal of honor and we have the presidential medal of freedom and they're both the highest awards
 one civilian one is military
 i always say getting the presidential medal of freedom is much less painful because when i read them off i'll read like with james or with so many of the congressional medal of honors many are not living to be honest with you
 and i'll read stories where one of them recently going up a hill hit 19 times by gunfire grabbing four people bringing them down getting onto a helicopter falling out of the helicopter hitting a tree on the way down
 hitting a tree
 they went back and saved him but he died later
 i mean those are tough deals
 those are tough deals
 we have one right here who's living
 we have one right here who's living
 but they are tough
 so thank you very much for being here
 and maybe i could ask our governor our great governor of this incredible state to say a few words
 please henry
 thank you very much
 and where's alan
 is your son here
 you're great son attorney general
 alan thank you very much
 take good care of him okay
 thank you
 thank you alan
 and thanks to republicans all over america
 we are now working on things that nobody ever thought possible
 since my election over 121000 new jobs have been created right here in south carolina
 we've lifted 10 million people off welfare including 7 million off of food stamps
 and that's a good thing not a bad thing
 they're working and they have great jobs and they love getting up in the morning and they're making much more money and it costs our country nothing
 we make money they pay taxes
 it's a whole different deal
 median household income has reached the highest level in the history of our country
 the unemployment rate nationwide has hit the lowest rate in over 50 years
 the average unemployment rate from my administration is the lowest for any us president in recorded history
 how about that one
 it's a good one
 that's a good one
 the unemployment rate among african-americans hispanic americans and asian americans has reached record lows
 black youth unemployment has reached an all time low
 black poverty levels are the lowest ever recorded in the history of our country
  paid family leave
 reducing the cost of childcare and giving 40 million american families an average of 2200 more in their pocket thanks to the republican child tax credit
 republican not democrat
 we are reversing decades of calamitous trade policies that decimated manufacturing all across your state and all across our country
 for years politicians sold you out to global special interests enriching other countries at your expense
 that ended
 that ended
 but i am not the president of the globe
 i don't want to be the president of the world
 i am the president of the united states of america
  reciprocal
 reciprocal
 got to be fair
 after years of building up other countries we are finally rebuilding our country
 we are finally putting america first
 on no issue of washington democrats more thoroughly sold out the american people than the issue of immigration
 every democrat running for president supports free federal welfare for illegal aliens funded by you the american taxpayer
 they want to treat illegal aliens people that come into our country illegally better than they want to treat our military and our veterans
 not only does illegal immigration drain our treasury but it threatens innocent lives
 i recently invited to the white house the granddaughter of a 92 year old woman who was raped beaten brutalized and murdered by an illegal alien who had previously been set free in new york city
 here in charleston county an illegal alien was recently charged with sexually assaulting a young girl in the fourth grade
 in berkeley county officers captured a previously deported ms-13 gang member who shot a man to death before dousing the body in gasoline and setting him on fire
 and he should have never been in our country
 he shouldn't have been allowed
 it's being built
 it's being built
 by the way just in case you haven't heard it is being built
 that you know
 and they're going to go nuts
 they're going to go nuts
 they thought they got me
 they said okay
 have you heard them recently
 okay
 he's building the wall
 and you think it's easy getting that kind of money to build a wall when i have a whole party and a deep state and some never-trumpers
 they're a dying breed though
 the good thing they're on respirator
 they're on respirator
 they're on mouth to mouth resuscitation
 you can do it
 i'm not doing it
 they're on mouth to mouth resuscitation the never-trumpers
 but you think it's easy
 it's not
 but that's been built
 but you know what they say now
 okay
 he's building the wall but mexico's not paying for it
 yes they are actually
 they are
 they are
 they are paying for it
 and some of the fake news knows that but they refuse to report it but that's okay
 you'll see
 you'll see what's going on
 and i want to thank mexico because by the way right now they have 27000 soldiers on our border protecting our border
 we have mexico protecting our border
 and they only do that for trump
 they don't do that for sleepy joe
 they don't do that for crazy bernie
 and they don't do it for mini mike that's for sure
 they're only doing that for trump right
 27000 soldiers protecting our border
 in this region … … thousand soldiers protecting our border
 in this region of the country alone last year ice … they've been treated so badly right
 they are great
 they're brave
 they're tough
 any men
 there are tough guys in here but anybody want to be an ice officer
 it's tough stuff right
 they go into those nests
 they call them nest
 that's where these guys get together and they knock the hell
 i mean if they have to … i have to be very careful
 i don't want to get them in trouble because the press wants us to be very politically correct
 so let me change it around
 they go into a nest of ms13 and they say oh hello gentlemen
 how are you
 on occasion they have a fight
 they never lose those fights
 we need people like that
 hello gentleman
 how are you
 how many people did you kill last year
 how many people did you get kill last year with a knife because they like knives because it's more painful
 this is the kind of people that we were letting into our country
 ice has taken them out of our country by the thousands
 by the thousands
 last year ice officers arrested 12000 criminal aliens charged or convicted of dangerous offenses including robbery rape and many for a thing called murder
 on wednesday we won the big case in federal court
 did you see that
 did you see that
 we won the case unanimously
 unanimously
 federal appeals court where we don't have to give money to sanctuary cities and states if they don't work with us finally
 finally
 finally
 why should we
 yet the democrat candidates oppose all detention of illegal aliens
 they want unfettered catch and release
 we have ended that program
 it was not easy
 we have to go through courts
 everything is a court
 everything is a suit
 we do anything
 we turn to the right they sue us
 we turn to the left they sue us
 we win
 but we're winning
 we have 218 judges now
 it's good
 let me just preface that by saying i know they give fair opinions
 it bears no relationship to who appoints them but i never win with an obama appointed judge ever
 i don't win
 no we have great judges going onto the courts
 great judges
 they're fair judges
 they're judges that truly love our constitution
 it's great
 they're judges that if we feel it's right they don't want to invite the world to trespass across our borders
 very simple
 the democrat field also supports deadly sanctuary cities that release violet criminal aliens
 you know that
 you've been reading
 all you have to do is pick up a paper every day
 they release these horrible criminals to terrorize our communities
 we don't do that anymore
 we won't let it happen and now we don't have to give sanctuary cities and states the money that they're going to want
 it's a whole game changer
  i don't think he's doing a good job
 this guy doesn't know he's alive
 oh what bad people
 republicans believe america should be a sanctuary for law abiding americans not for criminal aliens
 thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border we have reduced illegal border crossings by a staggering 75 since last spring and we have ended catch and release permanently
 you know what catching release is
 we catch them we grab them
 we say could we please have your address
 address
 i don't know what the hell is an address
 they don't have an address
 could we have a number
 do you have a phone
 could we call your mother or your father and say in four years you have to come to court
 what they do is they catch him they get some information that the guy has no idea where he lives and it's one of those things in many cases and then release
 we release him into our country
 we don't do that anymore
 if you knew what it took … we catch them and we take some information and we release them in and we say please report back in four years from now for your trial
 about 2 come back and they're the ones that are the dumbest people i've ever seen
 2
 nobody comes back
 it's crazy but we're getting a change
 it would be so easy
 they call it loopholes
 loopholes
 that word alone they call it loopholes
 it would be so easy if we had some democrat support
 we don't have any democrat support
 they want open borders
 they don't care about crime
 border patrol has seized the largest amount of deadly narcotics ever in the history of our country this last year
 we have deported record numbers of gang members
 we are building the wall faster than ever and we will soon be rebuilding more than one mile a day
 washington democrats have never been more extreme
 132 congressional democrats have signed up for bernie sanders' healthcare takeover
 they want to take away your healthcare
 while the washington democrats are trying to destroy your healthcare and to destroy your social security
 that's what's going to happen
 my administration is protecting your social security your medicare and is fighting to give you great healthcare
 we are defending your right to keep the doctor and to keep your plan of choice
 remember when president obama would say you can keep your doctor
 you could keep your plan
 28 times
 he said you can keep your doctor and you can keep your plan
 well he lied
 we should impeach him
 we should impeach him for that
 he lied 28 times
 you'll keep your doctor keep your plan
 it's wonderful
 great
 went through the roof
 we're doing a great job
 we killed the individual mandate which is the most unbelievable horrible
 it's not really obamacare anymore but we're running the hulk of it and we're trying to kill it entirely and then we will put it back
 you'll have great health care and preexisting conditions will be totally protected
 preexisting conditions will be totally protected
 we're making healthcare better and much cheaper
 while premiums more than doubled in the five years before i took office we are now offering plans already that are up to 60 less expensive than the old obamacare
 think of that and better
 and better
 we are stopping surprise medical billing a disgrace
 i signed an executive order imposing price transparency because when providers are required to show their prices which they don't have to do but now they do those same prices fall very very fast
 we have approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs which are just as good as the name brand drugs but at a tiny fraction of the cost
 they're just as good
 i always like a name brand
 i mean there's something
 there's no difference
 probably sometimes they're better
 we've totally transformed veteran's healthcare getting long ought va choice and va accountability passed after 50 years
  the spectacular right to try
 you know what that is
 if you're terminally ill you go all over the world
 if you have no money you can't
 you go home and you die
 you're terminally ill
 they go all over the world
 if they have money they go to asia they go to europe
 they're searching
 we have the greatest doctors in the world the greatest labs in the world greatest technicians in the world and we have pipelines of drugs coming out for different problems
 now you sign a piece of paper
 we're not going to hold anybody liable
 you get to use that drug and the results have been unbelievable
 unbelievable
 hopefully you don't need it but now we have right to try
 they've been trying for 51 years to get that approved
 51 years and we got it approved
 i guess i'm good at getting things approved aren't i
 those people that i brought up here where the reason too every one of them
 they were incredible
 thank you
 thank you
 senators congressman they were the reasons
 we are combating the opioid epidemic
 drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 32 years
 we have launched new initiatives combating kidney disease which is a big deal
 kidney disease is so tough that people die literally because it's so much work
 they die from overwork
 it's just crazy
 in theory they could keep them going for a long time but the work and the dialysis and all of the things they have to do
 we've done things that make it so much easier and it's just such an honor to be involved
 also alzheimer's disease we're really making strides
 it's really a great thing
 great thing
 we're pursuing new advances in neonatal research to care for america's youngest patients and breaking all records in so doing
 virtually every democrat candidate has declared their unlimited support for extreme late term abortion ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up until the very moment of birth
 that is why i've asked congress to prohibit late term abortion of babies because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift of god
 the democrat party is the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion socialism blatant corruption and the total obliteration of your second amendment
 the republican party is the party of the american worker the american family the american dream and of course the late great abraham lincoln
 republicans are fighting for citizens from every background every community and every walk of life
 we are the party of boundless optimism excitement energy and enthusiasm
 we are a big tent
 we are a big party
 we are the party of big ideas for the future
 this is where it is
 this is where it is
 this is not the old republican party
 this is a very inclusive party
 this is a great party
 republicans are proudly fighting for nationwide school choice including right here in south carolina
 we want to give school choice to every child in america who needs it from kindergarten to 12th grade because no parent should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school
 i passed criminal justice reform to give former prisoners a second chance at life
 that's a big deal
 this could not have been done by anyone but the republican party
 they came to me a group of people and they wanted criminal justice reform
 i wasn't sure about the issue but we had a lot of great republicans very much in favor of it including people that happen to be right here today
 they were very much and i started studying the issue worked hard on the issue and criminal justice reform
 you saw alice johnson come out of prison
 22 years
 she had another 20 years left
 think of it
 for a phone call
 for a phone call
 a great woman but we have many people coming out that shouldn't be there for anywhere near those terms
 not for those terms
 but they came to see me a group
 a group of people came
 van jones he came up
 oh thank you sir
 they needed four senators
 they needed help
 i called lindsey i called everybody
 i called tim who's so great on everything
 i called everybody
 they needed four senators and maybe five and they needed help with some of the ones that weren't moving in the right direction
 i gave it to them and i got it and it was not easy
 we get criminal justice reform and then i signed it
 then this van jones has a program that gets no ratings absolutely at all
 they say van jones wants to thank everybody for criminal justice reform
 i called our great first lady over
 i said darling please take a look
 it's going to be so nice because honestly look they couldn't have done even close without me
 i got all these people together got them done
 it was impossible
 previous presidents couldn't even think about it
 they couldn't even think about doing it and they tried although i don't think they tried too hard bur they could have never done it
 so he gets up and he starts by saying i want to thank the reverend al sharpton
 i knew al when he was very heavy
 he looked better when he was heavy
 it's true
 he's one of the few people he really looked better when he was heavy
 he looked much better when he was heavy
 i've got to tell him
 i have to explain because i know him very well
 he would admit that he has a lot of respect for your president but he can't admit it on television
 but he called and he said i want to take the reverend al sharpton and then name after name after name of people that i never heard of
 my wife said are they going to think about you right
 are they going to think about you
 i said darling of course
 i said he's saving me til the end because i was by far
 it's true
 this is true tim
 lindsay this is true
 i said he's saving me til the end
 it's going to be such an honor to be recognized because i don't get enough publicity
 i need a little bit more
 he got to the end and he didn't say it and she looked at me
 she sort of smiled
 i think she loved it in a certain way
 but she sort of smiled
 she said that's too bad
 i said yeah it is
 then he said i have one more thing to say
 we must get out this year and fight and vote against this president of the united states
 can you believe that
 it's true
 it's a true story
 van jones
 these are just terrible that they could … i was a little embarrassed in front of our great first lady but i'll live through it somehow
 i recognized israel's true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem
 we recognized israeli sovereignty over the golan heights
 52 years
 52 years that golan heights had been fighting and fighting for it
 i did it and i did the true capital jerusalem right
 how many presidents promise that
 every president for many many decades promised we're going to do that
 they never did it
 i did it
 we did a lot
 we've invested more than 2 trillion in the united states military including more than 150 million this year in joint base charleston fort jackson and paris island
 we created the sixth branch of the american armed forces the space force
 we have another branch
 72 years
 not for 72 years the air force have they done a new branch
 we did the space force
 when i first said it everybody thought i was joking
 i said i'm not joking
 they thought it was from the comic strips or the future movies
 i said no it's all about space
 in a number of years people are going to say i can't believe we didn't do this sooner
 we need a little vision
 we need a little foresight
 you know what
 i mentioned space force
 at arenas like this it gets one of the biggest hands because that's where it's at
 that's where it's going unfortunately or fortunately
 we needed it for defense
 we needed it for offense
 sixth branch
 72 years
 for years we watched as your politicians apologize for america
 now you have a president who is standing up for america and we are standing up for the people of south carolina
 at stake in our present battle is the actual survival of our nation
 i really believe that it's the survival
 you see these maniacs that we're dealing with
 they want to give away everything
 we will end up being venezuela large scale version
 if you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of americans have fought and died for to secure then we must devote everything we have towards a victory in november of 2020 november 3rd to be exact
 only this way can we save the america we love and drain the swamp
 i never thought it was this deep
 man
 i talked about a swamp
 you never told me it was this bad fellas
 that swamp is bad
 you got dirty cops at the top of the fbi
 you got a lot of dirty people but you also have phenomenal people in the fbi and other places but we're draining that swamp
 i never knew it was going to be this dirty and we're getting a lot of help from a lot of great people
 with your help we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work dependence to independence and from poverty to prosperity
 that's what's happening
 think of it
 from poverty to prosperity
 look at some of the stories that you have over there
 look at some of the incredible stories
 look at tim scott
 look at that incredible story

 it's an incredible story
 lindsay will say it
 i give about 99 of the credit to tim scott's mother
 i do
 i guarantee you tim there was no games right
