well i thank you very much
 so i want to start by saying hello nevada
 how are you doing
 how are you
 and i'm thrilled to be in douglas county but people are coming from all over the place
 there's a lot of people for douglas county isn't it
 we have thousands and thousands of loyal hardworking american patriots that's what we have
 and 52 days from now we're going to win nevada and we're going to win four more years in the white house
 and then after that we'll negotiate right
 ‘cause we're probably based on the way we were treated we're probably entitled to another four after that
 and it should never happen to another president
 that's just a dishonest group of people
 but here we are and we're going to be here for another four years
 the governor of your state- … tried very hard to stop us from having this event tonight
 he didn't like us having… they can have riots and they can have all sorts of things and that's okay you can burn up the house that's okay
 we call this a protest because if you call it a protest you're allowed to have it
 it's okay
 so if anybody asks you outside this is called a friendly protest okay
 it's true
 you can't have political rallies
 that's because of me because if biden were here he'd have about three people
 do you ever see him with his little circles
 the circle
 you know why he puts the circles
 because he wants to be like correct with covid but it's not really because they can't get anybody to fill up a room
 so they put these big circles
 so he can't get anybody to fill
 nobody wants to go
 oh boy the fake news look at all those people back there the fakers
 that's true
 boy they covered
 did you see the other day now they're finding out that to do an interview an interview they ask him a question
 that means they're giving him the questions they never gave me questions before
 so to do an interview he demands on getting the questions and his people write out the answer
 so they ask him a question
 he goes bring it up closer i can't see it dammit
 great
 this is something
 you know we have a debate coming up in three weeks
 and here's the problem
 winston churchill
 did you ever hear of winston churchill
 winston churchill was a great debater
 great
 and if joe gets off the stage walks off the stage if he makes it which i think he probably will in all fairness he's been doing this for 47 years right
 i think he probably will
 if he gets off the stage they're going to say it was the single greatest debate they've ever seen
 winston churchill was nothing compared to sleepy joe
 you know that you know that they're going to say what a great performance
 he was great today
 he was great
 this guy was great
 nah he's not great
 but your governor tried to stop us
 he tried to stop us
 the governor of nevada he tried to stop us and we went to different venues
 kelly o'donnell she's a fading reporter for nbc
 do you know that
 she was on she said well they have a crowd tonight
 behind her it looked like 25000 people
 that's what we have by the way a lot more coming in
 but she said he's got maybe a thousand people a thousand
 you know what i got
 i have a thousand people here
 no this is the fake news
 you know what
 it's not a question of how many… they are just a bunch of dishonest people i've never seen anything like it
 being in real estate and being in new york and being in all over i've seen a lot of dishonest people
 i think the media the fake news is the most dishonest group of people i've ever seen anywhere in my entire life
 and that includes by the way leaders of foreign countries that aren't our friends okay
 that's a big statement
 they really are bad news
 but here we are and this is really amazing
 the governor tried to stop us he couldn't but think of this he's in control of millions of votes
 here's a guy calling venues telling them not to have the rally calling different venues don't have the rally
 we're not going to let you have the rally
 and he's calling this governor who was a political hack he was a political hack and then he became governor
 and this is the guy that we're entrusting with millions of ballots unsolicited ballots millions and millions
 and then we're supposed to win these states and we have a guy that would do that where he won't let us have and we call it a protest and therefore we can do it
 but you want to know something
 it's a disgrace
 so who the hell is going to trust
 they say trust government
 well how would you trust a guy that fought that we aren't here that we can't have all these thousands of people
 boy you are really back far
 that's… look at that
 no but seriously
 and now he's in charge of the election and the millions of ballots
 so if i'm up like millions of votes he can rig the election he can rig the election
 and i'll tell you what whether it's in north carolina whether it's in michigan whether it's in other states where they're sending out they're going to be sending out 80 million ballots
 and it's democrats
 they're trying to rig this election at every single place in the last year year and a half go modern day forget about… tiny amounts a congressional race in new york a small number of votes
 if you go to new jersey if you go to virginia if you go to pennsylvania if you go to california look at some of these races every one of these races was a fraud missing ballots
 and i don't mean like 1
 i mean like 20 25 they're trying to rig the election
 they should make people if you register if you want a solicited ballot that's where you ask for it
 you have to sign papers
 you get it because you can't be there
 that's one thing
 when they send 80 million ballots to people they have no idea where they're going
 actually they probably do have a good idea where they're going and that's our problem
 they send 80 million ballots out
 where are they going
 who are they sending them to
 are they sending them to certain areas and not other areas
 are they sending them to democrat areas
 these are all controlled by democrat governors like your politically motivated governor
 so just to finish on that look just to finish on that he's a guy that tried to silence us by not having this
 and it ended up our crowd turned out to be a lot bigger than nbc which is owned by concast
 c-o-n concast
 c-o-n-c-a-s-t concast
 it's really comcast but i call it con because it's a whole con
 i'll tell you what in the old days i think it should still be news when they broadcast had to be reasonably accurate right
 and they had licensing
 today they can do whatever the hell they want
 it's fake news and it's a disgrace
 and you know what back there and i'll tell you it's hurting our country
 it's hurting our country
 they're the biggest problem that this country has is the fake news media worse than the democrats because the democrats are their partners
 they play together
 joe biden spent the last 47 years selling out america offshoring your jobs throwing open your borders depleting our military and sacrificing your children's future in china
 i've spent the last four years bringing our jobs back to america securing our borders rebuilding our military and standing up to china like never before
 nobody has ever stood up to china like we have stood up to china and you haven't seen the last of it
 sleepy joe biden who surrendered you know where he is now he's in his damn basement again
 no he's in his basement
 he's in his basement
 but i can be bad to him because he put the most vicious ad on television that i've ever seen
 do you know what i'm talking about
 where i'm standing over the graves of our fallen warriors our fallen heroes
 these are great people the greatest people there are and i'm standing over there and they have some sleazebag reporter from a third rate magazine having some source quoting me saying i won't even use the term but saying bad things
 and there's nobody that loves our military respects it and the people more than me
 and they took… and i didn't even ask
 we had 25 people that were witnesses that are on the record already that have said that never took place
 it never took place what they said
 and yet pathetic joe and he's a pathetic human being to allow that to happen
 here's the problem he doesn't even know what happened i don't think
 i think he has no idea but he's a pathetic human being to let that happen where they put an ad like that where i'm standing over graves
 and then they said he said this with no sources no nothing
 they got nothing
 and i have 25 real witnesses with the names with everything saying it never happened
 and they put an ad like that up they're a disgrace
 but you know the good part
 now i can be really vicious
 i can be really vicious
 and we'll start by saying we're going to start by saying that the democrats are trying to rig this election because it's the only way they're going to win
 the only way they're going to win is to rig it
 biden's surrendered your jobs to china
 look his son walked away with a billion and a half dollars give me a break give me a… his son's going to say dad you can't take this money away
 don't do it dad please i don't… you know how much experience he had
 there's a young man here he's a very young young man handsome young guy
 he's about like 12
 you know what
 he's got more experience than hunter
 hunter
 where's hunter
 where is he
 with no experience no knowledge of energy no job got thrown out of the military… you know he got thrown out by the way
 i used to be nice about that
 now i don't
 once i saw that ad i don't have to be nice anymore
 okay i really mean it
 and by the way on that ad i know some horrible people horrible human beings some of the worst people in the world i really do they're horrible none of those people and they're the worst the worst real estate developers in new york you don't get much worse
 i know some of the worst people in the world not one person do i know that would say that standing on top of graves of heroes really not one person
 so i will tell you this so now we can play it like it is
 let's face it joe is shot
 let's face it okay
 he's shot
 so not that he has anything to do because he won't know what's happening
 he'll just be locked up in a room someplace and the radical left is going to be running our country
 four more years four more years four more years four more years four more years four more years four more years four more years four more years
 thank you
 but now he wants to surrender our country to the violent left wing mob
 you know that
 if biden wins china wins
 if biden wins the mob wins
 you see what's going on with all these democratic or i always say democrat-run cities and states
 it's a disaster
 it's a disaster
 and we keep saying let us bring in the troops
 well we did it in minneapolis we ended it
 in 45 minutes it was ended
 they went through two weeks
 by the way we could do it in portland in half an hour
 it would all be over
 but we have these stupid people that think… how about that poor mayor
 is that pathetic wheeler is that pathetic
 they forced him out of his home
 he's now finding a new home it's so nice
 it's pathetic
 honestly it's pathetic
 we could solve that problem in a half an hour just like we did
 and by the way the us marshals did a great job in portland
 they did a great job
 you know what i mean
 if biden wins the rioters win the anarchists win arsonists flag burners they all win
 i'm running for reelection to bring prosperity to nevada to the whole country
 i've been here a long time
 i have some things in nevada that are very good to put violent criminals behind bars and to ensure the future belongs to america not to china
 i do get a kick out of watching a guy oh i'm going to do this
 he copied my whole plan
 you see he says buy america i said where the hell have you been for the last half century
 thank you
 could i ask the fake news to take your cameras and show all the way back there for hundreds of yards all the way back there
 take your cameras
 go as far as the eye can see
 no no tell nbc news it's not a thousand people
 you can't see it
 you can't see it down here
 you won't believe how many people
 that thing goes back… so the bottom line is when we win america wins that's what's happening
 and nobody's done to china what i did
 look billions tens of billions of dollars of tariffs we took in
 i gave 28 billion to farmers
 the farmers are doing very well
 they're doing very well
 thank you
 thank you president trump
 28 billion
 16 billion one year 12 billion
 they were targeted
 i said how much is it
 sonny perdue secretary of agriculture great guy said how much were they hurt by
 sir 12 billion two years ago and 16 billion last year
 i said all right good
 we'll take it out of china
 we gave them 28 billion to the farmers
 that never happened before
 you think joe biden would even think about it
 he wouldn't even think about it
 he wouldn't even think about it
 no he's more worried about does he have a teleprompter to answer a reporter's question
 the worst part about that isn't the fact that he's doing that because let's face it he's unable okay
 it's not that it's that the fake news would give him the questions
 they never gave me the questions
 did you ever give me questions back there
 did you ever give me… they don't give me questions
 the fake news would give him questions but of course now donna brazile works for fox so that's gone a long way
 remember
 remember when donna brazile gave crooked hillary the questions right
 to a debate
 and then she said well i don't think i did it
 i don't remember
 i knew she was in trouble when she said i don't remember doing that
 i don't remember
 she didn't remember
 oh okay
 well as long as you don't remember
 it's true
 it's true too
 it's true
 you know what i used to stand back and i'd say be quiet please
 don't say that
 it's really not nice
 you know it's true
 she deleted 33… think of it
 they'll never find the emails because they were acid washed deleted
 but you know what
 she got a subpoena from the united states congress right
 and she and her lawyer deleted 33000 emails after she got a united states subpoena
 and you say why isn't she guilty of a major crime
 right
 and then she took her telephones and she smashed them with a hammer
 right
 and then she took the other ones and she deleted them
 and now the mueller scam these people the worst people
 i have a friend a very smart guy very streetwise guy
 he said you have to be the most honest guy in the world to go through three years of investigations where they have the worst human beings in the world
 they worked for the democrats
 they worked… i mean mueller didn't have a clue
 this guy was totally… but look at this weissmann how bad was weissmann
 he deleted his phone
 that's illegal
 he deleted everything
 they all deleted
 and they all said oh gee we made a mistake
 we're sorry
 they all used the same mistake
 they all made… it was oh gee we didn't mean to do that
 every one of them all of them
 i think it was 31 different phones they deleted
 these are criminals we're dealing with
 and they've got to… there has to be a repercussion
 there has to be a repercussion
 we're dealing with criminals
 so i don't care if you say it anymore because you know what
 she illegally deleted and her lawyers should go to jail with her okay
 and the fact is the republican party doesn't play it rough and tough like those people they don't play it the same way
 they're too nice
 and we have better policy
 thank goodness we have better… we believe in borders
 we believe in no sanctuary cities
 we believe in lowering taxes
 we have better but our people don't… we have some that are very good
 jim jordan good right
 jim jordan
 mark meadows good right
 no we have some very good but i'll tell you what we play it so nice and in the end it's not right because what they get away with… and obama and biden got caught spying on our campaign using the intelligence i put that in quotes using intelligence to spy on our campaign and they got caught
 they got caught
 and if it was me that got caught forget about it
 but they got caught and somebody said  well i know but he was president
 oh great i'm president too
 and a hell of a lot better president than he is i can tell you that
 obama came into office they gave him the nobel prize like almost immediately right
 in fact he didn't even know why he got it
 he didn't even know he had no idea why he got it
 and he was right about that because nobody else does either
 they still don't know but we've done a lot of things
 so we were nominated a few days ago for a nobel prize which is a big thing
 nobel peace prize
 and then yesterday we were nominated a second time for another nobel prize
 now that's a big thing
 to me it's a big thing even though obviously it's a very political thing but it's a very big thing
 the nobel peace prize right
 i got it was just reported
 i'm just reporting this i got zero time on the nightly news on the network news
 zero zero
 we got zero time
 think of it the president of your country is honored by being nominated for the nobel peace prize and your nightly news abc which is terrible cbs which is terrible and probably the worst of all owned by concast they spend a fortune on pr and then every time i get up i call them concast and sort of wipe out their fortune
 but they are bad people
 but nbc is the worst of them all not one mentioned
 these people are corrupt
 not one mentioned not one mentioned
 so your president gets a nobel and at least a nomination and they don't mention it
 joe biden cannot lead our country because he doesn't really believe in our country
 right now i don't think he believes in anything he just wants to go to sleep
 that's all
 please darling i want to go to bed
 i'm exhausted
 i made one speech yesterday
 but darling they gave you the answers and the questions
 i know but that was a big strain because my eyes i couldn't see the teleprompter
 this guy is the worst
 i am… and you know it's going to maybe come back to haunt me because we have a rigged election
 it's a rigged election
 it's the only way we're going to lose but i'll tell you what he is the worst candidate in the history of presidential… he is the worst candidate in the history of presidential politics
 he doesn't know he's alive
 he doesn't know he's alive
 and i got to know president xi of china very well president putin of russia kim jong-un
 by the way what happened to the war
 i thought we was going to war with kim jong-un
 where's the war
 where's the war
 oh i see
 oh i see
 it never happened did it
 never happened did it
 well maybe some day could happen
 no remember
 trump is going to be …  you know my personality right
 trump is going to be a war at within the first week after he wins
 where's the war

in fact the peace prize was because i stayed out of wars and by the way ended certain wars that could have happened that you don't even know about
 and look what we did just yesterday in europe and look what we did with israel and you just saw that with united arab emirates and bahrain
 thank you
 thank you
 thank you
 thank you very much
 thank you very much
 now after this is over you'll have like at nbc this third-rate reporter stand up
 they had a small crowd a insignificant crowd in a great location
 you know how great it was
 we landed we had to drive for 50 minutes
 that's how great
 but i like it anyway
 i'll take it
 i'll take it anyway
 i like it
 you're my kind of people
 we love each other
 i like it
 we landed the big beautiful air force one
 i just asked as we're coming in why couldn't we have landed here
 i would have rather then i could have had the plane right behind me
 instead we have the beast
 see the beast
 what you don't know is the beast costs almost as much as the plane
 it's a hell of a car
 it's a walking army tank the beast
 but we could have
 i said why don't we just land here
 and we couldn't
 so i get off the plane
 oh good
 how long will it be
 about 50 minutes
 that's a long drive
 and driving here there were tens of thousands of people on the streets with flags
 and then you read these fake reporters and they say president trump is tied in nevada tied
 i don't think so
 the only way we're tied is if they screw around with the ballots which they will do in my opinion
 okay
 we're not tied anywhere
 i asked some people that traveled with obama
 i said was it the same thing
 they say not even a tiny fraction of what you have
 there's not even a fraction
 we have more enthusiasm
 we have more spirit than any campaign that anybody's ever seen
 it's true
 and that includes 2016 where the enthusiasm obviously was great
 how about all those states that we weren't supposed to win
 no he won't win there
 he won't win there
 then all night long donald trump won the great state of texas
 donald trump won the great state of …  this and that and one after another
 was that one of the coolest things watching their people go crazy
 they went crazy
 no they went crazy
 how is he going to do in georgia
 well i think george is going to be very close
 it's going to be very close
 they go the polls in georgia have closed
 donald trump wins the state of georgia
 you know why
 because we won by so much that they can do it simultaneously by saying the polls closed and he won
 we had many of them
 right
 and by the way we're doing great
 i just had … florida is a biggie a good one
 and we are winning in florida by a lot so that's good
 a lot
 i'll tell you here because you don't read about that stuff
 they don't like to write that
 they don't like to write it
 they have all fake polls
 i'll tell you what the polls are worse than the writing
 actually in my opinion the polls they're suppression polls they're meant to make people discouraged even me i'm supposed to be discouraged
 and fortunately four years ago we weren't discouraged because if we would have believed the polls nobody would have voted
 the concept is really make people feel so that on election they go darling let's go out to dinner
 it's so sad about the president
 i wish he was going to win but let's go out to dinner
 then we'll come home
 let's not bother voting right
 let's not bother voting
 see it's a suppression but my people might don't get suppressed
 my people go out and vote
 my people go out and vote
 there's no suppression
 phony polls
 how about the guy
 the new york times hired this pollster this great genius
 he never called one wrong
 i don't know
 three 46

 i don't know what the hell … it's called three 40 … what's his deal
 00
 we were given a very tiny chance
 what chance did he give us
 like 9 something like that
 you know they gave him millions of dollars shortly before because he never called one wrong
 he called that one wrong
 he called that one wrong
 and this is the one … i mean i must tell you they're a little more accurate
 at least here they have us even in a lot of places
  he's even
 well we're not even we're not even
 this is going to be the greatest victory
 this is a more important election than four years ago i'll tell you more important
 because at no time before has there been a clearer choice between two parties or two visions two philosophies two agendas for the future
 there's never been anything like this
 on november 3rd nevada will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity like we had
 we had the greatest economy in the history … not of our country in the world
 we were beating everybody
 we were beating china
 remember if you go back some of you go back if you go back 10 years 15 years five years everything was … in 2019 china will overtake the united states as the largest economy
 and that didn't work out too well for them
 that didn't work out
 we were just doing leaps and bounds
 we were doing so great and then we got hit with the plague the china plague
 and we're not thrilled
 it's a disgrace
 nobody should have died
 nobody should have died
 we got hit
 the whole world got hit but they stopped it from going into the rest of china
 they stopped it from going into china but they didn't stop it from coming into the us and europe and 188 countries
 so whether or not we allow biden to impose the biggest tax increase in the history of our country 4 trillion or ban … he wants to ban energy ban american … he wants to stop fracking
 hey by the way when he was running as a democrat in the worst debate performances i've ever seen
 okay
 what do you think … he was unable to answer anything
 are you awake sir
 sir please wake up
 and who was the worst
 who treated him the worst
 kamala
 kamala
 she's another beauty
 she started off as a favorite
 she was at 15
 then she went down to 14 to 12 to 10
 she was like a dropping rock in water
 she was going down so fast
 then she went down to five and four and three two and then she said i got to get the hell out of here
 this is getting embarrassing
 and nobody treated him worse than kamala
 right
 she called him a racist
 she called him everything
 she was horrible to him
 and he says she was kamala
 she's just great
 oh yeah
 these people these people
 you're supposed to choose the people that did well
 she got out before iowa as i remember
 right
 she didn't want to run in iowa and then bernie got … again this guy is the greatest loser ever because- no no
 no he's a good sport bernie crazy bernie
 he's so crazy but he's a good sport because with hillary they really did
 do we have any young children here
 i know it's on a lot of television
 could you turn the television off just for a minute just for about three seconds
 he got screwed
 right
 okay
 now you can turn it back on
 but then they really did with this last one because if pocahontas elizabeth warren if she would have left the race one day before the big super tuesday i mean bernie would have her philosophy right
 liberals
 and i would say she'll be president
 if he ever wants she'll be president within the first month or so i would say
 i think it's just an excuse
 using him as just an excuse to get the super libs in there so they can destroy our suburbs demolish our second amendment erase your borders and indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-american lies in school
 so under my leadership we built the greatest economy in the history of the world
 and now we're doing it again
 we're doing it again
 you've seen the numbers
 and we're developing a vaccine in record time
 it will be ready before the end of the year and maybe much sooner than that
 they're very unhappy about that
 it's amazing
 we have a couple of really great experts one who's … we call him dr
 scott
 you know who i'm talking about
 he's great
 he said this is the only time … they were grilling him on television saying well the vaccine's going too fast
 you know why that's too fast
 because they don't want it to happen before the election
 he said this is the only thing in the world
 i've never seen anything like it
 everybody wants a vaccine
 and when we start getting it fast because president trump happens to be president …  and we've done this in record time years ahead of schedule
 if this was sleepy joe and obama you wouldn't have a vaccine for three years
 but listen he said this is the craziest thing
 so you're going to have a vaccine quickly
 right
 and everybody's upset about it
 so now they're trying to hurt the vaccine
 and they're trying to say as many bad … they know nothing about it but they're trying to hurt it and it's a shame
 but he said it better than anybody i've heard
 he said you're trying to hurt this country by saying bad things about the vaccine because we're going to produce it early
 it's the craziest thing
 think about it
 now having a vaccine is good but we're rounding the turn regardless
 we're rounding the turn and it's happening
 i mean it's happening
 you see
 florida is way down
 texas is now way down
 arizona governor's done a great job
 all three governors have done a great job
 and louisiana now they had a spike but they had the spike but the spike was able to be handled because now we understand
 and what we did we saved millions of lives because i hated to do it but we had to close it up understand this disease and then open up again
 and we opened but we would have had 2 million two and a half or three million people
 think of it
 we're at like around 180000
 one is too many
 one too many
 but we would've had two and a half three three and a half million people
 it would not have been acceptable would not have been sustainable
 we've done an incredible job
 and these people that have done it with me the ventilators the vaccines the therapeutics these people … i mean the hospitals the beds that we built the ships that we sent to new york the ships that we sent
 to have an ungrateful governor in new york cuomo to have an ungrateful governor
 we sent him ships
 we sent them ships
 we sent them
 we built a convention center with 2800 beds and he didn't use the beds for senior citizens
 he hardly used the beds at all
 he hardly used the ships at all
 he said we did a phenomenal job and now he gets political
 he wants to get political with me
 a real wise guy but that's okay
 you got to see what they are doing between him and de blasio
 that's a beauty
 what they've done to my beautiful city
 i love that city so much
 what they've done is so horrible
 the highest taxes in the land crime all over the place
 they're like 300 up in crime
 we need rudy to come out of retirement
 but we're defeating the china virus
 when biden was vice president he was a complete disaster on the swine flu which was a much easier thing to handle
 joe biden's own chief of staff said that when biden managed swine flu in 2009 they quote did every possible thing wrong
 this is the guy that worked for him in charge of the swine flu
 and 60 million americans got h1n1 in a period of time
 and it's just purely a … he said it was just … we were lucky
 he said it's just lucky that there weren't great mass casualties
 different kinds of a disease a little bit
 and what he said is amazing
 he said we did nothing right
 this is the man that's going to tell us all about building ventilators
 you think joe is going to be able to build thousands of ventilators a month
 which now we're doing and sending them to all these countries all over the world who have no hope of building ventilators and they need them badly
 so it's an amazing thing
 the outbreak was so rampant that obama-biden the administration told states to stop testing immediately and they ordered the cdc to stop counting cases because they looked like hell okay
 we didn't do that
 by the way the reason we show so many cases because we have the best testing program in the world by far by far
 biden's record demonstrates that if he had been in charge when the china virus arrived hundreds of thousands of more americans would have died
 as vice president he presided over the worst and the weakest and the slowest economic recovery since the great depression
 you've heard that before
 it was the most pathetic recovery since the depression
 no state was hit harder by biden's failure than nevada
 and i was out here and that right about that
 you got hit hard
 this is not the guy you want
 but biden wants to raise your taxes so high
 he would eradicate your economy
 he'd put on new regulations and it wouldn't be him again
 i'm going to keep saying it
 it will be the people that control him
 he's a puppet
 and then he wants to do a complete shutdown
 we're setting records
 we just set a job record for four months 10
4 million people
 listen to this
 so when we had this pandemic worldwide look it's a terrible thing that a thing like this happened
 people were saying we could go to 41 42 unemployment
 you know what we are now
 8
4
 i don't say that's … if you would have said that … and we have the strongest highest stock market in history so your 401ks are doing great
 if he got in we would have the greatest depression in the history of our country
 i mean it
 i think 1929 would look like good times
 all right
 because he'd do everything wrong
 he'd raise your taxes
 he'd raised the hell out of interest rates
 he'd do everything wrong
 the biden shutdown will permanently destroy the lives and dreams of tens of millions of americans inflict totally lasting harm on our children and lead countless deaths from suicide
 don't forget when you do these shutdowns your state is shut down
 you got a governor
 you shut down except if you have a riot
 you're not shut down for riots
 riots you can have they can burn the hell out of the strip
 they can burn the hell out of reno
 they can do whatever the hell they want if it's a riot
 but if you want to go to church you can't do it
 if you want to be in a group of people you can't do it
 but there's a lot of harm done on the other side
 there's a lot of tremendous harm done
 remember the cure can't be worse
 remember that
 and on the other side drugs suicide depression substance abuse of different kinds heart disease
 you have tremendous problems on the other side
 open your schools open up
 we got to open up this state
 and i guarantee you … and by the way the states that are open are doing really well
 they're doing much better than the ones that are closed
 i don't know if you've been seeing the numbers
 and this is just arithmetic
 the states that are open are doing great
 the states that are closed north carolina what he's doing to that great state he's got it locked down shut down
 michigan what she's doing
 and we're trying to get big 10 football by the way but we won't even
 michigan what she's doing to michigan is unbelievable
 take a look at what they're doing to pennsylvania
 and here's another governor in charge of millions of ballots
 so i'm going to win pennsylvania but what's he going to do with these ballots
 where are they going
 who are they sending
 who's sending it back
 who's signing
 they don't even have to have an authorized signature in nevada
 do you know that
 they don't have to have … you don't have to have an authorized signature on a ballot
 no
 they're trying to rig an election and we can't let that happen
 i hope you're all going to be poll-watchers i hope you are because with you people watching the polls it's going to be pretty hard to cheat
 i'll tell you i wouldn't want to be a cheater
 they'll figure a way
 no they are
 it's a very dangerous thing
 it's a very dangerous thing and i totally mean it
 and i've been at it
 and you see people
 and by the way it's not even politics
 it's common sense
 they said millions of ballots
 people are getting ballots
 people died and they're getting ballots
 they're sending them to dogs
 you see that
 dogs got ballot
 everybody's getting ballots
 probably everybody but republican are going to get the ballots
 right
 and they're unsolicited
 so when you say solicited because i like solicited better as a word than absentee
 absentee nobody knows what the hell it's supposed to represent
 it's not really a good definition
 one is solicited where you ask … you solicit the ballot
 you want it you sign papers
 they send it to you
 you send it back
 it's okay
 it's good
 but unsolicited where they take millions of ballots
 so what happens
 i happen to think the postal people are great but what happens if one of the post guys before he gives the ballots he takes a whole handful and hands them to some democrat political operative right
 and so he hands him a thousand ballots and the guy doesn't even have to … you don't have to have verification to do that
 now here's the good news
 we're in front of a court
 and hopefully the court's going to rule because this is the greatest scam in the history of presidential politics
 these people are … they've gone crazy
 biden and his party of liberal hypocrites want to lock law-abiding americans in their homes which is what they're doing
 and they want to keep them out of church
 they really do
 they're fighting god they're fighting guns and they're fighting oil
 think of it
 i don't think they'll do too well in texas
 did you see where they said
 we think the race will be quite close in texas but the president has an edge
 listen i'm in favor of oil and energy
 i'm in favor of religion and god
 okay
 and i'm in favor of our great second amendment guns
 so he's against our second amendment
 okay you know who he'd put in charge
 beto beto
 or as he says is beto beto
 so when beto was legit and then ted cruz beat him and ted did a very good job
 i tell you he did a great job
 but beto went totally south
 he's gone crazy
 so he now is a big gun guy
 he wants to take guns away from everybody
 so who did biden put in charge
 beto
 remember beto was interviewed in some magazine or third-rate magazine most of them are but remember
 and beto said this was at the beginning before he got beat to hell
 i said he thought this was easy didn't he
 but remember when beto said i was born for this
 as soon as i hear somebody's born for running for president i said he's out
 that's the end of him
 nobody's born for this
 this is tough stuff
 i had a great life i'll tell you
 my life was so beautiful
 what the hell did i do this for
 but you know what
 you know what
 we are doing things that nobody's ever done before
 and i say it all the time and that's what makes me happy
 we're dealing with very sick and very bad and evil people
 but i'll tell you no administration in three-and-a-half years no administration has done what we've done in the first three-and-a-half years
 but they want to punish you for praying in church while they let agitators and arsonists burn your churches down
 look at washington
 they want to burn the churches down and that's fine
 but you want to go pray in church they won't let you do that
 just last week biden proudly accepted the endorsement of pro-criminal anti-police portland district attorney who has a policy of releasing rioters vandals criminals and violent extremists without any charges
 no charges
 never saw anything
 by the way all of these places were talking about are democrat- run chicago new york portland seattle
 the only reason seattle got settled because they knew we were going in
 we told them we're going in tomorrow morning
 we're going to open it up
 we're going to take it
 it would have taken us 20 minutes
 so they sent people that night because they didn't want to be embarrassed
 but look at what we've done
 and so every place we've touched we solved the crime but they have to ask us
 if they don't ask us we're not supposed to do it but maybe we do it anyway
 and it usually takes anywhere from 25 minutes to … and it usually takes anywhere from 25 minutes to about one hour
 wasn't that a beautiful sight though in minneapolis right
 they're burning the poor city down
 i love that state
 i think we have a chance of winning in that state first time in many years for a republican
 they're burning minneapolis
 you don't think of minneapolis that way right
 you don't think of it
 the city is burning down
 you have this fake cnn reporter what's his name
 velshi the nice shaved head
 maybe i should try that should i try that
 no i don't think …  donald trump went down substantially in the polls like about 40
 he showed up with a new haircut it's called the shave head
 ali velshi
 and remember he said no this is a friendly protest
 it's a friendly protest
 and it's really quite nice
 and people are throwing bottles at him he's being hit with tear gas
 this is a friendly protest
 and you look over his shoulder and the entire city was burning
 do you remember the scene
 the thing looked like it was 30 blocks it was just burning
 and he's talking about this is all fake news and nobody would have known
 i knew it before i did it but i never knew it to this extent
 i never knew it to this extent
 it is corrupt
 it's fake and they shouldn't be allowed to do it
 they shouldn't be allowed
 these are far left lunatics that biden selects to staff his government
 there are policies biden's pledged to apply nationwide
 you're going to have the suburbs they have a plan
 it doesn't matter it's a regulation very horrible regulation for the … does anybody live in the suburbs
 because if you don't vote for trump in the suburbs okay
 women that live in the suburbs
 they say oh they don't like donald trump
 i said i think they do
 remember last time remember it's the same thing
 no it's the same thing
 remember last time four years ago donald trump will not do well with women
 i said why am i so bad
 donald trump will not … and then the votes started coming in
 he's doing very well jim with women i don't know what's going on
 we did very well with women
 we did well with everybody we did well with everybody
 but they have a regulation
 and ben carson was fantastic the head of hud
 i said ben they're going to destroy the suburbs
 and they wanted corey booker to head that program
 but the program was already doing damage
 they were playing with the zoning so they could build projects in the suburb projects in the suburbs
 and i said we're going to end it
 somebody said sir let's just amend it
 i said nope we got to end it
 end it i want to end it
 i don't want to have a lesser version
 but if he gets in they will open up that whole program
 they're going to open it up on steroids
 they're going to open it up to a level that you wouldn't have believed possible
 and he will drive you out of the suburbs
 he will drive you out of the … he'll drive you out of everything
 they're open up their … i call it the suburban destruction program because that's what they've done
 and it's been a horrible program
 it's been very unfair to people with the american dream
 and let me just tell you something
 30 of the people that live in the suburbs are minorities
 they're hispanic they're black they're asian it's the american dream
 and they want the american dream and they don't want that to happen
 that's why i'm doing so well with african american with asian american with hispanic american and with women
 but don't let them ruin the suburbs because they will put that regulation back immediately immediately
 and don't let them ruin the suburbs because the suburbs are a special place
 the suburbs are the american dream
 that's where everyone aspires to and that includes minorities and everybody
 don't let them ruin the suburbs
 and with that comes tremendous crime
 and i was talking the other day darling somebody just moved next door
 who is it
 it's a representative of antifa
 she will look at her husband say darling we're out of here
 we're out of here
 antifa
 remember they were trying to blame other people
 they don't like to mention the name antifa
 i said it's antifa and i was right
 i was right
 they're bad people
 and you know what they have to pay a price for the damage and for the horror that they've caused they have to pay a price
 and it's so easy
 it's so easy
 a lot of them now are wealthy
 they're like these wealthy spoiled kids that have no clue about life
 they've got arms that are about this big but they were heavy jackets with lots … and you look and you say oh that guy looks tough
 and then the jacket comes off and you see these two little … and they go home and they live in a basement too their mom and dad's basement
 but biden's plan is to appease domestic terrorists and my plan is to arrest domestic terrorists
 joe biden is a weak person
 he does whatever his left wing puppet masters demand you know that
 look joe doesn't know what's going on you know that
 i mean let's be nice about it okay
 and i'm being nice when i say it
 he'll never be able to protect your family your loved ones or your community
 if biden's elected his radical supporters won't just cause mayhem on the streets like you're seeing all democrats
 we could solve it so fast
 chicago a few weekends think of it 72 people shot this is shot
 somebody said you mean with bullets
 i said yeah with bullets
 18 people died
 now we're pulling our troops out of afghanistan out of iraq you see what's happening
 but let me tell you but we don't … there's nothing like that over there
 they don't have 18 people killed or 12 people in a short period of time
 well you have 70 people shot where you have another weekend where they had i think a few weekends ago 38 people have been shot in chicago
 i said 38
 it's not even believable
 and now when these people say it they make it … they try and play it down
 and you're sitting there i said did i just see 38 people were shot
 it's just a terrible thing
 and it could all be stopped
 it could all be stopped so quickly
 but they have to respect law and they have to have order
 law and order
 but these radical lefts will be running the department of justice the department of homeland security and the united states supreme court
 and you see what's going on there
 if we don't … the next president hopefully it's going to be us not me us but the next president is going to have one two three or four supreme court justice
 it's just you know just that time right
 just that time going to be a minimum of one i would say but it will be a one two three or four
 and that's going to change the whole makeup of the supreme court
 that's going to take away your guns
 that's going to destroy your second amendment
 that's going to change the whole rationale thinking on so many different subjects like you wouldn't believe including by the way life okay
 life pro-life anybody pro-life here
 no this is going to change the makeup of this country for 50 years
 i don't know that the country will survive 50 years if that happens it might not survive five years if that happens
 but the next president and you saw i put out a list of an additional number of very conservative highly thought of highly respected judges
 and they are the only people that i will pick
 meaning the first list the second list it's about 44 45 people
 they are the only people that i will consider for the supreme court of the united states
 and i'm asking joe biden to do the same thing but he can't because he's got a bunch of radical left maniacs that they want to put on the court
 and nobody can get elected not even with democrats rational democrats will they vote for some of these people to be on
 so far he's refused to do it
 i'm probably forcing him tonight to do something but he should put out a list of his judges so that you know where you stand
 biden supports cutting police funding you know that abolishing … and by the way did you see we just got chicago police today endorsed trump
 that's not easy to do
 chicago
 new york's finest new york's finest endorse florida ohio texas
 we have everybody
 is there a police officer in the country if there is they'll do a commercial
 this officer loves sleepy joe biden he's so tough on crime
 so biden's been going down very rapidly in the polls
 and now what he's doing is he's playing tough guy that he's tough on crime
 and all of a sudden he goes from demolished demolish and defund okay
 but he goes from let's not give the police any money
 let's not even say defund for him
 his people want to defund the police
 they actually have places seattle they actually don't want to have police
 minneapolis they don't want to have police
 they don't want to have police
 what's going to happen
 you saw the commercial we put up
 a woman's being murdered
 i'm sorry
 we cannot take your call right now
 we will call you back within the next 24 hours
 a woman's being raped right
 i'm sorry
 we could not respond right now because we have been defunded but we will try getting there within the next week
 this is what you're going to have
 i mean that was a strong commercial
 it had a big impact but this is what you're buying with a guy like this
 this guy you're going to have portland's all over this country
 and we can't allow that to happen
 not here he says not here in nevada
 well with your governor it could happen here too i can tell
 they want to abolish bail
 so they want to abolish cash bail like they did in new york
 they release people the horrible criminals in new york they release them no cash bail
 and he calls law enforcement biden called law enforcement the enemy
 they're not the enemy
 they're our friends
 they're our great friends
 and without them we wouldn't be here
 here in nevada rioters burned the city hall in reno
 does anybody know that
 do you know that
 that's not a pleasant sight
 how did you allow that to happen
 i would've thought you people would've gotten out there like you're not going to burn our city hall
 and during the violent demonstrations in las vegas a 29- year-old police officer you know about this was deliberately shot in the head while he was doing his job a vicious criminal left he was a left person a left
 he was a real left all right
 and the the young officer as you know he's a young brilliant young guy and he's totally paralyzed
 unlike biden while i'm president of the united states i will always stand with the heroes of our law enforcement
 and on november 3rd you will save america
 you're talking about saving america
 we cannot let this happen to our country
 because i don't know if you can ever come back from what will happen including our supreme court
 we're joined tonight by our terrific republican congressional nominee who has my complete and total endorsement

 and also here are several really great members of a terrific association and they like trump a lot the nevada trucking association
 where are they nevada trucking
 nevada trucking thank you thank you
 thank you fellas thank you very much
 great job we appreciate it very much
 those roads are going to get very nice
 they're already starting
 tonight our hearts are with all of the communities in the west battling devastating wildfires
 i'm going there the day after tomorrow
 i'm staying in your state tonight but i'm going to be going to california
 spoke to the folks in oregon washington they never had anything like this but it is about forest management
 please remember the words very simple forest management please remember
 it's about forest management and other things but forest management
 my administration is closely coordinating with state and local leaders and we want to thank the more than 200000 people that are working on it and 28000 firefighters and first responders who courageously and bravely are fighting out there
 they are fighting and it's dangerous it's dangerous
 it's rapidly spreading hundreds of thousands of acres it's not been anything quite like this one
 we spent the last four years reversing the horrible damage joe biden inflicted over the past 47 years
 think of it he's been there 47 years
 and he always says well why didn't you do this
 why did … the guy just really in all fairness i've been here three and a half years
 so it's not like they haven't been here
 he was a vice president for eight years and he only did one thing good
 he treated obama good
 i was going to say something else but they would have scolded me
 that's exactly what i was going to say but i didn't
 it's better than you say it
 do you want to shout it out
 go ahead shout
 that's what i said that's what i was … thank you very … this can only happen in nevada
 and we pass record tax cuts and regulation cuts to keep the family farms and ranches in the family
 nobody even knows this
 we virtually eliminated the unfair estate tax also known as the death tax
 does anyone have a small farm medium-sized farm or business
 anybody
 if you want to leave it to your children you don't have to pay tax now because of trump
 i always say it and i mean it if you like your children it's great
 if you don't like your children it doesn't mean a damn thing don't leave it to them
 i ended the administrations … and if you look at that last administration what they were doing on american energy what they were doing and now we are the world's number one energy producer by far and we are energy independent
 how about your gas prices
 that's not too bad right
 you didn't think you'd ever see those prices those under two dollar prices did you
 thank you president trump i appreciate it sir
 biden has pledged to abolish the production of american oil and shale and clean coal and natural gas and he wants to ban fracking right
 so he's in these debates with the other people and they're just eating him alive
 he did his best debate against crazy bernie and i got to ask why did he get better all of a sudden
 what happened
 why do you have any idea why
 i think i know
 why did he get better all of a sudden
 but he did his last event but he was so bad
 and he raised his hand no fracking
 there will be no fracking under my administration he said
 and you know why i add the word he said because they will take what i said and they will put it as a commercial
 there will be no fracking under my administration they'll have me saying that
 that's how dishonest these people are
 so i always have to add something because … but even then sometimes they'll cut it off at the end
 but he said there'll be no fracking under my administration
 now all of a sudden he goes to pennsylvania and his polls aren't looking very good because they do big fracking
 and he goes to texas and he goes to oklahoma and he goes to north dakota and he goes to all these places
 it's not looking so good
 all of a sudden he says i have nothing against fracking
 what are you talking about
 but always follow their first instinct because the first instinct is what is going to happen
 and he has to because he signed … he has a manifesto
 i call it the manifesto with bernie and aoc plus three all these crazy people
 and it's a manifesto and it reads far worse than anything bernie sanders ever said
 i thought he'd take what bernie did and move them somewhat to the right
 no he took what bernie said and they moved way further left
 it's the craziest thing i've ever seen
 but follow the original statements because that's what's going to happen
 and they cannot … you know solar i like solar but solar is very expensive and it doesn't have the power to fire up our massive plants
 we have big plants including in this great state and you can't fire them up with this stuff
 you can't fire it
 we need the strength because we're competing against a lot of nations and they don't go through what we do
 they don't care about the air and they should and they should which is another problem
 i took you out of that crazy paris climate accord because it was totally disaster
 no it was a way of hurting the united states
 i tell you we would have had a close 20 25 of our factories in order to even … it was so crazy so expensive but i took you out
 i was surprised people most people they appreciate what i did
 because you think it was easy doing that
 it was actually i thought it would be devastating
 i got one day of bad press after that everybody forgot about it
 it wasn't that bad
 but i did the right thing for our country and we want to have our great plants working
 we want to have our great plants fired up
 they said manufacturing jobs are dead right
 sleepy joe said i'm going to bring back manufacturing
 really
 well obama said you'd need a miracle to bring back manufacturing
 i brought back 650000 jobs
 he said you'd need a miracle
 and now sleepy joe is saying that no no no
 i've got to bring back … he's not going to bring back anything
 i made history by signing an executive order making the official policy of the united states government to buy american and to hire american
 now i did this long time ago
 and then i see a sign in front of joe right here right here it said buy american
 oh great joe thanks joe
 where have you been for 47 years
 because for 47 years joe biden did the opposite
 he crushed the dreams of american workers and enriched foreign countries
 that's how china happened
 hey look what i've done
 i've taken billions tens of billions of dollars out of china
 nobody else did it before me i mean no other president
 in all fairness in all fairness to obama and biden i call him obiden because it's easier obiden
 in all fairness to obiden i mean they didn't do any of that
 but now i see buy american
 hey he also copied on the pandemic
 did you see he copied everything i was doing
 except one thing he wouldn't have closed the country to china so hundreds of thousands of people would have died from that
 but two months two and a half months later he admitted that i was right
 thank you very much joe i appreciate it
 and yesterday he made i think he made a mistake
 well what do you think the usmca what's better that or nafta
 well no the usmca is better
 was that jake tapper
 i like jake tapper was that … i don't think he was doing … i don't think he likes me too much but that's okay
 they said what's better they said what's better
 he goes usmca
 well that's the deal that trump made
 oh it is
 oh
 that's a great deal we made
 we took the horrible nafta deal
 we got rid of the nafta
 we got rid of tpp
 we got rid of that terrible terrible south korea deal which hillary clinton said will produce 250000 jobs
 she said this will produce 200 … she made it
 hillary crooked hillary
 she made it no wait she said it's going to produce 250000 jobs
 and she was 100 right it produced 250000 jobs for south korea not for us
 it produced 250000 jobs for south korea
 not for us
 south korea did very well with that deal but i changed that deal a lot
 that's now a good deal
 earlier this year i kept my promise to american workers
 when we ended the nafta nightmare and signed the brand new usmca mexico-canada agreement into law
 you're not going to see companies leaving for mexico very much anymore
 they're not going to be leaving your community going to mexico making a product selling the product back in not being taxed at the border
 doesn't work that way anymore
 it's probably the biggest reason i ran for president if you want to know that… and these stupid endless wars
 i saved the uni-… but that's one of the reasons washington doesn't like me
 they love those endless wars
 you got to ask them why
 do you ever watch where they're very critical of me
 i mean we don't like him on foreign policy
 really
 look what i've done
 look what i've done
 israel… we're signing deals all over the place
 these guys that are lecturing all the time they don't have a clue
 they're clueless
 they were clueless
 that's why for 40 years you got nothing except blood in the sand
 that's all you got
 blood in the sand
 i saved the us auto industry by withdrawing from last administration's job-killing trans-pacific partnership
 i took the toughest ever action to stand up to china's rampant theft of american jobs
 they don't like me too much
 joe biden's agenda is made in china
 my agenda is made in the usa
 that's the way
 for the last four years i've been delivering for our incredible hispanic… i love a hispanic community
 oh there was a poll today
 did you see it
 did you see the poll
 oh this was a biggie
 they had a poll today that with the hispanic voter they call them latino hispanic
 they use different terms
 to me i just loved the people
 i don't care but let me just… did you see it
 trump is leading biden with the hispanic community
 trump is leading biden
 well hispanics like tough people
 they like people that are going to produce jobs
 they like… and by the way the hispanics understand the border better than anybody else
 they're better than anybody else
 no but we're being… you know it's unusual that a republican would be leading a democrat not… it's habit
 you know what the problem is it's habit
 but the hispanics get it
 and we're leading with the hispanic community
 and that's because you had the lowest job numbers in the history of our country
 you had the best home ownership
 every statistic was the best
 and now we're doing it again except we're doing it very rapidly
 remember 8
4
 we could have been at 44 if stupid people ran it 8
4
 i'm fighting for school choice safe neighborhoods low taxes and regulations on hispanic-owned small businesses
 we're fighting
 you know the hispanic-owned small businesses they're great business people
 i know it from being in business
 they were very tough
 they were great business people and they get it
 they get it like very few people get it
 i'm also standing up for religious liberty
 joe biden would be… so joe biden would be a disaster for all communities not just the hispanic communities pledged to wage attacks on catholic organizations like the little sisters of the poor that we're helping
 and we're winning with them
 we're helping them
 they got hit so hard by oh biden
 they got hit so hard
 i remember them in the supreme court the little sisters of the poor
 they get hit by biden
 and then he says how wonderful
 he's such a wonderful person
 he supports taxpayer-funded extreme late-term abortion
 and i mean ninth month ninth month ninth month
 and he'd allow violent mobs to burn down your business
 and he would hand your country over to the socialists
 but i believe it's worse than socialists
 i do
 i think it's a step worse than socialist
 and it starts with a c
 that is why we're going to win a record share of the hispanic vote in november
 so important
 thank you
 thank you
 thank you
 thank you
 it's so important
 we're bringing it back very fast
 i think next year is… next year i believe will be as good or better than the year we had last year
 unless somebody comes in and decides to quadruple your taxes then i can't
 then all bets are off but we're going to have… we're lowering taxes
 he's raising taxes
 we're going to have tremendous growth
 joe biden's party continues to attack our incredible border agents
 they're incredible people more than half of whom happen to be hispanic-americans
 did you know that
 i know all of them
 jose how you doing
 juan how you doing
 every sixth time i'd say hello jim how are you
 these extraordinary patriots deserve our admiration gratitude and respect not joe biden's contempt
 he's got contempt for these people that are so great and brave
 that's a tough job
 my administration's achieved the most secure border in american history
 we ended the catch and release disaster
 remember you'd catch somebody what's your name
 i don't know
 what's your address
 i don't know
 okay
 go into our country
 that's okay
 you couldn't arrest anybody
 we ended it stopped asylum fraud and we've deported over 20000 gang members including ms13 and over a half a million criminal illegal aliens
 now think about it
 think of that number
 think if you at a half a million people spread throughout the country that were criminal illegal aliens
 some of these are very violent people and we get them the hell out
 we're stopping human trafficking protecting the victims most of whom are women most of whom are women
 human trafficking because of the internet that's a tremendously big and horrible business
 these are the worst human beings of all
 but most of the victims are women children to a much lesser extent but women and human traffickers
 and you know what made it that way is the internet
 who would think
 it almost sounds like an ancient crime
 it's not
 it's very modern because of the internet because of the computer
 and it's a horrible thing and we've stopped so much of it
 we have an incredible group of people that go after these animals
 and we built now over 320 miles of border wall and are adding 10 new miles a week
 and the wall will very soon be finished
 it'll be finished
 we've invested 2
5 trillion in the us military
 we've rebuilt our depleted… it was a depleted military
 now we have the newest we have the best we've ever had and launched the first new branch of the united states armed forces in nearly 75 years the us space force
 and we did things that people said couldn't be done
 after 52 years we passed va choice in va accountability and 91 of our veterans now approve of their va care
 they think it's doing great
 the fact is i did more in 47 months as president than joe biden did in 47 years
 it's true
 it's true
 i withdrew from last administration's disastrous iran nuclear deal
 we killed the founder and leader of isis al-baghdadi
 we eliminated the world's number one terrorist and mass murderer of american troops qasem soleimani
 he's dead
 he's gone
 biden voted for the iraq war
 he opposed the mission to take out osama bin laden
 he opposed killing soleimani
 he oversaw the rise of isis and he cheered the rise of china as a very positive development
 oh really
 tell me about it
 tell me about it
 not too positive
 joe biden has been on the wrong side of history for 47 years
 in fact the secretary of state secretary of defense said about him he's never called it right
 he never called it right
 if we had listened to joe hundreds of thousands more americans would right now have died
 when the virus arrived we launched the largest national mobilization since world war ii
 you know that especially with ventilators and equipment and masks and shields
 we're delivering life-saving therapies that have achieved among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country in the world
 and you don't hear that from the fake news
 europe's excess mortality rate is 24 higher
 and these are statistics that come from people that do this stuff right
 this is not done by my secretary
 24 higher than the united states and despite their punitive lockdowns they're once again seeing a spike
 they're seeing a big spike in cases over there
 they did the heavy lockdowns just like you're doing right here
 and they're seeing a spike
 and there's no reason for that
 the united states has experienced the smallest contraction of any major western nation
 think of that
 and by far the fastest recovery
 and if they wrote about it properly it would be a proper thing a proper thing to do
 through our historic relief programs we've saved more than half a trillion nevada cops and jobs and all of this yet
 so many people going out
 we've saved 42000 nevada businesses
 think of that
 biden would terminate this comeback
 he wants to end it
 he would terminate this comeback
 he would put your families in danger
 he will totally destroy social security
 and in my opinion if you look at what he's going to do to medicare they will destroy social security
 they will
 you called it
 you know what you're talking about
 exactly right
 he's going to massively raise your taxes
 reimpose crippling federal regulations destroy your social security and destroy protections for pre-existing conditions
 he's going to destroy that and decimate your 401ks and retirement savings and stocks
 your stocks are going to go down like you never saw anything go down before
 he'll obliterate your second amendment
 he'll give you… and he would he would give free… he wants to give free healthcare to illegal aliens that will bankrupt medicare
 he wants to give… you saw him raise his hand
 remember the debate where they're all standing there and he looked around who's going to give free healthcare to illegal aliens
 and everyone's raising hands
 he's going oh… now take a look
 i'm not kidding
 it's sad
 it's pathetic
 he would end our travel bans on jihadist regions and increase refugee admissions 700 opening the flood gates to terror-afflicted nations
 you understand that
 he'll establish a national sanctuary city policy for criminal illegal aliens
 he loves sanctuary cities meaning the people that control him love sanctuary cities
 biden pledges to oppose school choice
 and he has stated that if he is elected charter schools are gone
 they're gone
 in the second term and we've already started it very heavily i will provide school choice to every parent in america
 a vote for republicans is a vote for safe communities great jobs and a limitless future for all americans
 instead of letting washington change us despite all that we've been through and we've been through more than any president has ever been through with these characters and they're falling one after another
 but you do notice that i hope
 one after another
 oh i see the phones have been wiped out
 i wonder what that's all about but that's a criminal thing you did
 we are changing washington
 we are changing washington
 never forget that they're coming after me because i am fighting for you
 and it's true
 over the next four years to conclude we will make america into the manufacturing superpower of the world
 and we will end our reliance on china once and for all
 we will make our medical supplies right here in the united states
 we will rapidly return to full employment soaring economies and a record prosperity even greater than last year
 we will hire more police increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement surge federal prosecutors into high crime communities and ban sanctuary cities
 we will appoint prosecutors judges justices and believe… we will believe in enforcing the law
 we want law and order
 we have to have it
 we will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race color religion and creed
 we will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life
 we will uphold religious liberty free speech and the right to keep and bear arms
 we will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep america out of endless foreign wars
 and we are bringing our troops home as we speak tonight
 we will maintain america's unrivaled military might and we will ensure peace through strength
 we will end surprise medical billing require price transparency
 it's already signed starts on january 1st
 i don't want anyone to… i know ours is a big deal
 i don't want sleepy joe to take care of… can you imagine
 i'll be watching
 prices have dropped substantially all throughout the country because of price… and i'm the one that got it done
 and he'll say what did i do
 what did i do
 how did this happen
 and we'll further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs
 we just did favored nations
 we're going to come down to the lowest price anywhere in the world because we did a favored nations clause
 you know what that is
 we will… the drug companies don't exactly like me too much
 they're spending millions of dollars on negative commercials
 please understand when you see those commercials it means your drug prices are coming down
 we will strongly protect medicaid and social security which they will give up
 and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions and america will land the first woman on the moon and the united states will be the first nation to land an astronaut on mars
 we will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools
 and we will teach our children to love our country honor our history and always respect our great american flag
 and we will live by the timeless words of our national motto in god we trust
 for years you had a president who apologized for america
 now you have a president who is standing up for america and standing up for the people of nevada
 so very importantly get your friends get your family get your neighbors get your coworkers and get out and vote on november 3rd
 from carson city to elko from las vegas to reno and from clark county to right here in douglas county we stand on the shoulders of red-blooded american patriots who poured out their heart sweat and soul to secure our liberty
 they want to secure our liberty
 think of it and defend our freedom
 nevada was founded by pioneers and prospectors miners and cowboys innovators and trailblazers tough people great people who tamed the frontier raised up the mighty hoover dam lit up the brilliant lights of the vegas strip and transformed a sprawling desert into a shining oasis
 so true
 our american ancestors made this into the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth
 and we are making it greater than it ever has been
 we are making it greater than ever before
 we are making it greater than it's ever been
 proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country
 we are returning power to you the american people
 with your help your devotion and your drive we are going to keep on working
 we're going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning winning winning
 we are one movement one people one family and one glorious nation under god
 and together with the incredible people of nevada we will make america wealthy again
