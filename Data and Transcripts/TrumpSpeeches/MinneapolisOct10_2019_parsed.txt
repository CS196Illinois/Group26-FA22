thank you very much
 thank you minnesota
 this is a great state
 we are going to win this state in a very short period of time
 thank you
 this feels like the day before the election
 so we have 20000-plus people inside
 we just set a new record
 and we have 25000 people that we still love outside
 and close to 100000 people wanted to come tonight
 thank you all
 this is great
 this is really great
 thank you
 i want to thank our great vice president mike pence and karen pence for being here tonight
 it is great to be back in the twin cities with the freedom-loving american patriots who make our country run
 you know that
 you know it
 for the next 13 months think of that it seems like yesterday for the next 13 months we are going to fight with all of our heart and soul and we are going to win the great state of minnesota in 2020
 america now has the number one economy anywhere in the world and it's not even close
 you know i'm dealing with china right now
 they're in washington
 we're going to see if we make a deal
 but they want to make it
 we're going to determine whether or not we want to make it
 but they've been very nice
 and today i got a call from one of the top representatives he said congratulations mr
 president on having a truly great great economy
 that's pretty nice
 we picked up since the election trillions of dollars in value
 and china has lost trillions of dollars in value
 i will say this if our opponent had won that election you know what would have happened
 right now china would become the … it would be the number one economy anywhere in the world
 and right now i can tell you they're not even close
 our country is stronger than ever before because we are proudly putting for the first time in a long time we are putting america first
  cops love trump trump loves cops
 our bold pursuit of this pro-american agenda has enraged and you know what's happened it's enraged the failed ruling class in washington
 not easy to get them out but we're doing it slowly but surely
 these corrupt politicians and the radical leftists got rich bleeding america dry
 and they knew that my election would finally end their pillaging and looting of our country
 and that's what they were doing
 and that's what they continue to try and do
 that is why from day one the wretched washington swamp has been trying to nullify the results of a truly great and democratic election the election of 2016
 they're trying
 they're not getting very far
 they want to erase your vote like it never existed
 they want to erase your voice
 and they want to erase your future
 but they will fail because in america the people rule again
 do you remember that just 19 minutes after i raised my hand and took the oath of office the washington post a terrible newspaper that doesn't know how to write the truth published a story and in this case they might've gotten it pretty correct they said the campaign to impeach president trump has begun
 that was the headline
 little did we know they weren't playing games
 think of that
 that was 19 minutes after the oath of office
 months earlier peter strzok remember he and his lover lisa page
 what a group
 she's going to win 10 million to one
 she's going to win
 i'm telling you peter
 i'm telling you peter she's going to win
 peter
 oh i love you so much
 i love you peter
 i love you too lisa
 lisa i love you
 lisa lisa oh god i love you lisa
 and if she doesn't win lisa we've got an insurance policy lisa
 we'll get that son of a bitch out
 we got an insurance policy
 and we're living through the insurance policy
 that's what it is
 the phony russia hoax
  lisa i love you
 now the do-nothing democrat con artists and scammers are getting desperate
 13 months they got to move fast because they're not beating us at the polls and they know it despite the phony polls that you see all the time their phony polls
 you know polls are no different
 remember i always used to talk about polls i know polls very well
 polls are no different than crooked writers
 they're crooked polls
 they're crooked polls
 no different
 boy that's a lot of media
 look back there
 that's a lot of media
 they are so dishonest
 and frankly they are so bad for our country
 they are so bad
 and they could be so good for our country
 they could be so good
 and maybe they'll change and maybe they won't
 i've been waiting for a long time
 after i won the last election i said finally it's okay
 finally i'll get some great press
 they got worse
 they got worse
 i said finally we're going to get … i said to the first lady darling we're going to finally get respect
 we're going to finally get media and press coverage
 it's going to be great
 look at what we've done
 and i'm telling you they did they got worse
 they know they cannot win
 you understand
 well if you didn't understand honestly there's no way anybody could win because you'd believe them
 if you believe them there's no way anybody could … because it's like 94 … i can do the greatest things in history and they'll make them bad to very bad
 and if i do a neutral something neutral it worked out okay not great it's like give him the electric chair
 that was terrible
 right
 no this is the worst
 these people and the democrats they're partners
 it's a partnership
 how about on the newscast like the word manufactured it's manu… and every newscast tonight in a manufactured deal along the border … the word's never been used … all of a sudden every newscast is using it
 it's a talking point given to these fakers by the democrats
 so they know they can't win the 2020 election so they're pursuing the insane impeachment witch hunt
 i've been going through it now for more time than i've been in office
 because like strzok with his insurance deal this was before remember this this was before that statement was made months before i took office
 that statement was made months before the election took place
 they said just in case we're going to have an insurance policy
 that only means one thing we're going to get him out
 so they're telling us
 we can't let that ever happen again to another president
 and rush limbaugh sean hannity a lot of people the great mark levin
 we have a lot of great people
 lou dobbs great people
 you know what they said
 every one of them plus many others there's no other man that we've ever met that could have taken it
 it's true
 maybe i'm a little different up here
 i don't know
 but i enjoy it
 to me i'm energized because we're draining the swamp
 the democrats' brazen attempt to overthrow our government will produce a backlash at the ballot box the likes of which they have never ever seen before in the history of this country
 these are bad people
 my phone call as an example with the president of ukraine was perfect
 everybody that looked at it
 and the only reason i released it was that the democrats put out a phony narrative
 so i had no choice
 and i don't want to do that as president every time a president from a country calls me or i call them we have to release the text
 how can you do business that way
 who's going to want to speak to your president
 so the president of ukraine reiterated today at a major news conference on other subjects that he was under absolutely no pressure
 he doesn't even know what they're talking about
 and he used the word there was no blackmail during this call
 he used that term
 so in theory that should be the end of it
 think of it a president of the united states who's made our economy with a lot of help from all of you frankly but from mike and from some of our great senators and some of our great people that we have with us we made this the strongest economy in our history
 we've rebuilt our military
 we're taking care of healthcare like nobody's been able to do
 what we've done is incredible
 and by the way we're protecting your second amendment
 if you don't have me your second amendment is gone
 so we have the greatest economy the greatest military
 we've rebuilt our military 2
 5 trillion because when i took it over it was a mess
 and what do they want to do
 let's impeach our president right
 i don't think so
 i don't think so
 i think we're going to have a turnout the likes of which we've never seen in the history of our country
 so we were really forced just to put it away we were forced
 i said just do it
 got the approval from ukraine
 i have to ask
 i said hey do you guys mind
 they said that's a strange request
 i said don't worry about it
 do you mind
 and they said please go ahead
 nothing was said wrong on that call
 so we released the transcript of the call which was so good that that crooked adam schiff this guy is crooked he had to make up a fake conversation that never happened- a fake conversation that never happened and he delivered it to the united states congress and the american people
 it was a total fraud
 and then nancy pelosi said oh i think the president said that
 these people are sick
 i'm telling you they're sick
 and you know what
 had they waited one day longer they would have had the transcript of the actual call word for word
 it would've been perfect
 instead they released it they went early they said all these horrible things
 you know why
 because they never thought in a million years that i was going to release a transcript of the call
 so nancy pelosi upon hearing a false story from a whistleblower that had no clue what was going on in that call or somebody gave her very bad advice but also hearing it from shifty shift nancy pelosi said a day before seeing the transcript of the call with the ukrainian president we've got to impeach him
 we've got to impeach him
 right
 and then she saw the call and she said to her people what the hell
 nobody ever told me this was the call
 but she keeps going anyway because the press is fake and they play right into their hands
 the do nothing democratic extremists have gone so far left that they believe it should not be a crime to cross our border illegally and it should be a crime to have a totally appropriate casual beautiful accurate phone call with a foreign leader
 i don't think so
 as our brilliant white house counsel wrote to the democrats yesterday he said their highly partisan and unconstitutional effort threatens grave and lasting damage to our democratic institutions to our system of free elections and to the american people
 that's what it is
 to the american people
 it's so terrible
 democrats are on a crusade to destroy our democracy
 that's what's happening
 we will never let it happen
 we will defeat them
 i mean look at their debates
 these people are crazy
 they want to spend 99 trillion to redo buildings all over the united states
 i said what about china
 what about russia
 what about india
 what about all these other countries where that stuff is just flowing out
 it's all right
 let him give you the answer
 man did the cops act fast
 he's already gone
 that's unbelievable
 that's the fastest … you know i have … look i love law enforcement
 i love the cops
 i love the police all of it
 minneapolis minneapolis you've got a rotten man
 you've got to change your mayor
 you've got a bad mayor
 you've got a bad mayor
 but you know what
 the police … i've done this a lot and every once in a while we'll have very little disturbance
 it's really … actually is there any place where we can have more fun than at a trump rally
 and we've set every record at every place virtually that we've gone
 and one of the big musicians said and trump does it without a guitar
 can you believe it
 without a guitar
 but this guy … so i've had it a lot where … but sometimes it'll take the police like 30 seconds 50 seconds
 it's like roger penske when you watch him who's getting the presidential medal of freedom by the way pretty soon
 he won 18 indy 500s 18 roger penske
 but it's like the way they change those tires takes four seconds to change the whole damn thing
 i say how the hell do they do it
 that's the way these cops just reacted
 that was a record
 i think it was a … i've had good service but i've never had anything like that
 i look up the guy is already gone
 ah we love you with the red shirts
 so now the democrats are making a pathetic bid to save sleepy joe sleepy joe biden
 and you know what
 i'd love to run against him to be honest
 anybody like that
 if you can't beat him in a debate you've got a big problem folks
 you can't beat him in a debate you can't be president
 because what are you going to do against president xi and kim jong un
 you can't beat sleepy joe but now we're going to meet with kim jong un
 i don't think so
 but he's totally owned and totally controlled by the washington swamp for many years
 two months after president obama put joe in charge of ukraine policy they put joe biden in charge of ukraine policy
 listen to this
 and the press will not write it
 they say in totally unsubstantiated charges … every time they talk about him
 president trump has said that his son walked away with a fortune
 now you know that's a totally unsubstantiated charge
 really
 it's not an unsubstantiated it's fact
 joe's son hunter got thrown out of the navy and then he became a genius on wall street in about two days
 by the way whatever happened to hunter
 where the hell is he
 where's hunter
 hey fellows i have an idea for a new t-shirt
 i love the cops but let's do another t-shirt
 where's hunter
 where is he
 here's hunter being examined by sleepy eyes chuck todd or some of these people
 hunter it's so great that you're here sir
 hunter i know they're giving you approximately 168000 a month
 i hear they paid you a big check of 3 million
 i just want to speak on behalf of nbc who's absolutely one of the worst
 i just want to tell you … hunter hunter i just want to tell you i couldn't be happier for you and your family and i know you don't know anything about energy and i know it's an energy company but i think they made a great deal hunter
 and then they fly to china and i'm dealing with people right now
 they're tough as hell those chinese negotiators and hunter who's not too smart hunter
 he goes in he has a meeting he walks out in his fund with 1
5 billion with a b one point five billion dollars
 these aren't the same chinese negotiators that i'm dealing with i can tell you
 these are not the same ones but we are doing very well in that negotiation
 now think of it where's hunter
 where is hunter
 i want to see hunter
 hunter you know nothing about energy you know nothing about china you know nothing about anything frankly
 hunter you're a loser
 why did you get one point five billion dollars hunter
 and your father was never considered smart
 he was never considered a good senator
 he was only a good vice president because he understood how to kiss barack obama's ass
 true
 thank you
 thank you
 it's true
 it's true
 and they're always saying the same thing
 yeah he got a billion five we admit it they admit it it's nothing but oh it's not that same thing president trump made a totally unsubstantiated claim about hunter biden and his father
 it's not unsubstantiated you crooked son of a guns it's 100 true
 100
 even the smart guys on wall street and i know all of them they are smart
 they've never seen anything like that one before
 i've called them
 does that ever happen
 never happens
 guy walks in no experience no nothing
 walks out with a billion five
 gee
 flies in on air force two with his father the vice president
 don't forget that's when he was vice president
 so china gives his son 1
5 billion
 how would you like to have joe biden take over negotiations right now with china
 i don't think so
 i don't think so
 meanwhile biden allowed china to rip off america for eight years as vice president and barack obama let him just rob us blind and we're not doing that anymore
 those days are over
 the bidens got rich and that is substantiated
 while america got robbed that's what happened
 sleepy joe and his friends out america they didn't have tough negotiations
 i look at these trade deals and i say who the hell could have done this
 if you didn't … if you had no business instinct no business ability if you had nothing if you're dumb as hell you wouldn't make these deals they're so bad
 i say who made these deals
 who made these deals
 but we're ripping them all up and redoing them and they're going to be very good
 wait until you see what happens
 now that i'm your president you see it
 america is winning again and we're respected again as a nation
 a brand new report just came out as i'm walking on the stage
 hard to believe actually
 it turns out that joe biden was vice president he worked with the so called whistle blower
 this is nothing but a partisan witch hunt sabotage and i'm sure they're going to say it's totally unsubstantiated but one of them wrote this story
 congratulations by the way
 that's very nice
 that's really good
 that's the way you should do it
 good
 good
 good
 in the twisted worldview of democrats and the media it's okay for politicians to ship our jobs to foreign countries flood our communities with drugs and crime and enrich themselves at america's expense
 their treachery is allowed because they go along with the rigged washington game and it is far more rigged
 when i ran i thought it was rigged but this is crazy what's happening
 but if you refuse to bow or bend to the washington swamp which i could do very easily i'd be much more popular
 folks it would be so much easier
 but they smear you they spy on you and they target your friends your family your staff for harassment for abuse for destruction
 i came down to washington with incredible people
 we won a great political campaign
 they were bright eyed and bushy tailed
 that's a nice phrase
 they came down they were happy
 they wanted to turn the country around
 they wanted to do great things
 all of a sudden they get summoned and they get subpoenaed by robert mueller
 how good was he as a witness
 not too good and by people that were i call them the 13 angry democrats that turned into 18 angry democrats
 it was disgraceful
 so people that were going down sir what is this
 i look oh wow that's a subpoena
 what the hell is this
 they took people … i really mean this
 they took people that were full of life and energy and vigor
 we had just won the greatest campaign in the history of american politics it's true
 it's true
 and they destroyed their lives
 they destroyed their lives
 they went home
 i could name many people one in particular who came down an incredible young woman
 she was going to help people
 she wanted to help people
 she had causes that were so good
 she wanted to help people and she ended up going home dark dark
 her life became hell
 they ruined people
 they destroyed people good people
 people that ended up paying far more money in legal fees than they made
 than they made
 they destroyed great people
 they're vicious horrible and the media was behind every single step
 they destroyed so many lives
 they destroyed so many lives and they're continuing to do it
 and it's a disgrace
 when all of their ludicrous hoaxes have been exposed as frauds these sinister fakers then tried to impeach you for daring to call out their own corruption
 there's nothing like the dirty political establishment and i have to tell you this is friend of mine very smart brilliant guy was with me about two weeks ago
 we just got rid of the russia hoax and then a week later the ukraine hoax starts
 i had a week of like i can think about everything perfect
 it's so beautiful
 and he said president
 i said call me donald
 you've called me donald for 35 years
 i will
 thank you donald
 i've lost all my friends because they're all scared to talk
 honestly i'm the president that they can't talk to me anymore
 it's like they're afraid
 they respect the office
 it's true
 they say president
 i say do me a favor richard
 you've called me donald for 35 years
 call me donald please
 i want somebody to call me donald
 true
 he said to me i just told him call me … he said president i can't do it
 he said
 so he says president you've been here now for think of it almost three years
 can you believe we're here three years
 we we it's we
 and we have to promise them no more than 16 years
 okay
 no more
 no more
 16 more years
 i'm only kidding
 now they'll go back
 see he wants to run for more
 but he said president could i ask you a question
 it's so important to me
 he's a great businessman very successful
 he said you deal with all of these nations these great powerful … who is the worst to deal with
 is it china
 is it north korea
 is india
 is it russia
 please tell me mr
 pres who is the toughest nation to deal with
 i said you're not going to believe this
 it's the usa is the toughest nation to deal with
 the usa
 it's true
 because we're dealing with some very sick and deranged people
 there is nothing that the dirty political establishment hates more than a president that they cannot intimidate own and control
 they're trying to stop me because they know that i don't answer to them i answer to you
 it's true
 i never say this
 i don't think i've ever said it in a speech but they'll find out if i did
 they'll give me pinocchios he said it before but i don't know if i ever said this before
 but i make as president about 450000
 i give it away
 i don't care
 i don't want it
 i never hear anything
 can you imagine if i didn't
 i give it away to … you can only give it you can't keep it
 you can't actually make a gift
 you can give it to your different agencies
 so i can give it to health i can give it to transportation i can give it to military but i give it away all the time
 now and if i ever did … but it's 450
 if somebody stays from let's say a middle east country in one of my hotels and we charge him 392 dollars and 53 cents for staying and i never heard of the guy and i don't want to hear about him they say trump is getting rich off our nation
 i lose billions being president
 i don't care
 it's nice to be rich i guess
 but i lose billions
 if somebody rents a room someplace and they pay me two months in rent or hotel fees i never heard of the people
 i never know who they are
 they say emoluments
 nobody ever heard of the word emoluments before
 emoluments
 it's the craziest thing i've ever seen
 i tell you it's cost me billions of dollars to be president
 it really has
 and at some point i'll probably to prove that and i look forward to doing it

 it's very easy
 it's very easy
 and there is nothing that makes me happier than making that decision to run and win and straighten out the mess that these people have created
 so in desperate attempt to attack our movement
 nancy and chuck two beauties have given control of the democrat party entirely over to the radical left including minnesota's own representative ilhan omar
 i know you people
 i know you people
 i know the people of minnesota and i want to tell you and i also at the same time it's both a question and a statement how'd the hell did that ever happen
 how did it happen
 how did it happen
 congresswoman omar is an america hating socialist
 she minimized the september 11th attack on our homeland
 where far more than 3000 people died saying some people did something big deal
 some people did something
 she pleaded for compassion for isis recruits right here in minnesota
 omar laughed that americans speak of al-qaeda
 you remember that tape
 speak of al-qaeda
 but when we say something about the united states you just don't say america with any intensity
 remember that
 representative omar has a history of launching virulent anti-semitic screeds whether you like it or not
 she's said the us support for israel is all about the benjamins
 she said that pro-israel lawmakers have an allegiance to a foreign country
 omar wrote that israel has hypnotized the world may allah awaken the people and help them to see the evil doings of israel and the united states
 how do you have such a person representing you in minnesota
 i'm very angry at you people right now
 she is a disgrace to our country and she is one of the big reasons that i'm going to win and the republican party is going to win minnesota in 13 months
 thank you very much
 so we're honored to have with us today a special guest a man that really is a terrific talented writer
 he knows a great deal about all those tangled lies of omar
 mr
 scott johnson of power line
 he wrote some stuff i can't believe it
 where's scott
 where's scott
 thank you scott
 thank you scott
 what a job
 man do you have her figured out
 the only problem is scott it's incredible talent much more talented than most of these people that you heard about
 the problem is they never pick it up
 they don't want to pick it up but we pick it up scott and the people get it and we thank you for your great reporting
 thank you
 thank you very much
 and scott reported everything about omar is a fraud including her name
 scott reports his sources told him that quote omar's legal husband was omar's brother and that she had married him for fraudulent purposes
 you mean like coming into the united states maybe
 and as scott says we have seen a plethora of congressional scandals in our history yet we have never seen scandals like omar's in congress and nothing gets done about it
 i hope that some of you people are looking because what aoc has gotten away with campaign financing and what … i call it aoc plus three that's what it is
 and omar is one of the three
 what aoc has gotten away with all of that money that she used for her personal self with campaign finance is worse and nothing happens to them but it happens to you and it's not fair
 the fact is we're in a struggle for the survival of democracy in america
 the only message these radical socialists and extremists will understand- message these radical socialists and extremists will understand is a crushing defeat on november 3rd 2020
 with your help we will win back the house we will keep the senate and we will win the white house
 and we're thrilled to be joined tonight by some incredible people that have helped me so much
 one of your tremendous talented tough congressman tom emmer
 tom
 also a man you don't want to fight him and you don't want to play him in hockey because he was tough
 he just won not that recently but pretty recently and i was out here campaigning for him and working hard and it turned out to be an easy race because everyone loves him and respects him
 congressman pete stauber
 and a man who gets in the trenches and he just doesn't care
 he wants to win for the people
 he loves you
 he loves this state
 he loves this country
 jim hagedorn
 thank you
 and a great friend of mine with his incredible family
 he's a friend
 he's smart
 i guess you'd say he's brilliant
 his education is incredible his military career has been incredible
 then he ran for office and now he's a united states senator from the great state of arkansas senator tom cotton
 great guy
 and minnesota senate majority leader paul gazelka
 paul
 thank you paul
 minnesota gop chairwoman jennifer carnahan
 she's been incredible
 i said jennifer are we going to win in 13 months
 she said honestly sir i've never seen anything like this
 it's going to be easy
 don't ever say… just assume we're two points behind okay
 two points behind
 you never ever… please
 always just assume you're a little behind but we're going to win this state by so much that people are going to be shocked
 ad plenty of other states too
 we had a rally three weeks ago in new mexico and new mexico's a hard state for republicans hasn't been won in a long time also
 and we had receptivity that was unbelievable
 the audience was 40 hispanic where we're doing great
 and you know hispanic they understand borders better than anybody better than we do
 they understand safety they understand their job they don't want people taking it away they don't want crime
 they understand it better
 that's why we're doing so well but we're in new mexico and i'm telling you that was electric
 but honestly all evenings are electric
 we haven't had any bad ones
 we haven't
 they're all electric
 a woman who headed up the great state of michigan for me a state that hadn't been won in a long time by a republican for whatever reason but it hadn't been won
 i guess we didn't have the right candidates right
 but a woman who would call me constantly
 i'd say i don't want to talk to her
 she's giving me a headache
 sir if you make one more trip you're going to win michigan
 i say all right i make the trip i go back home
 i get a call the next morning sir we need one more
 this went over and over and over and we ended up winning the state of michigan and i said who the hell was that woman that kept bugging me to go back to michigan and speak just one more time every week
 one more time sir
 and her name is ronna mcdaniel
 she's fantastic and she's the head of the rnc
 she's great
 and our campaign manager a man who's really been… they used to say that crooked hillary had a very very sophisticated campaign
 after she lost they said i guess it wasn't sophisticated
 we had a sophisticated campaign
 nobody knows the world of computers better than this guy
 brad parscale
 remember when they used to say it
 you know i never got credit
 my father used to teach me if you can do it for less and win that's good
 he wasn't talking politics
 the last thing… he's looking down
 he's definitely looking down not looking up
 he was great
 he was tough but he was great
 but my father would say if you could do it for less and win that's a good thing not a bad thing
 if you can build a building for less money than the guy across the street and if it's a nicer building and you can rent for less you're really… that's like a good thing
 so in the campaign we spent much less money than crooked hillary clinton much
 and we won
 and we won
 we won 306 to 223
 that's a pretty big… remember
 remember they said electoral college
 by the way when you run if you're running the electoral college is like the 100 yard dash and the total vote you don't go certain places
 you focus
 electoral college
 we have to explain to them it's different
 so we won 306 and do you remember they sued to say one's the 100 yard dash
 you practice
 one's the mile
 you practice
 it's a different race
 winning the total vote is much easier in my opinion
 the electoral college i had to go to 22 different states
 for the total vote i'd go to four states maximum right
 much easier
 it's much easier
 i'm all for it but the electoral college is better for our country because it forces you to go places that you wouldn't go
 i love maine
 i went to maine four or five times
 i needed one point
 maine gave me one point
 and what happened
 what happened
 i went there numerous times
 everyone said why
 because i was told by these fraudsters back here in the media that trump cannot get to 270
 he cannot get… they had me maximum if everything worked right
 at 269
 so i kept going to maine and you know what
 we won that one point in maine
 we won it
 it's true
 but i kept going
 they say why
 i said well first of all it is really a beautiful place but we won the point
 but they said he can not get to 270 and i heard this for months and months
 i had such a headache almost as bad as listening to mike's damn commercials about those pillows
 maybe i need one of those pillows to cure my headache
 does it cure headaches
 i think so
 but here's the thing
 here's the thing
 so they said he cannot get to 270
 in other words you can't win
 you don't get to 270 it's over
 you can't win right
 he cannot do it
 there's no way of doing it and they were right
 i got to 306
 they were right
 but i didn't get to 306
 you got to 306
 we won incredible states
 we won incredible states
 we won wisconsin we won michigan we won pennsylvania we won north carolina we won south carolina we won florida
 what a run
 do you remember the evening that we won
 i think… look forgetting me i think it was won of all of us together because we all worked hard
 i was the messenger but we all worked hard
 that was our victory not my victory
 but that was one of the greatest nights in the history of television one of the greatest nights and hopefully it'll go down when we're allowed to get all of this stuff seeded… you know it's like a tree
 you plant it
 you plant it
 it has to go but it needs a little… that's why we need the four more additionally years
 it's got to grab on and catch so they can't destroy it
 so they can't destroy it
 but i think it'll go down and i hope it's going to go down as one of the greatest evenings in the history of this country because it's never happened anything like that before
 and these guys don't even question it
 they just sit back and say i guess he's right about that
 i'll never forget the night before i was at a tremendous arena
 the place was going crazy
 it was like this going crazy and two reporters that hate my guts they looked at themselves they looked at each other
 famous shot
 they're looking like this and they're saying what the hell is going on
 they knew
 they knew
 and i didn't need beyonce and jay z and i didn't need little bruce springsteen and all of these people
 they'd get all these people
 they'd come in because she couldn't get a crowd
 they'd come in they'd sing
 they got bruce springsteen
 okay
 he'd do about two songs and leave
 what happens is they leave and then everyone leaves with them and she's still speaking in front of the same lousy crowd
 it's the craziest thing i've ever seen
 and then they complain
 sometimes i'll use terrible word like hell
 the other day i used the word hell
 i got hell from… they said he used terrible language
 i used the word hell
 it was so bad
 but you've got to hear jay z the words he was using he was using the f word all over the place and then the next day they say i use bad language
 the word hell is a terrible word
 these people are sick
 but that was an amazing evening
 i'll never forget that evening
 look
 outside of your family and your children and things… i love you too darling
 it was one of the highest rated evenings in the history of television
 you add up all those networks
 remember the woman crying
 oh my god
 no they weren't biased at all
 now another very special man who's with us today but he'll never be a man to me he'll always be my boy you know what i mean
 right
 he's my boy
 he's my little six foot six boy eric trump
 and the parents understand that right
 they may be big and strong and older
 to a parent a child is always their boy or always their little beautiful girl and i know that's probably politically incorrect
 they'll say it was terrible what he said about women
 terrible
 but they're our boy and they're our girl and it doesn't matter how old we get and how old they get is that a correct statement
 and i'm also proud to endorse your next republican senator from minnesota a man that i've known a man that is tough and smart a man that's running against somebody that's never done a damn thing in the senate mr
 jason lewis
 and jason did a great job in congress
 congressman lewis thank you very much and thank you for putting up with all of this stuff because i'll tell you it's going to be nasty
 it's going to be nasty
 they're going to make up stories about you
 they're going to say things that's going to want to make your wife say why did i marry this guy
 just say don't worry about it
 it's just another phony story
 thank you very much mr
 and mrs
 lewis
 jason thank you
 and jason they can say that about tom cotton
 he's too perfect this guy
 he can't say… they can't say it about you tom
 anyway good luck jason
 do well
 and i don't know why but with all of the great people i just introduced for tonight maybe this is the most important person because i turned on a very good show in the morning
 fox and friends
 they treat us great
 i just want fairness
 what a great group
 ainsley and steve and by the way brian has gotten a lot better right
 and how good does jessie waters do
 how good
 right
 just some really great people
 and again tucker's been very good i have to say
 he's been good
 smart
 he's been great
 tucker and the legendary sean hannity
 great
 number one
 number one show
 sean's got the number one show
 and laura ingraham is knocking them out of the park laura
 and you go over maria bartiromo and the great lou dobbs
 how good are they
 lou dobbs
 and many more
 and many more
 how about greg
 greg used to hate me
 now he's good
 oh we can't forget… we can't forget judge jeanine
 i would be in such trouble if i forgot judge jeanine
 no these are… and there are many more
 i just… look i'm just rattling some names off but they're just terrific people
 they're terrific people
 but a man that i have to really say something very special about… 00 slot because i'm out of there pretty good and i see a handsome young man named bob kroll cops for trump
 and he's talking about this lousy mayor they've got
 now he didn't quite say that but i say it
 he's talking about this lousy mayor that won't let the cops the police the law enforcement… my father always used to say son… and he meant it to
 never say cops
 it's disrespectful
 say police officer
 i said okay pop
 but honestly the truth is with time i love you guys whether you're cops police officers law enforcement
 i'll call you whatever you want
 it doesn't matter
 you are so great so respected
 you don't even know how much our public loves you
 you don't know it
 you don't know it
 you don't know it
 but i see this guy and i don't know if he's done a lot of television before but he was very effective and very good
 and he was saying how the police aren't being allowed to take care of this rally and yet with president obama and bush and all these people they were fine fine
 everybody comes
 they fall asleep at a rally
 but they weren't allowed to do the job for us and they went wild
 so what i want to do… go home to mommy
 mommy says i saw you on television tonight
 i love trump
 don't you ever do that again
 yes mom
 yes mom
 but the job he did before the election i came right here to minnesota and i pledged to address this really important issue and it's the issue of law enforcement
 and when i saw this man this great gentleman on television pouring out his guts pouring out his heart… i don't know him
 he knows i've been good to law enforcement
 he knows i've been good to as my father would say the police
 he knows i love the cops
 he knows that and so does everyone else
 i mean it's so many shirts so many red shirts and there are plenty of people here without the red shirts and i want to just tell you the respect that we have for law enforcement is unbound
 it's unbound
 come up here
 bob come up
 say something
 thank you fellas
 i'll see you later
 thank you
 thank you very much
 thank you
 great people
 thank you
 what a group
 i think your very weak mayor made a mistake when he took them on
 as you know for many years leaders in washington brought large numbers of refugees to your state from somalia without considering the impact on schools and communities and taxpayers
 i promised you that as president i would give local communities a greater say in refugee policy and put in place enhanced vetting and responsible immigration controls
 and i've done that
 since coming into office i have reduced refugee resettlement by 85 and as you know maybe especially in minnesota i kept another promise
 i issued an executive action making clear that no refugees will be resettled in any city or any state without the express written consent of that city or that state
 so speak to your mayor
 you should be able to decide what is best for your own cities and for your own neighborhoods and that's what you have the right to do right now
 and believe me no other president would be doing that
 if democrats were ever to seize power they would open the floodgates to unvetted uncontrolled migration at levels you have never seen before
 do you think you have it bad now
 you would never have seen anything like what they want to do
 but in the trump administration we will always protect american families first and that has not been done in minnesota
 we've also implemented the strongest screening and vetting mechanisms ever put into place
 we are keeping terrorists criminals and extremists the hell out of our country
 and i want to thank the country of mexico
 the president of mexico has been incredible
 we have now 27000 mexican soldiers
 they're great and they're tough and they are now protecting our border and those numbers have gone down like this
 thank you mr
 president
 we will not make the mistakes made in european countries that allow a violent ideology to take root in our country on our shores
 we're not going to allow it to happen
 and as you all know to protect our citizens from those who would do harm to us i instituted a very controversial very hard to get travel ban on some of the world's most dangerous countries
 and the other day one of the fake news reporters in the back said… they were talking about the travel ban and they said well you know the president has lost in court
 they said where
 on the travel ban
 and he's right
 i lost and then i lost at the appellate division and then i won at the united states supreme court
 right
 and he knew that but he said i lost on the… and he was right
 i lost and then i lost again but then i won and we have the travel ban
 but instead of saying he lost and then he lost at the appellate and then he won at the united states supreme court he said he lost on the travel ban
 these are very dishonest people
 do you understand that
 very dishonest people
 in the republican party we believe that those who seek to join our society must embrace our values honor our history and love our people
 democrats also support deadly sanctuary cities which release dangerous criminal aliens into the heart of your communities and we're not letting it happen anymore
 republicans believe american cities should be sanctuaries for americans not for criminal aliens
 my administration is taking historic action to secure the border
 we have reduced illegal border crossings by over 60 since may and we are building the wall faster than anyone ever anticipated it could be built
 and this is a serious wall
 you've all seen it
 it's going up rapidly and you think that was easy
 i had every democrat in congress fighting me fighting me fighting me
 i had a lot of the rhinos fighting me
 they say see he's not getting it built
 he's not getting… let me tell you
 you have every democrat fighting you
 we took it from here and we took it from there and we took it from all over the place and we got that thing
 that's the biggest patchwork of financing you've ever seen and that sucker is going up and it is the finest it is the strongest it's largely 30 feet tall which is the maximum height that they wanted
 i went to the border patrol and i sat down with 15 representatives of the border patrol and i said what do you want
 what's your ideal
 i actually said i want to give you the rolls royce and they killed me for that
 they said it's not an american made product
 yeah they happened to be right
 no they're right about that one
 they're actually right there tom
 but i said i want to give you the rolls royce of walls
 tell me
 and they told me everything and then we built some alternative walls
 we built all different types
 we built about seven of them and then we had climbers come in
 the one that worked the best was the one we're building
 it also unfortunately… the bad news it's also the most expensive
 but we got it for the right price
 we got it for the right price
 it's steel it's hardened concrete it's deep it's high it's a thing of beauty
 and it's going to keep bad people out of our country
 that's what it's going to do
 and the democrats knew this
 most of the democrats four years ago they wanted a wall
 now all of a sudden they don't want a wall
 you know why they don't want a wall
 because i want it
 that's the only reason
 and i just thought of it a year ago
 i said man this could've been so much easier
 all i had to do is say we don't want a wall and they would've given me all the financing i wanted for the wall
 what was i thinking
 we're not going to build a wall and they would have forced me to build it
 i would've… it's true
 under this administration we are also ending the- … this administration
 we are also ending the endless wars
 we have to do it folks
 we have to do it
 we have totally defeated the isis caliphate and i did that in rather quick time if you remember because we have the greatest fighting machine now
 when i came in and was totally depleted
 we have great generals we have great warfighters and they did it so fast
 i flew to iraq i met with the generals right
 i met with the generals
 i said i hear it's going to take a year to two years
 sir we can do it in two weeks
 i said what
 they don't let us fight sir
 they don't let us fight
 we want to fight
 they don't let us fight
 i said i let you fight
 i said how come if they say it's going to take anywhere from a year to two years you say you can do it so quickly
 he said sir we're going to hit them from the front
 we're going to hit them from the back
 we're going to hit them from the sides from underground from overground
 we going to hit the hell out of them
 and they did
 and we won very quickly
 but from now on we want to fight where it is to the benefit of the united states of america not to the benefit of other countries
 and we will only fight to win
 we're only going to fight to win
 we don't fight to win
 we don't fight to win
 the turks have been fighting with the kurds for two centuries and turkey as you know is a nato ally
 but i've been rough on them
 we've defeated 100 of that isis caliphate and no longer have any troops in the area
 we don't have any troops
 the troops have been pulled out
 where turkey is carrying out now a very tough campaign against the kurds get them out
 so turkey is right now waging a very tough campaign against the kurds
 we got along with the kurds and we helped the kurds
 and don't forget they're also fighting for their land
 you know that
 but they're fighting
 so we have three choices
 you're ready
 here are the three choices
 we don't have any soldiers there because we've left
 we won
 we left
 take a victory united states
 we left
 take a victory take a victory
 bring our troops back home
 i told this story yesterday i have to sign letters it's the hardest thing i have to do
 i sign letters dear mr
 and mrs
 smith from arkansas
 dear mr
 and mrs
 jones from alabama
 dear mr
 and mrs
 somebody from some great state i'm sorry to inform you your son has been killed in combat
 i'm so sorry
 and every letter is individually done because sometimes the parents they're grieving and they get together with other parents and i don't want to see that it's like the same letter
 so we do different letters
 it's the hardest thing i have to do
 hardest thing
it's the hardest thing i have … i was telling tom cotton it's the hardest thing that i have to do
 and i sign those letters and it just it breaks your heart
 and by the way there's a time to fight
 nobody fights harder than i do
 but there's a time and there's not necessarily a time
 but i send these letters out quite a few
 and sometimes i send letters out it's called blue on green where we're teaching people how to fight and then they turn the gun on our soldiers and shoot them in the back
 and that's the hardest thing for a parent
 i have all of them
 i know everyone
 that's the hardest thing for a parent when they get notification because they learn how their child has died
 when the so-called people that were teaching how to fight turn the gun on them and shoot
 we've had a lot of that a lot of it in afghanistan more than we've ever had proportionately before
 it's a horrible horrible thing
 but i have to sign these letters
 and sometimes i go out to a place dover air force base it's a very tough experience
 mike pence goes i go other people go tom cotton goes
 we go out there and we meet the parents and the families the wives the children the sisters the brothers
 we meet them and we talked to them and their son or daughter is being flown in from some far away place in a coffin and these things are just impossible
 i don't know how parents can do it even
 and i'll meet them
 and we have a particular colonel that's all he does
 so good
 so professional
 that's what he does
 he said i greet the dead sir
 i greet the dead
 and what happens is this big incredible machine flies in this tremendous cargo plane and it flies in so powerful so big
 i'll be talking to some of the parents and they'll act like they're fine
 i said how are you doing
 we're fine sir
 we're fine
 we're really good
 i say that's great
 and i'll tell the colonel i'll say colonel i think they're doing great
 no sir they're not going to do great
 you'll see
 and i didn't know what he was talking about this is the first time
 then we went outside to the runway and this incredible machine is flying in and it lands and it comes over and it pulls up and we have military guards we have incredible talented musicians that do this
 that's what they do
 what happens is that door opens up and the colonel told me he said sir when that door opens up those same people that you think are okay do things that you'll never see
 you will hear sounds like you've never heard
 that's what he does
 i saw that door open up with a coffin with a flag over it
 the door was opened and these beautiful soldiers five or six on each side lifting the coffin and walking down the runway the plank they call it off this cargo plane
 and i see parents make sounds that were just 20 minutes ago absolutely fine make sounds scream and cry like you've never seen before
 the colonel was telling me that sir you'll see things that you've never seen before
 a mother who was fine 20 minutes ago you think breaking the military line and jumping off and then jumping onto a coffin of her son or her daughter jumping on on top of the flowers on top of the american flag
 i've seen this
 then i have all these people that want to stay
 they want to stay
 and i don't want to stay
 we were supposed to be in syria for 30 days
 we've now been there for 10 years
 we were supposed to be in afghanistan for a short period of time
 we're now going to be there for close to 19 years
 it's time to bring them home
 it's time to bring them home
 it's true
 time to bring them home
 we've done our job we've defeated everyone that we're supposed to defeat
 and now we are we are policing we are now policing
 that's what we're doing
 we're policing
 and that as i said no more respect for the police but these are military people and those are police but we are now policing
 we're not fighting we're policing
 and you know what
 after all of these years … one other story and i have to tell you
 i go to walter reed on friday and i do it quite often
 i gave out five purple hearts
 and i meet people that are so beautiful so amazing
 i met five warriors and one was so badly hurt with the loss of arms and a leg another one … they're just very very devastated
 but these are great great people
 and i gave out the purple heart
 and i see the parents and i have to say walter reed i want to just say the doctors there the job they do you know you hear so many complaints about doctors and about the vets and the vets' care and nobody's done better
 we got choice for the vets
 we did things for the vets that nobody thought would be possible
 but i saw these young men and i gave them their purple hearts
 and their parents were there crying
 and one of them was so amazing
 i said what's your problem
 sir my face was blown apart
 my nose was absolutely just blown apart
 he said sir it's incredible
 and i looked at him i said that's the most beautiful nose i've ever seen
 what do you mean
 he said a doctor worked on my face for 10 hours in the field
 he said there were a thousand fragments
 now i don't know if that's right but well a lot
 he meant a lot
 he said there were a thousand fragments
 he rebuilt my nose with glue
 he glued the bones together
 he rebuilt my nose
 i say you have the most beautiful nose i've ever seen and it's true
 and his father came over to me he said sir father was crying he said sir honestly my son looks better now
 he said my son did not have a good look
 he knows
 now look at it it's beautiful it's beautiful
 but these doctors at walter reed and these army and marine and the medical doctors they are unbelievably great people
 and they see sights that you and i hopefully will never see
 they see things that nobody will ever see and there's nobody like them
 and i have to give a shout out to those people there's nobody like them
 so in the case of turkey and syria and the kurds we could send in a thousand troops for a military conflict with turkey
 no you don't want to do that
 we could hit turkey very hard financially
 or we could mediate a deal between turkey and the kurds
 i like that
 you know
 let's mediate a deal
 but remember they've been fighting each other for hundreds of years and we were artificially put there in this case by president obama
 so we did our job
 we knocked out
 and i'll tell you another thing we have to be treated fairly
 we have to be treated fairly
 we're not treated fairly by other nations
 we captured many many isis fighters
 most of them came from europe
 they came from germany
 they came from france
 they came from all of these countries
 and we called them i called them myself in many cases i said take your fighters
 they said we don't want them
 you take them
 i said no no no we did you a big favor
 they're citizens of germany
 they're citizens of france
 they're citizens of these various countries in europe
 take your fighters
 we don't want them sir
 we don't want them
' and i said how unfair are we treated
 we do them a great favor and they won't take the fighters
 so we're doing some things that are pretty amazing
 every once in a while you have to change course and do what you have to do
 the united states has spent 8 trillion in the middle east
 we've lost thousands of brave soldiers and tens of thousands of terribly wounded people great people their lives will never be the same
 these wars produced only chaos and bloodshed
 and all of the blood and treasure we sacrificed made the middle east really it's less safe it's less stable and it's less secure
 and i say it all the time
 the single greatest mistake our country made in its history was going in to the quicksand of the middle east
 we spent 8 trillion and lost thousands of lives
 and by the way the other side we can talk about that lost millions of lives
 what did we do
 so we're going to pull them out and we're pulling people out and we're trying to make good deals and we're going to bring our soldiers back home and we may need them for something else and they'll be ready
 previous administrations lust for regime change and also put historic christian communities in vastly more danger than they were before we started
 they are some of the biggest victims of these power vacuums and reckless foreign adventures
 the christians the christians
 and we work hard with the christians
 we have tremendous evangelical support
 we work hard with the christians
 so we're slowly getting out of the middle east
 we're doing it carefully
 and we're rebuilding our military like we have never rebuilt our military before
 when i came into office a very prominent general told me because it looked like we could have a big conflict with someone said sir we have no ammunition
 we had old planes
 we had planes that were so old they didn't fly
 we had people going to the desert the plane graveyards airplane graveyards picking up parts
 i never want to hear a president of the united states hear those words again
 i never want to have a president hear the words sir we have no ammunition
 think of that
 think of that
 now thanks to more than two and a half trillion dollar worth of investment in our military we have more ammunition more missiles more rockets more tanks more fighter jets and more of everything else than we've ever had before
 and we have no choice
 you look around the world and we have no choice unfortunately
 and the democrats want to dismantle our military
 after years of building up other countries we are finally building up our country
 that's what we have to do
 we're replacing the disaster known as nafta with the brand new u
s
-mexico-canada agreement usmca a giant victory for our farmers ranchers workers in minnesota
 congress should pass usmca immediately
 we hope that nancy pelosi can start thinking about passing some legislation instead of thinking about nonsense
 and to protect our industrial backbone i placed tariffs on foreign aluminum and foreign steel
 i'm also fighting back against years of chronic trade abuse from china
 and the supply chain of china which was unbreakable is now breaking wide open
 and they understand that
 and i don't blame china for what's taken place over the last 25 years
 i blame the people that led our country that let that happen where hundreds of billions of dollars a year was taken from our country to build china
 it's not china's fault
 in the previous administration they put our nation's natural resources under lock and key including thousands and thousands of acres in a place called superior national forest
 last year i traveled to duluth and announced that we would be ending this injustice reopening superior national forest and restoring mineral exploration for the iron ore mines of minnesota
 tremendous jobs
 and now the iron range is back in business
 the last time i was here a man came up to me he said sir president obama took our heart away took our life away
' i'll never forget it
 a man strong guy had tears in his eyes
 he said you gave us back our life because they took it away from him
 we gave it back
 best iron ore there is anywhere
 my administration is also fighting the democrat socialist healthcare agenda that would obliterate medicare
 republicans will protect medicare and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions
 and for those of you that have private healthcare health insurance 180 million people they are going to end it obliterate it and most people are thrilled with it
 we are going to leave it
 you're going to have your plan the way you want it
 and there's no plan like those plans
 virtually every top democrat also now supports late term abortion ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up to the moment of birth
 that is why i've asked congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from god
 democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion socialism and blatant washington corruption
 the republican party is the party of the american worker the american family and it's the party of the american dream
 for years you watched as your politicians apologized for america
 you remember that
 gee i'm sorry i'm so sorry
 now you have a president who's standing up for america we are standing up for minneapolis and we are standing up for the great state of minnesota
 we begin this political campaign with the best record the best results the best agenda and the only positive vision for america
 we begin this campaign with right now almost three years of perhaps the most successful administration in the history of our country
 together we will help millions more citizens from welfare to work from dependence to independence and from poverty to prosperity
 with your help we will reelect and we will elect a republican congress to create a safe modern fair and lawful system of immigration
 we will enact trade deals that ensure more products are proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase made in the usa
 we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the aids epidemic in america within 10 years
 nobody thought that could be done
 going to be done
 we will defend privacy free speech free assembly religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms
 and above all we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one america
 we support protect and defend the constitution of the united states
 we stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement
 we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life
 we believe that children should be taught to love our country honor our history and always respect our great american flag
 and we live by the words of our great national motto in god we trust
 we stand on the shoulders of american patriots who built this country into the greatest nation ever to exist in history
 our ancestors crossed the oceans settled a continent tamed the wilderness revolutionized industry pioneered science won two world wars defeated fascism and communism and put a man on the face of the moon
 proud citizens like the people of minnesota helped build this country and together we are taking back our country
 we are returning power to you the american people
 with your help your devotion your drive we are going to keep on working we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning winning winning winning
 we are one movement one people one family and one glorious nation under god
 america is thriving like never before
 and ladies and gentlemen of minnesota i will tell you this with great certainty the best is yet to come
 thank you very much
 and just in concluding together we will make america wealthy again we will make america strong again we will make america safe again and we will make america great again
 thank you minnesota
 thank you
