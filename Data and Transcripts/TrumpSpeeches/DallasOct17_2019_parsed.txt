thank you
 thank you very much
 hello dallas
 it's great to be with you tonight
 thank you
 i am thrilled to be here deep in the heart of texas where we just opened a beautiful new louie vuitton plant
 i'm with the freedom loving patriots of the lone star state
 i love it
 there has never been a better time to be a proud texan and there's never a better time to be a proud american
 there never has
 never has
 i came from a small town alvarado texas where we celebrated the incredible revival of american manufacturing and we opened up some beautiful places
 i'll tell you this place is doing great and created in a very short period of time an extra 1000 jobs for texas
 since my election we've created 775000 new jobs across your state including 70000 texas manufacturing jobs
 they said those jobs had disappeared didn't they
 huh
 hey man our country is once again living by two simple rules buy american and hire american
 the economy is booming
 our people are prospering
 our country is thriving and our nation is stronger than ever before
 but the more america achieves the more hateful and enraged these crazy democrats become
 crazy
 they're crazy
 they're crazy
 at stake in this fight is their survival of american democracy itself
 don't kid yourself
 that's what they want
 they are destroying this country but we will never let it happen
 not even close
 for three straight years radical democrats have been drawing to overthrow the results of a great great election
 maybe maybe the greatest election in the history of our country
 they want to oppose an extreme agenda
 they cannot pass it and they cannot win it at the ballot box
 they're not going to win
 the not even going to get … they won't come close in 2020
 they know it
 they know it
 they're not going to win it
 they say let's see
 what's another idea
 what's another idea
 how do we win this election
 you know i really don't believe anymore that they love our country
 i don't believe it
 crazy nancy
 think of that
 that crazy nancy
 she is crazy
 and shifty schiff
 how about this guy
 he makes up my conversation which was perfect
 he makes up my conversation
 he sees what i said
 it doesn't play well because it was perfect
 so he made up a totally false conversation with the ukrainian president and we caught him cold
 everybody knew it anyway
 see we did one thing
 you always have to do the unexpected
 they never thought i'd released the conversation with the ukrainian president
 i want to get him before congress and i want to see what he has to say
 you know they say he has immunity
 why would you have immunity for outright fraud
 why do you have immunity
 why
 he's a fraud
 we're fighting a campaign against leftist socialist and globalists who want to return to reckless wars open borders rampant crime and totally disastrous one way trade deals
 we're changing that one around very quickly
 they believe america is the world's piggy bank and that your tax dollars should subsidize the economy military and defense of every other nation in the world but our own
 it's not happening anymore
 our political opposition made its fortune selling out our nation and its citizens
 and you know that's what's been happening
 and that's why 2016 was so important
 and that's why 2020 i can never say it's more important but you know it's like the roots of a tree
 you plant the baby tree it's got to catch get that extra time
 we'll have more tax cuts
 we'll have even … i'll tell you what we have rebuilt our military
 what we've done has never been done before
 the do nothing democrats have betrayed our country and that great betrayal is over
 we are finally again and we've been doing it now for almost three years
 can you believe we've been doing this for three years
 can you believe it
 i've been a politician for three years
 i can't believe that
 i never thought i'd be called a politician
 i don't like it
 but it is what it is
 but we're finally again putting america first
 the radical democrats want to destroy america as we know it
 they want to indoctrinate our children and teach them that america is a sinful wicked nation
 you see that happening all the time
 and i know it from personal experience
 what they want to teach your kids not good
 they come home mommy daddy this is what i learned
 and you're going oh no don't tell me
 let's get them into another school fast
 they want to disarm law abiding citizens
 they want to take your guns away
 they want to install far left judges to shred our constitution
 it's not happening
 they want to tear down symbols of faith and drive christians and religious believers from the public square
 they want to silence your voices on social media and they want the government to censor muzzle and shut down conservative voices
 you know that
 if they didn't hate our country they wouldn't be doing this to our country
 they wouldn't be doing it because they know better
 they know better
 as an example we're building a great wall along the southern border and it's going up rapidly
 going up
 and you know five years ago almost every one of them wanted a wall until i came along and i said we're going to build a great wall because they could never get it done
 then they stopped the funding
 they made it almost impossible
 few people would've been able to do what we did but we got it from here and we got it from there and we got it from all over the place and we're building that sucker right now and it's having a tremendous effect already
 not easy
 highest level
 everything we said it would be it's moving rapidly
 although the fake news back there they don't want to talk about it
 they don't want to talk about it
 look at all those cameras
 you believe it
 look at all those red lights
 don't worry
 i won't say anything bad about your network because a lot of times i get ready to do a number of these phony networks and you know you see those red lights go off off off off
 they don't want their viewers to see it but that's okay
 i'm not going to say it tonight
 i'm going to say you're legitimate media
 i don't actually mean that
 but you look at that
 but look at all those cameras
 you know that's like the academy awards used to be before it failed
 you know why it failed
 you know why it failed
 because they came after us
 that's why it failed
 it failed because they had stupid people saying horrible things about us
 stupid
 stupid people
 they are stupid people and their ratings have dropped like a rocket
 i love seeing it
 i'm telling you
 love it
 but no matter how hard they try they will fail because the people of texas and the people of america will never surrender our freedom to those people right there
 we will stand strong for family faith god and for country
 last week a very dumb democrat candidate for president that's the end of him in this state pledged to revoke the tax exempt status of many churches and religious charities
 by the way that was after a few weeks ago
 he said excuse me we're going to take your guns away
 that doesn't work well with me
 i called him right
 remember the flailing arms
 nobody noticed it
 i noticed it
 the flailer
 you remember he was flailing all over the place
 i said why is this guy hot
 john cornyn's going to win so easily
 just like ted cruz won
 he's going to win no matter what happens
 but john cornyn is not talking about beto anymore because beto in a few short weeks got rid of guns and got rid of religion
 those are not two good things in texas to get rid of
 i will never allow the federal government to be used to punish americans for their religious beliefs
 i will never allow the irs to be used as a political weapon except in the case of myself where they use it against me
 the radical left tolerates no dissent
 it permits no opposition
 it accepts no compromise
 these people are crazy
 and it has absolutely no respect for the will of the american people
 first it was the russia hoax
 then it was the smearing which continues that disgraceful disgusting smearing of a fine man justice kavanaugh
 and now they continue the outrageous impeachment witch hunt with nothing
 with nothing
 they come after me but what they're really doing is they're coming after the republican party and what they're really really doing is they're coming after and fighting you
 and we never lose
 i'm fighting for everyone who believes in the values traditions and principles that have made our nation the greatest in the history of the world
 and i have to say this we are far greater now than ever before
 you go back four years you go back seven six eight even you go back into another administration you go back 10 and 12 years where were you compared to where you are right now
 we must hold the democrats accountable for their lies and their corruption
 they are corrupt people
 and we must show and vote and we have to go out and we have to win this election coming up
 it's going to be a landslide and we have to make it a landslide
 today's do nothing democrats they don't do anything
 where's the usmca
 everybody wants it
 the democrats even want it and crazy nancy won't let anybody vote on it
 she's nuts
 today's democrats believe anyone who opposes them must be crushed
 it's not just like let's win
 you know i have to say this
 the republicans said i'm not sure i like this because my life hasn't been this way but the republicans play a much softer game
 they really do
 when all of our stars and we have great stars when they went to our speaker of the house at the time and they asked for subpoenas oh let's take it easy
 let's … okay
 i mean i get that too
 she hands them out like it's cookies
 here
 subpoena
 i heard a commentator who happens to be standing right there the other day
 doesn't like us at all
 but said i've never seen anyone hand out so many subpoenas
 i have people getting subpoenas i never heard of
 i said who are those people
 never saw anything like it
 it's a disgrace what they're doing to our country
 we became because of what they do not the republicans and not what we've done because what they've done and what they see
 when people come to my office which is now the oval office which is your office too
 presidents prime ministers kings queens
 i hate to say it
 sometimes dictators they just don't like to go by that title
 they say sir congratulations sir on what you've done
 congratulations on what you've done
 it's incredible
 your economy is the greatest on earth
 and let me tell you it if my crooked opponent would have won the election right now china would be by far the number one nation from an economic standpoint in the world
 we've gone up trillions of dollars
 they've gone down trillions of dollars and we are so far number one so far that they'll never catch us if we are smart right here
 but the do nothing democrats believe anyone who opposes them has to be crushed
 they don't want to just beat them
 they don't want to just beat him
 these are sick people
 they want to crush these people
 the anger the hatred and that any lie or crime or corruption is justified so schiff gets up and makes up my statement
 he makes it up 100 and then he said he didn't speak to the whistle blower
 no we didn't see the whistleblower
 and what about the whistleblower
 the whistleblower got it all wrong
 who's the whistleblower
 who's the whistleblower
 who is the whistleblower
 we have to know
 is the whistleblower a spy
 and who is the ig that did this
 all he had to do is look at the tape or look at what they wrote down the transcribed version of the phone call
 compare that to the whistle blower's account and you see it had nothing to do with it
 so why does the ig allow a thing like this to happen to our country
 why
 why
 got a lot of bad people out there but one by one we're advancing
 one by one
 just look at the terrible foreign corruption of the bidens
 i hate to talk about him
 you know why
 i don't think the guy's got a chance
 sleepy joe
 i don't think he's got it
 i don't see it
 i don't know
 i've got these great brilliant senators over here
 i have all these congressmen over here
 fellows i don't think he has a chance
 i'd like him to
 i'd like him to
 you know i thought pocahontas was gone left in embers
 you got to give her credit
 those embers they kept going going going
 now it looks like she's doing better
 but i don't think joe has a chance
 but did you see the other night where cnn in a totally unsubstantiated statement the president said this about you
 we're so sorry he said that
 his son walked out with a billion and a half dollars from china
 these were not the same chinese people i just dealt with
 i will tell you that
 but joe biden was in charge of ukraine policy while his son with absolutely no energy experience just got thrown out of the navy like a dog was paid massive sums of money by a ukrainian energy company
 you know that's called
 it's called a payoff folks
 he didn't no energy at all knew nothing about energy
 they hired him paying him massive amounts of money much more than the 50000 a month you heard about
 that's a lot
 that's a lot
 but much more
 joe biden made them go out and fire the prosecutor on tape
 but they don't want to show the tape
 i had to put it up on my social media site
 they don't want to show the tape where he was bragging
 you're not going to get this money unless they get rid of … and boom they got rid of the prosecutor
 he was investigating the son and the son's company
 got rid of him
 now that's what you call quid pro quo
 while these charges are totally unsubstantiated
 these are the fake newsers out there
 and then biden flew
 think of it
 he goes into a tough place
 we just met such a great deal with china
 just think of this
 my guy said if we could get 20 billion in agricultural product that would be good
 the most china ever did was 16 billion for our farmers
 okay
 we're just talking about the farmers
 we did banking
 we did everything
 but we're talking about them
 the most they ever did was 20 billion of product from our farmers
 our great farmers
 our patriot farmers
 our farmers that never left us even though they were being targeted by china
 they never left me
 so they wanted 20 in china agreed
 i said nope no good
 i want 50 billion not 20 billion
 50
 so my guys say sir we have a problem sir
 our farmers cannot produce that much
 it's true
 i said tell them to go out and get bigger tractors right
 john deere case caterpillar all american
 only american tractors
 we only buy american tractors
 go out and get bigger
 so now china's agreed
 they've already started buying
 hopefully the agreement gets signed sometime prior to a big summit that we have with president xi and others in chile
 that's in about four weeks
 but they give this
 they said sir they can't produce 50 billion
 i said i want the farmers to tell me … remember the story about winning
 we're going to win so much
 we're going into the white house
 we're going to tell the president sir we just can't stand winning
 the state of texas john cornyn and ted cruz they're going to come into my office
 sir we just can't stand this winning in texas anymore
 it's too much
 we can't handle it
 well that's what i want from the farmers
 i want the farmers to say
 i want the farmers to say sir we just can't produce that much product
 we can't do it sir
 and i'm going to say yes you can
 and they're going to say no we can't
 i'm going to say yes you can
 and they're going to go out and they get to take in 50 billion from china as opposed to 20
 that's what's going to happen
 that's what's going to happen
 but they were great
 they stuck with us through thick and thin
 now it's really working out for a lot of different groups
 in the meantime we've taken in tens of billions of dollars of tariffs and china's eaten the cost because they devalued their currency and they put money out
 tens of billions of dollars
 it's cost us nothing
 billions and billions and billions
 you know what i did for the farmer
 during the lean times i gave them 16 billion last year and 12 billion the year before
 28 billion altogether came out of the tariffs that i had a lot of money leftover and nobody complained
 you know our farmers didn't want that money
 our farmers didn't want it
 true story
 everybody comes for money
 countries come for … everybody wants money right
 they all want our money
 the farmers said sir we don't want this money
 it's a subsidy
 we don't want it
 i said no it's not a subsidy
 you're being targeted unfairly
 they said no sir it's a subsidy
 this is true
 i had 35 farmers in the oval office
 incredible people
 they didn't want it
 they said sir just give us a level field
 so now i gave them a field that's more than level
 it's level like this
 nice and easy
 nice and easy
 but the farmers i call them the great patriots the farmers
 i never lost them
 they always said yeah i'm in trouble
 i got a problem
 but this should have been done many many years ago by other presidents and other leaders
 and we lose for many years 500 billion a year with china and many other countries we lose billions
 we lose with everybody
 but that's all changing now
 but we lose 500 billion not million
 500 millions is a lot right
 we lose 500 billion
 and you know what
 it's a disgrace that that was allowed to go on for 25 years
 it was a disgrace
 disgrace
 but now we're taking in billions of dollars
 they've had the worst year they've had in 27 years and we're having the best year we've ever had
 so that's good
 that's good
 so biden flew with hunter on air force 2
 they flew to china
 hunter walked out of the plane had a quick meeting walked away with one and a half billion dollars
 these characters back there said oh that's okay
 there's no problem
 can you imagine if don or eric trump or ivanka trump who's here someplace … right here
 and by the way our great first lady is home watching this
 she said this is the most exciting thing i've seen in a long time
 you're a great first lady
 doing a great job
 she's doing a great job
 we're doing a great job
 the whole country now is doing a great job
 so biden takes 1500000000 and he goes on and he allows china to rip us off
 remember he said a year ago
 no no china's good
 they've done nothing wrong
 they are wonderful people
 they are all wonderful people
 i don't blame china by the way
 i blame our leaders for allowing this horrible you know what and pillage
 it's the r word
 you know what and pillage
 you know what word i'm talking about right
 i don't want to use it because they'll say it's a horrible word that trump used
 so the biden's got rich while america got robbed
 tonight we forcefully condemn the blatant corruption of the democrat party and nobody ever pays the price with the democrats
 they're so deep seeded
 they never pay the price
 they never pay
 but maybe soon that will start
 you know we've had a lot of we've had a lot of obama people and clinton people and some to be honest with you we've had some pretty bad republicans down deep that didn't exactly love us
 but slowly they're getting out
 they have all sorts of protections
 he says get rid of them
 yeah we're trying
 get rid of them
 but their partner in the whole thing is the fake news media
 that's the problem
 because the democrats and the fake news media it's a partnership
 remember that
 and you see it all the time and i've never seen it to this extent
 you know when i won in the primaries and then i won the election i was treated horribly by the media horribly
 and then when i won the election we had the greatest night one of the highest rated nights in the history of television all over the world
 and i won
 and i said oh the great thing
 i said to ivanka i said to the first lady i said to anybody that would listen i said listen this is so great
 finally finally we all of us we're going to be respected by the media
 and you know what happened
 they got worse
 they're worse now than they ever have been
 they're crooked as hell
 they're worse now than they've ever been
 they're crooked
 the only message these radicals and they are radical lefties will understand is a crushing defeat on november 3rd 2020
 save that date
 with your help we will win back the house
 we … with your help we will win back the house we will keep the senate and we will keep the white house in numbers like they haven't seen in a long long time
 joining us tonight are many terrific republican leaders and they are terrific
 and frankly if they're not i'm not going to introduce them okay
 but we have some great leaders and you have great leaders in texas
 great leaders and they love texas
 a friend of mine a guy that a lot of people weren't so sure we had this unbelievable relationship
 in fact when ted cruz held a rally in washington he said could you come to my rally
 and everybody thought these people thought that was strange
 they said to me well when is the fighting between these two
 because we really like each other
 when's the fighting going to start
 right ted
 they said when is the fighting going to start
 and i said don't worry it'll start
 and when it does it's going to be vicious
 and it was vicious and now we love each other again
 he's great
 ted cruz
 and he had a great victory against a man that spent almost 100 million dollars
 that's a lot of money
 spent almost 100 million but that was a great victory
 thank you ted
 another man who's currently running against somebody
 i kept thinking maybe beto will jump in because he's at zero right now
 we hope he's going to jump in
 remember no religion and no guns
 i think that's not good
 oh and i think he's like pretty light on oil production too
 but a man and john i have no idea who you're running against but nobody's going to be able to beat john cornyn

 rnc co-chairman tommy hicks a real friend of ours
 thank you tommy
 and our great campaign manager the most sophisticated man with a computer you've ever seen
 remember they used to say with hillary her campaign is so sophisticated
 then after she lost they said trump's campaign was so sophisticated
 and remember she spent like six times more on this stuff than we did
 you know the old days my father taught me if you can spend less that's a good thing not a bad thing right
 my father said if you can spend less
 so we spent much less then hillary crooked hillary crooked hillary
 where are those emails hillary
 they may find those 33000 emails
 they're looking they may find those deleted emails
 they may find them
 remember the emails 33000 emails covering her gym and her daughter's wedding 33000 that's a lot of emails for a wedding and working out
 but brad parscale did a great job
 thank you brad thank you
 thank you brad
 and secretary of commerce one of the legends of wall street he was really like amazing and he is doing an incredible job wilbur ross
 thank you wilbur
 smart guy
 and a friend of mine he's another one
 he was so tough
 he was nasty man
 boy he hit me during the campaign
 i said that guy's ruthless
 and when it was sort of over there was nobody more gracious and i called him i made him secretary of energy he's done a phenomenal job
 and rick perry couldn't have done a better job truly truly
 and he's going to be leaving at the end of the year and probably coming back here
 whatever he does it's going to be successful
 but he spent three years with us and i want to thank you rick what a job you done thank you
 what a job he's done
 he was also a great governor of texas that you know
 in everything we do we're fighting for the faithful citizens of this country
 this includes putting a stop to the catastrophic era of endless wars
 endless wars they don't stop
 they don't stop
 they go on forever
 we become policemen
 we end up becoming police were policing these countries
 that's not what it's about
 we've spent eight trillion dollars in the middle east
 thousands of american soldiers have lost their lives
 tens of thousands more have been severely wounded and in all fairness the other side has lost millions of people
 millions millions of people think of it
 these wars brought mass chaos instability destruction and death
 today we choose a different path
 we had tremendous success today
 i don't know if you've seen it
 we built in the last three years we built the strongest military by far
 and i told this story i was embarrassed to tell it but now i'll tell when i first got in a general told me we could've had a conflict with someone said sir we don't have ammunition
 and i said i never want to hear a president … i just never want to hear somebody have that statement made to them again as president of the united states we don't have ammunition
 think of how bad
 now we have so much ammunition we don't know what to do with it
 and as you all know i guess you've been watching today
 i sent vice president pence and secretary of state pompeo to lead an american delegation to meet with president erdogan of turkey
 they got there today and it did work
 without spilling a drop of american blood not one drop of american blood
 we've all agreed on a pause or a ceasefire in the border region of syria and it was unconventional what i did
 i said they're going to have to fight a little while
 sometimes you have to let them fight a little while
 then people find out how tough the fighting is
 these guys know right up here these guys know right
 sometimes you have to let them fight like two kids in a lot
 you got to let them fight and then you pull them apart
 but it was unconventional but they fought for a few days and it was pretty vicious
 and the kurds who are our friends and turkey's our friend
 but they fought it was tougher
 i mean it was nasty and you couldn't make a deal for 15 think of it for 15 years 20 years they couldn't make a deal
 the kurds didn't want to move
 turkey didn't want to budge and turkey was having a lot of bad things happen from this region
 in all fairness to turkey they were having a lot of bad but they didn't … now all of a sudden they're fighting and it's not fun having bullets going all over the place
 and we went there and we said we want to pause and the kurds have been terrific
 they're going to move back a little bit
 we're going to keep isis all nice and locked up okay
 we're going to find more of them
 and turkey's all set and president erdogan one was great and we're going to take the worst sanctions and tariffs and everything that i put on the country we put the worst i mean i don't think they could have economically survived but that doesn't matter
 president erdogan was a gentleman
 he understood it but without a little tough love
 you know what tough love is right
 without a little tough love they would have never made this deal
 president obama lost a million people in the area a million people a million people
 so now we're doing a five day period we're going to see if we can get it all finalized and i think it will be i think it will be
 so turkey's going to be happy
 the kurds are going to be happy isis is going to be unhappy
 we'll deal with whoever we have to deal with but we'll get it done
 and it's a great tribute to a lot of very talented people and thank you to vice president pence and thank you to mike pompeo
 good job good job and they're traveling back to our country by night
 they're traveling back and they'll be back soon and we'll have a big conference on it
 but it was a terrific thing and we've taken care of a lot of religious persecution
 we added that in
 a lot of things are in that agreement that nobody ever thought possible
 so we have to fundamentally change our approach to homeland security as an example
 in that example nobody would've ever done that
 you have to be a little bit different to do it that way
 i took a lot of heat even from some of our congressman even from some of our senators but now they're all happy and i'm happy with them
 i'm happy with them
 now i don't know what about the democrats
 the democrats will say oh what a terrible … anything we do the democrats will criticize
 if i said like on the china deal we get beijing for one dollar
 they would say what a terrible deal
 it just doesn't work with them
 you know the wall
 we spend so much time with them on the wall and i realized about two weeks ago all i had to do is say we will never build a wall
 and they would have come through and they said we demand that you build it
 it would have been so much easier right
 would have been so much easier ted would've been so much easier
 american combat troops should not be at the center of ancient sectarian conflicts all over the world
 bring our soldiers back home
 bring our soldiers back home
 the same people pushing us to fight endless wars overseas want us to open our borders to mass migration from these war torn and terror afflicted regions
 their policies would import terrorism right onto our shores with american issued visas
 oh isn't that wonderful
 and by the way the democrats want open borders
 they want everybody to flow in
 they want those caravans to flow in the caravans
 and they wouldn't get rid of the loopholes
 but you know what
 mexico's been great
 mexico today had 27000 soldiers on our border and we've stopped this horrible migration of people
 and many of them are bad people
 you know when countries send them up they're not sending their finest okay use your heads they're not sending their finest
 you've got to see some of the people
 but now we send them back
 and by the way ice is fantastic
 they've taken out thousands and thousands of ms-13 killers
 they've taken thousands of killers and brought them back
 and now we've made deals with guatemala and honduras and el salvador and mexico
 but we've made deals now where we can bring back there are 45000 people waiting in mexico
 but it's going to be very tough for these people ever to get back
 when did you ever hear that
 used to have no people waiting in mexico
 they just flooded
 our borders are getting strong
 when the wall is complete there'll be as strong as any borders anywhere in the world
 my administration believes in a simple principle the best way to keep foreign terrorists out of america is deny them just deny them admission in the first place
 it's really pretty simple
 and that is why i have imposed and we had passed and we won at the united states supreme court a travel ban on some of the world's most dangerous countries and places
 but if democrats seize power they would throw the floodgates wide open wide open
 we would have people coming into our country look at what's going on in california and the people of california don't want it they say come into california
 we'll give you free healthcare free education
 why wouldn't … i may even move to california if they keep going
 no but all it does is it brings everybody in
 what's wrong with these people
 we're rebuilding our military stronger than ever before and we are not going to deplete it again on stupid senseless endless wars
 we've invested more than two and a half trillion dollars restoring our armed forces and all of it was built in the usa and that includes approving the construction of almost 200 f-35 fighters stealth stealth
 and many of them are built right here right here
 you know that right in fort worth
 as we restore our security we're also restoring our prosperity
 america is winning again and america is respected again
 and by the way i have to say this so outside they have close to 30000 people
 and i wonder if i could ask the fire marshal fill up this little area let them in it would be so nice
 you know they have a certain max we broke the record tonight
 good place
 last month unemployment reached its lowest level in 51 years
 seven million americans have been lifted off food stamps since the election
 what a great … one point three million children have been lifted out of poverty think of that
 and african american hispanic american and asian american unemployment rates have reached the lowest levels in history
 our great hispanic american population has reached a poverty level which is a all time low in u
s
 history
 and after years of stagnation wages for hispanic americans are rising fast up nearly eight percent since my election and everybody in the fake news would have said that's absolutely impossible
 medium income think of this median income for hispanic americans has surpassed 50000 a year for the first time ever
 with republicans in congress we passed the largest package of tax cuts and reform by far in american history
 by the way the democrats want to raise your taxes you know
 i don't mean a little bit
 i don't mean a little bit
 i mean like double them up triple them up and it's still won't pay for the nonsense they want
 we eliminated a record number of regulations and we ended the war on a thing called american energy which is very good for texas
 since my election natural gas production in texas has increased 35 and oil production has increased by 60 six oh
 and the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world world
 yet every major democrat running for president wants to abolish all production of oil and natural gas
 i think they want to go to windmills windmills you know
 darling i want to watch trump speak tonight
 we can't darling the wind isn't blowing
 they want windmills
 in other words they want to annihilate your texas economy
 can you imagine
 no more oil no more natural
 so here we have a few people right
 no guns no religion no oil no natural gas
 abraham lincoln could not win texas under those circumstances
 couldn't do it couldn't do it ted
 couldn't do it louis
 abraham lincoln honest abe couldn't do it louie right
 remember i used to say i can be more presidential look
 i've always said i can be more presidential than any president in history except for honest abe lincoln when he's wearing the hat
 that's tough that's tough
 that's a tough one to beat
 no it's much easier being presidential is easy
 all you have to do is act like a stiff look
 remember the last election they said these phonies in the back they said texas is in play
 they said you'd toss in play too
 and i came here we had rallies like this
 thousands of people outside that couldn't get in
 and i said why is texas in play
 they say because it's voting it's suppression
 they try and get your hopes down
 they're suppressed
 this is just like fake news
 but they said texas they said texas is in play
 ladies and gentlemen texas is play
 this is cnn texas is in play
 president trump … and i had guys on from texas and they're wearing cowboy hats
 sid and a lot of guys
 they go i don't know about you but i know something about texas and donald trump is not going to lose texas
 i can tell you that and texas is not in play
 00 o'clock and usually they have to take hours and sometimes at least even if it's big they take a half an hour
 the texas polls have closed and usually if it's close it takes hours
 and if it's not even just like so close it takes a long time
 so they go ladies and gentlemen the polls have closed in the state of texas
 donald trump has won the state of texas
 right donald trump
 and we won by a lot
 we won by a lot
 and we won florida and we won south carolina and we won georgia and we won north carolina and we won pennsylvania
 we won a lot
 remember these phony people there is no way to get to 270 you had to get to … so i kept going to maine
 i love maine but maine too you get one
 it's cut in half
 maine too you get one
 i went there four or five times because … they got me up the phonies they got me up to 269 couldn't get to 270 so i went … i won by the way i won maine too
 i got one
 but i went there and i went there a lot
 that's the beautiful thing about the electoral college you go everywhere
 you don't just spend the three … winning the popular vote would be much easier
 i'd rather have that
 i'd go to four states and relax
 i went to 21 states
 i used to be a believer in the other but i think winning … it's like you're a track star
 you're working out for the a hundred yard dash or the mile it's a different form of training
 it's a different form
 but we did great
 they said he cannot get to 270 and they were right
 we got to 306
 after decades of economic surrender i have taken historic action to confront china's- … have taken historic action to confront china's rampant trading abuses and we've made great progress
 and our relationship with china is fantastic and great things are happening
 you watch
 they get it now
 they get it
 and a lot of good things are happening
 we're replacing nafta with disastrous i mean it's been to me probably … i used to call it the worst trade deal in history
 i think the world trade has been … wto what a real beauty the world trade organization
 that's a real beauty
 they consider china a developing nation
 and because you're a developing nation ted right
 they consider china to be a developing nation and because they're developing they get tremendous … and we wrote them letters
 we don't consider them to be a developing nation
 we don't consider india to be a develop… because they're ripping us off
 and we didn't win any cases at the wto and now we just won 7
5 billion of countries that were taking taking advantage of us
 and we've won a lot of cases lately
 we didn't win anything for years practically
 now we've won a lot of cases
 you know why
 because they know i'll leave if they don't treat us fairly
 they know it
 and then the piggy bank is gone where they all rob from
 we're replacing the nafta disaster
 and we have to get this crazy nancy pelosi to put this thing up for a vote
 we have to get her
 and the usmca is a giant victory for texas farmers ranchers manufacturers workers and oil
 the democrats should pass it overwhelmingly
 they will
 but nancy has to put it up for a vote
 do-nothing democrats
 they're do-nothing
 nowhere is the democrat betrayal of our nation more dramatic than on immigration
 in recent debates did you see these debates
 do you believe what i'm competing with
 i don't know when i had to compete with ted cruz that was brutal
 he was the national debate chamption a story i've never told
 i never did that before right
 i ran for office
 all of a sudden i'm supposed to be debating tomorrow night
  who are these people
 the hell i don't know all of them
 i know a lot of them
 i contributed to a lot of them
 they used to treat me very nice when i contributed to them
 not so nice when i was their opponent that changed a lot
  let me see i want to see who are these people
 i'm going to a debate
 i never debated
 my whole life has been a debate but i never debated with a podium and this and that
  who are they
 and we had 17 people plus me
 we had 18
 it was actually not 17 it was 18
 remember gilmore
 nobody remembers him
 but we had 18 people
 i said who are these people
 are they any good at debating
 and i hired a debate coach and he lasted for about 10 minutes
  this guy knows less than i do
 he didn't know anything
 he didn't know anything it's true
 he said never ever interrupt while they're speaking
  okay coach
 put me in coach
 and after a couple of those statements i mean … i mean you can't beat ted cruz if you don't interrupt him
 it's impossible
 but my first … it's true
 so i see let me see the cards
 let me see the whole thing
 i want to see it
 i need help
 i'm going to be debating in front of millions of people
 and everyone's saying do you think trump's going to be able to debate professionally
  let me see these cards
  you know he was president of his class
 one guy was a good debater in college
 he was this he was okay
 but they give me the first card ted cruz and it says national debate champion from princeton
 is that right
 and then national debate champion from harvard
  my potential first lady i got a problem
  some of these guys are okay
 they were only president of the class
 almost all of them ran for president of the class
 i never did
 i liked playing baseball better
 but i said melania and i called ivanka i called my kids i said i got a problem
 ted cruz was the national debate he was the number one guy in college
 he was the number one guy in law school
 how the hell do i beat a guy that's that good at debating
 but we came out okay ted
 and ted ted was tough
 smart as hell and tough
 tough
 good man
 but it is true
 the first card i looked at seriously it was ted cruz
 and he was literally i mean national debate he was the best in all of college and in law school
 and he's a talented guy
 no he says
 i don't think so
 every single democrat candidate for president raised their hand in favor of giving free healthcare to all illegal aliens
 they want to give more to illegal aliens than they give to american citizens
 you see that
 as president i will never allow the democrats to take away your healthcare dollars and give them to people that are in our country illegally
 can't do it
 in fact i just signed an executive action to protect american healthcare benefits for all american citizens
 among those hardest hit by illegal immigration are millions of legal immigrants right here in texas including millions of patriotic hardworking mexican-americans who play by the rules pay their taxes follow our laws and strengthen our communities
 whether you are a first-generation or tenth-generation and every american citizen and you do you've been treated so badly
 but you're not being treated badly anymore
 you know
 we got rid of the individual mandate from crazy obamacare
 every american citizen deserves a government that defends your jobs your safety your family your borders and is always loyal to you for a change
 we're loyal to you
 my administration has reduced illegal border crossings by over 60 since may
 and that's with no help from the democrats
 they won't close up the loopholes
 they won't close the loopholes and we could do it in 15 minutes
 and we're building the wall and we're doing all of these things but the democrats won't close up the loopholes
 you know what the loopholes are right
 how about catch and release
 you catch them
 you say hello darling how are you
 could you please give us your name and phone number
 they don't have a phone
 could you give us your address
 they don't want to have that have a phone
 could you give us your address
 they don't want to have an address that's in honduras
 could you please give us your address and your name
 they can't
 they say that's okay
 we catch and we release and they go into our country
 and then we are getting them out of the country
 and you know what
 some are very good people
 some are unbelievably dangerous and bad people
 and we're focusing on the bad and they're getting the hell out of our country
 okay
 while we're fighting for shared priorities the american people the democrat party has never been farther outside of the mainstream
 they've gone nuts
 every democrat running for president is pushing a healthcare agenda that would utterly eviscerate medicare
 my administration will always protect medicare for our beloved seniors
 and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions
 our ambitious campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs has produced the largest decline in drug prices in over 51 years
 people don't talk about it
 the press will not talk about it
 we have news conferences
 we tell them this they will not put it in the press
 you have no idea how dishonest the media is
 you have no idea
 virtually every top democrat also now supports late-term abortion ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up until the moment of birth
 and that crackpot governor from virginia executes the baby after birth
 you saw that right
 after birth
 you remember that one from last year
 that's why i've asked congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from god
 democrats are now the party of crazy politicians high taxes high crime open borders late-term abortion socialism and blatant corruption
 they're corrupt like schiff is corrupt
 he's corrupt
 the republican party is the party of the american worker the american family and it's the party of the american dream
 it's also the party of honest abe lincoln
 we forget that
 we got to use that more often
 don't you think
 honest abe
 i liked honest abe
 we've confirmed … he says honest donald
 thank you
 explain that to them
 you're right
 we've confirmed 152 federal judges to apply the law as written including two supreme court justices neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh
 when i got into office they say the most important thing a president can do i actually think it's defense but they say is the appointment of federal judges
 so when i got in always when you get in there are none
  how many do you have
 i have none
 none
 so i got to i say how many federal judges do i have
 sir you have 142 federal judges
 no you don't understand the question
 that's impossible
 that would mean that president obama didn't appoint 142 judges
 you get none
 or you're doing a bad job as president because you're representing a different philosophy
 very different
  actually sir the number is 142
 we were right the first time
  obama was … he's such a wonderful president
 how are you a wonderful president when the most important thing you can do you handed over to the republicans
 142
 how is that good
 i mean how is that good
 if i were a democrat i wouldn't be too happy about that number
 and we'll have a record number of judges by the time our term is over in 16 years maybe 20
 i'm only kidding
 i'm only kidding because every time i do that they say see he's assuming control
 we have this crazy guy on television
 and he goes you know … he's talking to a guest he goes you know he's going to win don't you
 you know he's going to win
 i mean we've done a good job
 he should be happy
 but he said  our military our schools our this everything
 he says you know he's going to win
 and the guest goes well no we're going to fight
 we're going to fight
 no no he's going to win
 and you know he's never leaving
 you know that don't you
 he's never leaving
 he's never going to leave
 and i thought this wacko was kidding
 he's a comedian
 i thought he was kidding
 he's serious
 he really believes that
 we passed for the veterans va choice and va accountability on behalf of those great people
 they've been trying to pass it for almost 50 years
 they couldn't get it done
 but those guys right there and me we got it done
 and to protect american security i withdrew the united states from the horrible one-sided iran nuclear deal
 i recognized israel's true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem
 and we also recognized israeli sovereignty over the golan heights
 for years you watched as your politicians apologized for america
 you've seen it many times
 oh i'm so sorry
 now you have a president who's standing up for america and standing up for your great state of texas
  about you
 i'm doing this for you
 you know we had in 2016 i really believe it was maybe the greatest election
 i guess george washington was good right
 but that was easy
 and by the way he did even better percentage-wise in judges than i did
 he had 100
 but we could have 50
 that's not bad
 and i had many more than he had
 so i guess you got to give george washington what do you think ted you got to give him something
 i'd say honest abe that was a pretty good election right
 andrew jackson they say ours topped andrew jackson
 but andrew jackson was a good election
 but we had among the greatest elections of all time
 but we have to now cement that election
 we got to cement it
 and once we do it's going to be very hard to take this beautiful experiment apart
 that'll be very hard
 because it's all about your family
 it's all about your future
 and it's all about the future fate of our great country
 so important
 with your help we will lift millions of more citizens from welfare to work dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity
 together we will elect a republican congress to create a safe modern fair and lawful system of immigration
 and by the way thank you robert jeffress for being here wherever you may be in this massive … wherever you are robert
 where is he
 he got up he started saying he may not be the greatest person
 i said … this is like four years ago i see this guy what a mouthpiece this guy
 and he's a man of god
  he may not be the greatest he may not be the most perfect christian
 he may not know the bible as well as some of us but he's a leader
 and i love donald trump
  who is that guy
 i love that guy
 robert jeffress
 wherever
 he's a great guy
 got a big big group of people on sunday mornings too i can tell you
 we will enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with those beautiful words that beautiful phrase i love it made in the usa
 we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the aids epidemic in america in less than 10 years
 we're doing that
 who would have believed we could do that
 we're doing that
 and the previous administration spent no money on that and we're spending a lot
 but think of that
 who would have thought that we're going to end within 10 years the aids epidemic in our country
 who would have thought we've advanced that far
 we will defend privacy free speech free assembly religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms
 above all we will never stop fighting for the values that unite people all across our land and throughout the great state of texas
 this is a great state
 we support protect and defend the constitution of the united states
 we stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement
 thank you
 we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life
 we believe that faith and family not government and bureaucracy are the true bedrocks of our society
 we believe in the creeds of self-reliance personal responsibility and american independence
 we believe that children should be taught to love our country honor our history and always respect our great american flag
 loyal citizens like you helped build this country
 and together we are taking back this country our country
 we love our country
 we're returning power to you the american people
 that's what we've done
 from dallas to el paso from houston to austin from the red river to the rio grande this state was settled by some of the toughest men and strongest women ever to walk on the face of the earth
 texas
 this is the state where william travis james bowie and davy crockett made their last stand at the alamo
 this is the state where a small band of patriots at the battle of gonzalez armed with a single canon stared down a foreign army and declared  come and take it
  they loved their families they loved their country and they loved their god
 these courageous texas patriots did not shed their blood sweat and tears so that we could sit at home while others try to erase their legacy demolish our liberty and destroy our proud american heritage
 we will never ever allow that to happen
 with your help your devotion and your drive we are going to keep on working
 we are going to keep on fighting
 and we are going to keep on winning winning winning
 we are one movement one people one family and one glorious nation under god
 and together we will make america wealthy again
 we will make america proud again
 we will make america strong again
 we will make america safe again
 and we will make america great again
 thank you texas
 thank you
 
 thank you
