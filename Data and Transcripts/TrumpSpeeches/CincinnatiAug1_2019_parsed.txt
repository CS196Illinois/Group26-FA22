thank you all
 thank you very much
 thank you to vice president mike pence and hello cincinnati
 you know i used to work in cincinnati a place called swifton village
 you know what that is
 swifton village
 it was good and it worked out well and it gives you confidence when things work out well at a young age and look what happened to all of us right
 look what happened
 look what happened
 i was watching the so-called debate last night and i also watched the night before that was long long television
 the democrats spent more time attacking barack obama than they did attacking me practically
 this morning that's all the fake news was talking about
 it's all they were talking about
 that wasn't pretty
 no we're doing good
 it's great to be back in the state that i love
 i love this state
 very special
 very very special on the banks of the beautiful ohio river with the hardworking patriots of the american heartland
 thank you ohio
 we love you ohio
 we've got thousands of people standing outside and i asked the officials can we sneak some up along the aisles
 can they sit on the stairs
 but i'll tell you what this is some crowd some turnout
 we've sold tens of thousands of tickets
 and you know what the sale price is
 we keep it nice and low
 we keep it nice and low
 but there never has been a movement like this
 this is a movement the likes of which they've never seen before maybe anywhere but certainly in this country
 they've never seen anything like this before
 you came from the mountains and the valleys and the rivers and you came for … i mean look from wherever you came from
 there were a lot of you
 and they showed up on election day
 i'll never forget a wonderful congressman from tennessee
 they have early voting and one of the earliest places great state tennessee and he was in pennsylvania with me great state
 and he said you know sir i've been doing this for a long time but i've never seen people like this show up for early voting
 people that haven't voted in a long time because they didn't see anybody they wanted to vote for
 he said i've never seen it
 they have trump banners and trump hats and trump buttons
 i've never seen it
 this great congressman said i don't know sir but i can tell you one thing
 if the rest of the country is voting like tennessee is voting you're going to win by a lot
 and we won and we won by a lot
 we won by a lot
 our nation is stronger today than ever before
 the number one economy on earth
 no economy is so strong
 we're rebuilding the awesome might of the united states military and soon it will be stronger relatively speaking than at any time in our history and when we took over it was depleted
 we took over a depleted military
 it's not depleted anymore i can tell you that
 our spirit is strong
 our stride is back and our stand is clear
 we are finally putting america first
 it's about time
 we've created six million new jobs since election day
 nobody would've thought that was possible
 more than seven million americans have been lifted off of food stamps and they're happy
 they're happy
 123000 more ohio workers are employed today than when i was elected
 think of that number
 and right now ohio is the most successful it's ever been in the history of our country
 thank you
 congratulations ohio
 stand up mike
 and you have a good governor
 i want to tell you that
 good job
 mike
 unemployment has reached the lowest rate in over half a century and unemployment for african-americans hispanic-americans and asian-americans have all reached the lowest rates ever recorded
 while republicans are working every day to build up our country the rage-filled democrat party is trying to tear america apart
 the democrat party is now being led by four left wing extremists who reject everything that we hold dear
 no one has paid a higher price for the far left's destructive agenda than americans living in our nation's inner cities
 they have paid a dear price
 do you see what's happening
 you see our inner cities we spend billions and billions and billions for years and years and years and it's stolen money and it's wasted money and it's a shame
 for decades these communities have been run exclusively by democratic politicians and it's been total one party control of the inner cities
 for a hundred years it's been one party control and look at them
 we can name one after another but i won't do that because i don't want to be controversial
 we want no controversy
 no controversy
 the democrat record is one of neglect and corruption and decay
 total decay
 the democrats have tax and regulated jobs and opportunity out of these cities and out of existence
 they've squeezed the blood out of them
 left wing mayors and city councils have opposed school choice trapping children and failing in government schools left and right
 so many of these mayors right now you know where they are
 they're in jail that's where they are
 republicans believe that every parent has the right to send their children to the school of their choice but the greatest betrayal committed by the democrats is their support for open borders
 these open borders would overwhelm schools and hospitals drain public services and flood communities with poisonous drugs
 it's tough enough and i want to thank by the way the country of mexico
 they've got 21000 soldiers on the border right now
 i'm starting to like mexico a lot
 they do a lot more for us than the democrats do right
 a lot more a lot more
 and the numbers are way down
 you'll see that
 way way down
 democrat lawmakers care more about illegal aliens than they care about their own constituents
 they put foreign citizens before american citizens
 we're not going to do that
 572 people were murdered in chicago last year
 so you got a lot of hot people outside but we broke the all time record
 the homicide rate in baltimore is significantly higher than el salvador honduras guatemala
 i believe it's higher than … give me a place that you think is pretty bad
 give me a place
 the guy says afghanistan
 i believe it's higher than afghanistan in our country
 think of that
 i believe we'll check the numbers and if we're wrong they will tell us tomorrow
 it'll be headlines
 trump exaggerated
 i do believe the rate is higher than afghanistan yet democrats and they've run it for many years want to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on illegal migrants instead of supporting their own struggling communities
 no good no good
 the conditions in nancy pelosi's once great city of san francisco are deplorable
 they're deplorable
 do you remember the word deplorable
 do you remember when hillary used the deplorable
 she used two words
 she used deplorable and irredeemable right
 and only being a politician for a few years
 i said what a terrible mistake that she used the word irredeemable but it turned out to be deplorable
 deplorable was not a good day for hillary
 crooked hillary
 she is a crooked one she's crooked
 she is crooked
 nearly half of all the homeless people living in the streets in america happen to live in the state of california
 what they are doing to our beautiful california is a disgrace to our country
 it's a shame the world is looking at it
 look at los angeles with the tents and the horrible horrible disgusting conditions
 look at san francisco
 look at some of your other cities and then you have a governor … you have a governor that invites the whole world to come into california
 we'll pay for your healthcare
 then you wonder why so many people are coming up
 they're coming up because we're the hottest economic country in the world but they're also coming up because you have people like that governor say come on up
 we'll give you healthcare
 come
 who wouldn't come up
 who wouldn't come up
 how crazy is this
 how crazy is this
 schools healthcare
 today i've a simple proposal for democrat leaders to support legislation to end illegal migration and we will use the vast savings to rebuild our inner cities
 that's the way we should be doing it
 that's what we should be doing
 by the way you know they keep talking about  oh the voters the voters the voters
 they want all sorts of security
 what about a thing called voter id
 voter identification
 rob portman please work on that rob portman
 you have a great senator
 would you please start working on that
 you see the response
 every place i go rob
 please rob
 voter id
 they give you everything they can give you except voter id and the things that matter
 republicans believe that a nation must care for its own citizens first
 our pledge to america's workers has secured commitments to train more than 12 millions americans for the jobs of tomorrow
 you know who's working very hard on that
 you probably never heard of her
 ivanka trump
 she's working very hard
 she gave up a lot
 she had a very easy life but she loves doing it
 she's got over i think now 12 million people
 they're teaching them the great companies of our country they're teaching people how to do it and it's an incredible thing to watch
 to give former prisoners a second chance at life we passed groundbreaking criminal justice reform that nobody could've passed except us
 president obama tried a lot of them tried they couldn't get it passed
 i got it passed with a lot of help from liberals and conservatives and a lot of help
 and the biggest beneficiary is the african-american community
 biggest beneficiary
 and something which a lot of people don't talk about but we doubled the child tax credit
 doubled it
 our tax plan also created nearly 9000 opportunity zones hottest thing going providing massive new incentives for investment in job creation in distressed communities
 left together i put out a six minute video detailing everything i found unacceptable about liberalism and the democrat party
 take your time
 take your time
 walk away
 doctor
 doctor in the house please
 okay
 thank you very much
 thank you very much
 thank you
 thank you
 thank you doctor
 thank you
 don't forget it's a hundred degrees in here
 that person's been standing there for almost a day if you think about it
 a lot of you so i appreciate it
 and you know what
 they'll come back
 they'll get a little something and they'll come right back because there's never been anything like this
 there's never been anything right
 never been
 thank you
 incredible
 we established more than 300 opportunity zones in ohio alone and these are really working out incredibly well
 nationwide nearly eight million african-americans live in opportunity zones but every democrat voted against them
 every single democrat because they vote as a block
 it's the only thing they do good
 they stick together
 their policies no good
 they're lousy politicians but they stick together like glue
 it's the only thing they have
 that's the only thing they have going
 democrats deliver poverty for their constituents and privilege for themselves
 republicans deliver jobs safety and opportunity for all americans
 we're thrilled to be joined tonight by many terrific republican leaders and we'll start off with a man who had a very very tough race for governor
 a lot of people choke
 they choke like dogs
 they can't breathe aw
 they can't breathe
 this guy was running against a so-called star … so that's two protestors and tomorrow night the headline will be protesters protesters
 you know what happened to the second one
 he looked at the guy in front of him and he said ah i'm out of here
 bye
 that's the way it works that's the way it works i guess
 too bad
 but a man who really has done a fantastic job he campaigned so hard and this was a star right from the fields of the great pocahontas whose now lying and cheating her way to the presidency if possible
 she's trying to win remember
 she defrauded people with her credentials
 she said she was indian and i said that i have more indian blood than she does and i have none
 i'm sorry
 we drove her crazy
 and we drove her crazy
 that's a good thing not a bad thing
 she went out and she had a blood test done and it came out 1024th
 he said  somewhere back there hundreds of years ago there may have been an indian
 or it may have been a statistical error because it was so small
 which it was
 anyway but the guy was from her group
 you wouldn't be very happy right now and we have a man that campaigned so hard relentless
 i came in we did a rally where we had people like this
 it was packed the day before the election and mike dewine won that election
 -and mike dewine won that election and he won it easily
 mike dewine
 we have a man who's running for governor of kentucky again
 and he's done an incredible job
 and did you ever hear sometimes you could do such a good job that not everybody appreciates it
 but they had a lot of problems with pensions and a lot of tremendous problems that a normal governor would never have been able to correct
 but when you correct it you make yourself a little bit less popular
 but he had no choice and they had no choice
 it's a great great state and he has turned out to be a great great governor
 matt bevin
 he's running in november and because i like him so much matt get a nice big arena ready we're going to do a rally for you
 and a man who's fantastic son is here tonight who i just met incredible
 when i ran with him he was down
 i said rob portman's down and then about four weeks later he was up by like 24 points
 i said what the hell did you do
 and you know what he did
 he does a great job
 that's what he did
 senator rob portman
 great guy
 and we have a few guys that these are warriors
 a couple of them you saw the other day they were questioning bob mueller
 that was a beauty
 he was sharp wasn't he
he was sharp as a tack and steve chabot and brad wenstrup and warren davidson and andy barr and a man named greg pence who happens to be a brother of somebody i know very well
 they have been with us through thick and thin and it has been mostly really good times because what we've done no other administration in the first two and a half years in history has done
 thank you fellas
 great job
 a couple of them gave a grilling
 they gave a grilling
 all they had to do is mention the facts and it was over
 and also the auditor of the great state of ohio a man whose job i made much easier because you have money pouring in
 you have companies pouring in
 keith faber
 how is it keith
 the numbers are good keith
 numbers are good right
 yeah
 the numbers are good
 ohio senate president larry obhof
 larry thank you
 great job
 nice tie
 i like larry's tie
 and you have a couple of people that are very very powerful
 i hear that office and i shudder ohio supreme court justices sharon kennedy and judy french
 thank you
 please don't recuse yourself because i gave you a nice welcome should i ever be before you
 i love judges
 when they see you for about two seconds and then you say oh that judge should be fair
 and then they say i'd like to recuse myself because 29 years ago i met donald trump
 i'd never have been in… we've been doing very well in the courts by the way
 have you seen
 we've been winning a lot of cases a lot of cases
 we really have
  179
 percentage wise it's the second most
 we will never be number one
 sadly we'll never be number one
 so percentage wise nobody's ever seen anything like it
 and that's because president obama basically was not able for about three years to get his people in which is a shame
 and i came in i had 148 openings
 you're supposed to have none
 i said how many do we have
 148
 and i said you got to be kidding
 and we've all done a good job together
 it's been amazing with mitch and you and everybody
 it's been amazing
 so we're going to be up to within two months 179 federal judges
 that's in two and a half years
 and what else
 two great supreme court judges
 great ones
 there's only one person
 i think most of you must know this
 who percentage wise has done better than me with judges
 tell me
 i'll give you a hint
 he appointed 100 of the federal judges and 100 of the united states supreme court
 george washington
 that's one record we're not going to beat
 but i appointed many more than him so let's take it that way
 many anymore
 i also want to introduce a friend of mine who's done an incredible job
 she's really something she has been incredible as a leader of the gop
 she's the chair and she's my friend jane timken
 and aman bob paduchik
 you know bob paduchik
 so bob i had to pick campaign manager in ohio and i kept hearing from the media you must win the state of ohio
 i heard this over and over for like a year and a half
 you must win ohio
 you must win
 so i had to pick a campaign manager and i picked a man named bob paduchik
 and no matter what happened no matter how badly we were doing he said sir you're going to win ohio easily
 i said but bob we just lost the head of the gop in ohio
 he left because you have a certain governor that asked him to leave
 great support from the governor a different governor than mike by the way slightly
 so he had to get out
 so i said we just lost
 and bob said don't worry about it sir
 you're going to win
 in fact i think you just went up
 then we lost a couple of other people
 i'd call him
 i say bob i'm worried about ohio
 very worried
 he said don't worry about it sir
 i think he just went up
 he kept saying you just went up
 i said to somebody i don't know much about this guy but boy he's the most optimistic person i've ever met
 true
 he said don't worry
 we ended up winning ohio by close to nine points which is unheard of
 he was right
 bob paduchik
 bob
 and also here tonight i don't know did he do a good job
 my son donald jr
 and kimberly
 i hope he did a good job
 good i heard you did
 i heard you did a great job
 he's been a great help
 they both have
 thank you very much
 thank you kimberly
 thank you very much
 our shared republican agenda is pro worker pro jobs pro family pro growth and 100 pro american
 we've eliminated a record number of job killing regulations giving the average american household 3000 more to spend every single year
 the previous administration tried to shut down american energy and close up totally close it up
 american clean beautiful coal
 that's what they did
 that didn't work out too well but you had a suffer
 it didn't work out well but get a suffer for a long time until i came along
 you're not suffering any longer
 the previous administration they liked to windmills
 if a windmill is within two miles of your house your house is practically worthless
 they make noise they're intermittent
 they kill your birds
 they break down all the time
 you have to replace them every 10 years because they wear out and they cost a fortune and they need subsidy
 other than that they're quite good
 you don't want one of those windmills within vision
 you hear them they're noisy
 they've got a lot of problems
 no we're going to say with the great energy that's powering our businesses that's creating so many jobs
 and solar you know what
 we'll live with solar but solar is peanuts by comparison to what you need
 but we're going to stay the way we have it
 we've ended the war on american energy and we're putting our coal miners back to work and our steelworkers back to work and our auto companies back to work
 we've learned over the last three years the incredible gold that were sitting on top of in this country
 we're very lucky
 we're now the largest energy producer in the entire world bigger than soviet union formerly
 remember the soviet union when it was all together
 the soviet union when it was all together before they decided we got to call ourselves russia
 when it was all together they wanted to be that was always their dream to be the biggest in the world
 then it became russia and you know what
 they've done a good job with energy and so has saudi arabia done a good job with energy
 but we're now bigger than russia
 we are now bigger than saudi arabia by far
 i withdraw our country from the job killing and very expensive paris climate accord
 last year coal export were up 92 compared to 2016
 92 do you believe that
 you're shipping it all over the world
 to vietnam
 i was in vietnam and they said we get coal from ohio
 we get coal from west virginia
 it's the finest coal in the world
 we've created more than 110000 new mining jobs and thanks to states like ohio the united states is now the number one producer of oil the number one producer of natural gas the number one everything having to do with energy
 number one
 anywhere in the world
 we're reversing decades of calamitous trade policies that led other countries to pillage our jobs plunder our factories and devastate ohio communities and communities in every state
 the era of economic surrender is over and when you look at what they've done to your jobs over a period of time nafta was one of the worst deals ever made and probably the worst deal
 you still have empty buildings empty factories but now they're getting filled up pretty fast or being knocked down for brand new ones
 we have hundreds of new companies pouring into the united states
 my first week in office i withdrew the united states from one of the last administration's worst sellouts
 it would have destroyed our automobile industry
 it would have destroyed manufacturing in this country and maybe that's what president obama meant when he said you can't produce manufacturing jobs anymore in the united states because he would've signed trans pacific partnership and he would've been right
 i killed it
 and by the way tpp trans pacific partnership would have destroyed the automobile industry in this country already
 already the shipped down 30 of your jobs to mexico
 under the new usmca
 that's mexico and canada
 we've got to get them to vote on that because that's an incredible deal
 but under the new… it's going to be very hard for companies to leave you to fire you to go down to make their product whatever it may be to send it back into the united states with no tax
 all we end up with this unemployment and taxes and empty buildings
 so they got to vote on the usmca
 before i took office foreign countries ripped us off robbed us blind and pushed us around but america is not being pushed around anymore
 do you realize that
 i got that from working in ohio for two summers
 we've taken the toughest ever action to stand up to china's trade abuse and i just announced another 10 tariff on 300 billion worth of chinese products that come into our country
 and that's on top of the 25 that we take off 250 billion coming in from china and don't let them tell you the fact is china devalues their currency
 they pour money into their system they pour it in and because they do that you're not paying for those tariffs
 china's paying for those tariffs
 for the last 20 years china's taken hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars out of our country and now we're stopping the theft of american jobs
 we're stopping the theft of so many other things happening including intellectual property
 they steal our intellectual property
 i think they want to try and make a deal with us but i'm not sure because the word is i feel they want to wait until they get… they're praying
 they're praying
 they would like to see a new president in a year and a half so they could continue to rip off the united states like they've been doing for the last 25 years
 would love to see a guy like sleepy joe biden who has no clue what the hell he's doing
 they say to sleepy joe
 sir just sign right there
 oh okay
 i'll sign
 we'll be losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year to china
 it has to stop but they understand that
 president xi is good man
 he's a friend of mine
 he understands it
 and until such time as there is a deal we will be taxing the hell out of china
 that's all there
  make your product in america
 come on back to the united states
 come on back to ohio
 there's no tariff
 there's no tariff
 thanks to steel tariffs hundreds of thousands of tons think of this were dumped on our shores and steel is like something else
 it's that quality
 they were dumping garbage they call it sand steel they call it dirt steel

 it was mixed up
 it was bad stuff and we didn't want to use that for our jet fighters and for our beams that hold up building
 but they were dumping tremendous quantities of steel and what was happening is united states steel and all of our companies were going virtually out of business and i stopped it
 i put on a 25 tariff billions of dollars is now pouring into our treasury and our steel companies and our steel workers are coming back
 right here in ohio
 nucor a great steel company and a steel company that's doing great again nucor has announced an 85 million upgrade in marion
 charter steel announced plans to build a new 150 million steel mill in cuyahoga heights and cleveland cliffs announced a new 700 million plant in a very good place that i like a lot toledo
 toledo ohio
 this was unthinkable because four years ago steel plans were closing
 they weren't expanding or they weren't building
 we're building new plants in florida north carolina south carolina all over
 not just ohio
 on issue after issue democrats have forgotten who it is that they're supposed to represent
 they forgot
 i wonder why they forgot
 the job of elected officials is to represent american citizens the radical democrats even support deadly sanctuary cities which release dangerous criminals onto our streets
 sanctuary cities
 many of the places that have sanctuary cities and many of the people that live there they don't want them
 they don't want them
 they're dangerous and not good
 here are just a few examples
 in san francisco an illegal alien was arrested no fewer than 10 times in the span of less than one year for numerous counts of burglary and theft
 yet each time san francisco defied federal authorities and set him free and bad things happened when they set him free
 a sanctuary jurisdiction in california recently released a criminal alien from jail
 the very next month the same individual was arrested for rape and then beyond anything you would even believe a horrible thing happened
 but yet again he was released back into your community
 after sanctuary city in new jersey released an alien charged with domestic violence he was arrested in missouri for the murders of three people
 in the bizarre worldview of the third and hard left they have no problem destroying the lives of innocent americans for a single politically incorrect thought
 but they want to virtually and you know this they want virtual immunity for illegal aliens who have committed horrible crimes and murder
 horrible crimes and murder
 republicans believe our cities should be a sanctuary for law abiding americans not criminal aliens
 and yes just won a big lawsuit last week
 in fact on of my lawyers for winning that lawsuit is here tonight
 i gave him a little reprieve
 we need a lot of lawyers in the white house
 we get sued so much so unfairly but we're winning those lawsuits left and right but one of them is here
 he said i'd love to go to a rally
 i said  i'm going to a place called cincinnati ohio
 you deserve it
 we just won the lawsuit on the wall
 where's pat
 we just won the lawsuit on the wall
 you hear that
 we're building the wall faster and better than ever
 it's time for democrats to end sanctuary cities and catch and release
 you know what you do
 you catch them and then you release them and you say would you please report back in four years from now
 but only 2 come back
 you know why
 because they're not the smartest
 they are not the smartest
 they're the ones we don't want to have come back
 only 2 show up
 catch and release we could end it immediately if the democrats caved
 so what we're doing is something else
 we're keeping them out altogether
 we're replacing random migraines and we're replacing the lottery system
 how about the lottery system
 how about lotteries
 this was chuck schumer
 you put the name in a basket
 the country puts the name in a basket and you picked people out of the lottery
 well let's see
 this one's a murderer
 this one robbed four banks
 this one i better not say
 this one another murder
 ladies and gentlemen another murderer
 think of this
 do you think they're going to put great citizens… they have great citizens they have great people like we have great people
 do you think those people are going into a lottery
 no
 and then we get these people coming in and we hold it against the country
 the country isn't based on that the country you just take a look look at the people they put into these lotteries
 it's a disgrace
 and how we've done this for so many years folks how we've done this
 it's an immigration system that's totally broken and we're going to win the house we're going to win the senate we're going to win the presidency and we're going to do a merit based immigration system
 merit based
 merit based immigration
 and we need that because we have companies coming in from all over the world and we need good workers
 we need good people
 we're down to 3
5 unemployment
 we need people but we want people to come in based on merit not based on some lottery put in by a governor
 democrats have never been farther outside the mainstream
 liberal politicians want to eliminate private- dream
 liberal politicians want to eliminate private healthcare and force everyone onto the government plan
 remember the lies from the previous administration
 if you like your plan you can keep your plan
 if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor
 28 time one lie after another
 28 times it was said and it turned out to be a total lie
 my administration is defending your right to choose the plan and doctor that is best for you
 we're offering right now plans up to 60 cheaper than obamacare and we will always protect patients with pre existing conditions
 always
 always
 virtually every top democrat also now supports late term abortion
 and then you'll have like a governor of virginia it's not only late term abortion it's killing the baby after the baby is born
 how about that
 think of that
 think of that
 that's why i've asked congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from god
 democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion and they're the party frankly of socialism
 the republican party is the party of freedom
 we're the party of the american worker the american family
 we're the party of the american dream
 i'm fighting for you each and every day
 i had a great life
 i used to get great publicity
 nobody got better… i had such a great life
 it was so easy
 my great wife the first lady melania she said you know you've always been a hard worker
 you love to work but your life was a lot easier in the old days
 but i love it and you know why i love it
 because we're accomplishing so much
 nobody ever thought it would be possible to do the things we're doing
 even a thing like right to try right
 right to try
 they've been trying to get that for years and years and years
 that's people that are really sick terminally ill
 they couldn't get medicine
 we have the greatest doctors the greatest clinics the greatest technicians in the world
 they couldn't get anything
 they'd traveled to asia if they had money
 they traveled to europe
 they'd travel all over the world hoping for a cure
 if they had no money they'd just go home
 they'd die
 they had no hope
 for 44 years they've been trying to get right to try
 we are so advanced in medicine
 we have a lot of things that probably work or possibly work but we weren't allowed legally to give that to these people that were so sick
 you know why
 because they didn't want this drug if it didn't work to hurt the people but the people were terminally ill
 so i got it approved and it wasn't easy
 it was complicated
 the insurance companies didn't want to do it
 the government didn't want to do it
 the doctors didn't want to do it
 tremendous liability
 but our country didn't want to do it
 they said well if it doesn't work we're going to get sued
 i say so they'll sign an agreement very strong one page taking all liability away from the united states from the drug companies from the doctors all liability
 they're terminally ill
 let's try it
 and you know what
 it's been a miracle
 so many people have done so well
 it's great
 we got it done
 when i set about the agreement they had these great lawyers and they said gee that's a good idea
 they'd been working in this few years
 they said that's a good idea
 i said yeah it's a good idea
 how about getting you to me like in about two hours
 right to try
 it's a great thing
 but we have so many things like that
 i have lists that you wouldn't even believe
 i have lists that go on for pages of things we've done
 we've launched a historic initiative to reduce the price of prescription drugs including a plan to allow companies to import lower cost drugs from other countries
 it's a very unfair system
 our country pays the highest prices in the world
 last year was the first time in 51 years that drug pricing for prescription drugs actually came down
 now we're going to bring it down by a lot
 we're going to bring it down a lot
 and now… so other countries… here's an example canada pays half the price for a lot of drugs that we do
 so we have a great governor in the state of florida ron desantis calls me up
 doing a great job
 ron desantis
 he was at three and he went to 70
 that's a pretty good increase right
 ron desantis a great governor
 and he comes to me he goes you know if you buy the drugs if we buy the drugs because this is so botched up we have a middleman
 it's not a good situation
 he said if i could go and buy the drugs from canada i could save 50
 i said do it
 do it
 and if you can buy them from europe because their system… like remember i used to scream when i was winning states and not getting the delegates that i was entitled to and i'd say the system is rigged
 well the drug system is rigged
 it's rigged
 so if we can buy the same drug made by the same pharmaceutical company from europe or from canada or from other places at a big deep discount we're doing it and we're giving them the right to do it
 just happened today
 and we're doing one other thing that believe it or not is even bigger but you'll be seeing that over the next two weeks
 with the help of your great senator rob portman we've taken bold action to confront the opioid epidemic and in ohio drug overdose deaths went down 22 last year 22
 no but think of that
 opioid big problem big problem
 deaths went down
 opioid deaths 22
 nobody writes that
 nobody talks about that
 they don't want to talk about that
 good job rob
 good job
 good job mike
 we passed va choice and va accountability on behalf of our great veterans
 they been trying to pass va choice for four decades
 they couldn't get it done
 we got it done
 we got it done
 this is where a veteran would stand online for three four five six days for three weeks for five weeks
 sometimes they're okay
 by the time they see a doctor they're terminally ill
 and i said you know i have a great idea
 because i not been doing that this long
 you know we've been working with this for… i've been thinking about it a lot
 this was during the campaign
 what a campaign that was right
 was that a campaign or what
 and i came back to my people
 i had experts and i said i have a great idea
 these lines for the veterans are too long
 it takes them three four weeks sometimes to see a doctor
 i have a great idea
 let's let them go outside
 go to a private doctor
 we'll pay the bill
 they'll be fixed up all perfect and they can do it immediately
 we'll pay the bill
 and i thought… i said man am i smart
 i am the smartest guy to think of that
 so i went before this panel of experts that were with me working on things and i said how do you like that idea
 and they said sir we've known about it for about 40 years but we've never been… i said really
 you've known about it that long
 but here's the thing
 we got it done
 nobody else could get it done
 nobody else
 and accountability
 you couldn't fire anybody
 if they were treating our vets badly you couldn't fire them for anything
 people could steal
 they could be sadistic to our vets
 by the way they wouldn't have done that in primetime to our vets
 i can tell you that
 they can be whatever they want
 you couldn't fire them
 and it was because of unions and it was because of other things
 civil service
 very tough
 you couldn't fire anybody for almost anything
 we had cases where people got… they got caught stealing a lot of money and you couldn't fire them
 we got va accountability
 now we say jim get the hell out of here
 you're fired
 we're rebuilding our military
 and after years of budget cuts and layoffs the army tank plant in… do you lima
 you call it lima right
 see
 you know most people call it lima but i know lima
 but you know why
 because i came here and they said we're closing this plant
 i said what kind of a plant is it
 remember when i was here
 in lima
 and i used to say you mean lima
 they said no sir
 it's lima
 that's why… because but leah hey look i'll be honest with you because they have it wrong with the teleprompter okay
 and i would have been in big trouble
 but the good news is i don't use the teleprompter too much
 if i did you would've been out of here a long time ago because it gets very boring when you do the teleprompter deal
 but in lima and i said what kind of a plant
 and i said let's go see it
 during the campaign i went to see it and they make the incredible the best army tank in the world and i couldn't believe the complexity the genius
 i said wait a minute
 you close this you'll never be able to open it again
 you can't open this
 this isn't like a normal situation that you can open four walls and a roof
 this is complicated
 this is genius and you'll never replace these men and women that work here
 i said… and i didn't know anything at the time other than i said you're not closing it
 they took it off to list
 they kept it open and now we're making army tanks around the clock
 we're investing in the future of human space flight
 americans won the race to the moon and we will now win the race to mars
 it's going to be amazing
 and you know one thing i have to say also and we're also winning the race to great great strategic defense and offense not just mars
 and mike pence is doing a great job on that
 great job
 to protect america's security i withdrew the united states from the horrible iran nuclear deal a horrible stupid deal
 we gave iran 150 billion
 we gave iran  1
8 billion in cash
 plane loads of cash
 i wonder what they saw when those planes landed
 i wonder what happened to the cash
 can you believe it
 one 1
8 billion we gave them in cash
 and remember what i said iran is a much different country than two and a half years ago
 when i took over iran was all over
 they had 14 to 18 different sites of confliction
 they were all over
 and now they just want to… they want a negotiated deal so badly
 iran
 iran
 i recognized israel's true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem
 and just a few months ago we recognized the golan heights
 you know that
 that's another one
 big one for the security of israel

 let's see what happens there
 let's see what happens
 tonight we renew our resolves that america will never be a socialist country
 never ever ever will it be a socialist country
 no matter what label they use a vote for any democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of our great our beautiful our wonderful american dream

 it's about you
 i say it again

 there's never been a movement like this
 they've had movements
 they never went… they won a state
 they did well in the state
 we won 32 states
 there's never been anything like it
 there's never been anything like it
 but this movement is about your family and your future and it's about the life and the fate of your country
 we begin our… hey look this is a good place
 is this a great thing to do
 we begin our campaign and we're going to do great bob
 right bob
 bob if we don't do great you're fired bob
 you're fired
 but think of it our ohio campaign with the best record the best results the best agenda and the only positive vision for our nation's future
 and again remember this ohio is doing better today than it's ever ever ever done before
 it's the best it's ever done
 what's going to do… a guy like a sleepy joe biden is going to come in and say but i could do better
 i could do better
 he wants to go back to sleep
 together we will continue unleashing the power of american enterprise so every american can reach their fullest and highest potential tremendous potential
 our country has such tremendous potential
 you know we've had… the last week we've had the highest stock market in the history of our country
 that means 401ks
 that means job
 but there's tremendous potential to go up
 we have tremendous potential to go up
 with your help we will elect a republican congress to create a safe modern fair and lawful system of immigration
 we will enact trade deals that ensure more products are proudly stamped with those four beautiful words made in the usa or made in america
 either one
 you can use either one
 made in america made in the us
 we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine and i see what they're doing
 i see it
 they show me the things we're doing in our country today
 there's never been anything like it
 we will be ending the aids epidemic shortly in america and curing childhood cancer very shortly
 we will defend privacy free speech religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms
 just remember with the democrats there is no second amendment
 you can forget about keep and bear arms
 you can forget it
 above all we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one america
 we will never ever stop fighting
 we support protect and defend the constitution of the united states
 we stand with our incredible heroes of law enforcement
 we believe in the dignity of work and we believe in the sanctity of life
 and we believe that faith and family not government and bureaucracy are the true american way
 we believe that children should be taught to love our country honor our history and always be proud patriotic americans
 and we will always live by the words of our national motto in god we trust
 two days ago i spoke at the 400th anniversary of the first representative legislature assembly at jamestown virginia
 it was beautiful
 it was incredible
 i was… i must tell you i was reminded of so many great things in our country
 we have been blessed with such a remarkable and priceless heritage
 we are the greatest republic on the face of the earth and we are going to keep it that way
 every day of my presidency we will never forget that we are americans and the future belongs to us
