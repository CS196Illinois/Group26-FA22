so thank you pennsylvania very much
 i'm thrilled to be in latrobe the home of the late great my friend arnold palmer
 what a great guy he was
 what a great guy
 thank you very much
 61 days from now we're going to win the commonwealth of pennsylvania and we are going to win four more years in the white house
 joe biden wants to surrender your jobs to china
 you know that
 his son walked out with a lot of money for doing nothing
 he wants to surrender your nation to the radical left wing mob
 he's trying to change now
 we say that's not working because we're going up and he's dropping like a rock in water
 and before the china virus this election was over
 now i had to go back to work and we've done a great job on it
 we don't get the credit
 we don't get the credit
 we made a lot of governors look very good
 but i will keep your jobs in america and i'll bring rioters looters violent extremists anarchists we will bring them to justice
 that's what we're doing right now
 we have over 400 right now under arrest
 these are bad people
 over the last three and a half years we've secured america's borders fixed our broken trade deals rebuilt the united states military obliterated the isis caliphate 100 secured american energy independence and built the single greatest economy in the history of the world and now we're going to do it again
 have to do it again
 have to do it again
 got to do it again
 and it's happening
 you see what's happening
 job numbers retail sale numbers they're all at records
 it's happening
 it's happening very fast
 it's actually happening in a super v not a v
 it's a super v and you'll see that and big numbers are coming out and have come out and just watch your set or watch your newspaper
 read your newspaper
 you're seeing numbers that congressmen we haven't seen those numbers ever before actually
 we've never seen them
 and by the way we have record stock markets
 we have record everything
 you're going to have an incredible economic year next year
 your stocks are going up
 your 401s are through the roof
 i had a little pause today
 people wanted to take some profits and probably somebody said something stupid along the way
 but the stock market's at record levels
 think of it
 in the hopefully rounding the turn on the pandemic we're rounding that turn and vaccines are coming along great
 the job that they've done the doctors everybody else we're years ahead of schedule
 anybody else's president you wouldn't be talking about vaccines for two or three years from now
 i'll tell you right now
 that i can tell you
 biden will never be able to protect your jobs or your family
 he is a puppet of the socialists marxists and the cop hating extremists
 and they are cop hating
 and we love our law enforcement
 we love our law enforcement
 and by the way i don't know if you saw this if there's any way of you seeing it we have thousands of people behind this hangar thousands and we're trying to get them in
 and i'd love to get them in
 i mean it's an airport
 let them go to the runways
 okay
 let them in
 i mean literally there we landed
 i actually thought that was the crowd
 we're doing the hanger thing now because the arenas can't do it because of the pandemic for a while a little while
 but in certain ways i like this better
 i don't have to travel
 i get off the plane
 i make a speech
 i get the hell out of here
 no these are great
 do you remember the last days before the campaign
 i'd do a lot of them a day
 get off that plane
 it was a little different plane
 it was black and white instead of the blue and white
 but we had some time
 and that was an important day and that was an important year 2016
 but i will tell you the election that we have coming up is the single most important election in the history of this country
 and we had a level of enthusiasm i mean even look today
 with all going on look at the kind of crowds we have
 but we had record enthusiasm in 2016
 by the way was that greatest evening ever
 november
 and now it's going to be november 3rd and we'll keep it going and we'll get it all like a tree
 you move that tree
 it takes a little while to plant your tax cuts
 they're going to raise your taxes
 they're going to take away your guns
 really if you look
 and you know they'll criticize me for saying this the fake news media which is back there with their fake polls
 the same as last year
 we could just put it all on tape
 the fake polls the fake everything
 you know they're called suppression polls
 they're meant to make you depressed
 are you depressed
 you don't look depressed
 we have the real numbers
 we're leading everywhere
 we are leading everywhere
 i'll tell you
 i think we're way ahead of what we were four years ago and there's far more enthusiasm
 our base is bigger
 it's stronger
 and we've done the greatest job
 again if we didn't get hit by the plague from china between us i would have canceled mr
 congressman most of the rallies
 i wouldn't have needed a rally
 that's a little bit unfair but that's okay
 that's what china's done to our nation
 they've screwed us for a long time on a lot of different ways
 never has anybody ripped off our nation like china and i've taken in billions and billions of dollars
 we never took in 25 cents from china
 and i gave 28 billion right 28 billion to the farmers because they were targeted unfairly by china
 and our farmers are very unhappy
 i don't think we have too many farmers in this wonderful pennsylvania town
 i know we have a lot of boilermakers over there
 we got a lot of boilermakers i'll be talking about them
 look at those guys
 nobody going to mess with them
 i'll tell you
 we're going to be talking about them in a minute
 but for the entire summer biden was silent as far left rioters viciously attacked law enforcement in democrat run cities all burned down businesses terrorized civilians and just recently marched through the streets chanting death to america
 this is what we have
 death to america
 and by the way we could end it like immediately
 you saw what we did in wisconsin
 it ended
 it took a while for the governor
 you know they have to ask us in
 it's like otherwise we have to do something much bigger and it's totally unnecessary
 the national guard is fantastic
 i went to see them two days ago
 biden went there today
 there was nobody there
 there was nobody there
 he was a little late
 i was going to say hey listen we ended that problem
 but we could end it in portland
 wise guys in portland
 anarchists
 they're agitators
 they're looters
 i'll tell you we could end it in portland in a half an hour
 we did it in seattle
 we told them we're coming in
 you either end it or were coming in
 congressman we were going in the next day
 we were all set
 i was actually disappointed to be honest
 they ended it in seattle
 they took over 20 of the city
 do you believe this
 and the mayor said no it's going to be a summer of love
 these people are crazy
 so we end them very quickly
 we end them very quickly
 and now what we're doing is we're holding back funds for cities that don't know what they're doing where they allow crime to run rampant
 and we put a 10 year prison sentence at anybody that knocks down a statue
 i took out an old ordinance a very old one because today in congress you don't get things like that today
 they think that you should just have no cash bail
 they do the no cash bail
 you kill somebody
 there's no bail
 don't worry about it
 go out
 but i took out an old ordinance
 i gave a new executive order
 it says 10 years in prison
 and amazingly amazingly that was three and a half months ago
 and they were having a big march on washington march elsewhere and amazingly that was the end of the statues coming down
 no statutes
 and we're actually prosecuting people for having done it
 we made it retroactive to the beginning
 terrible
 terrible
 and by the way the state statues and monuments they have to do the same thing
 it's real easy
 but the rioters that want biden to win they want him to win because their agenda it's what they want
 it's the craziest thing i've ever seen
 they both want to cut funding for police
 they want to end that cash bail
 they want to hire far left prosecutors and judges and let the criminals run wild
 the radical left district attorney in portland mike schmidt his name is has released hundreds of rioters that announced that anyone arrested for interfering with police officers disorderly conduct criminal trespass rioting and other offenses will not be prosecuted under any circumstance
 oh it's worse
 it's worse
 you have somebody in philadelphia who's worse right
 worse
 in his manifesto with bernie sanders that's what it is biden agreed to all these things
 you notice now no no
 i never said about fracking
 i never said
 if you don't do fracking in pennsylvania 900000 jobs and your energy bills will triple
 other than that i don't think you should have it
 okay
 no but he said in the manifesto plus he said many times we put on the clip yesterday where he no fracking no this no that i mean no guns
 how about guns
 no guns
 no second amendment
 biden has pledged to a point prosecutors who extend these insane far left policies nationwide
 that's what he's done
 that's called the manifesto
 he agreed to all this stuff
 the craziest thing you're supposed to bring it to the right
 he actually brought it further left
 bernie never dreamt that this was possible crazy bernie
 do you know crazy bernie
 i had a lot of his voters come to me four years ago a big percentage
 you know why
 because i agree with him and he agrees with me on one thing trade
 the trade
 because he knew that other countries are ripping us off and so did i
 nobody else got it
 especially biden never got it
 he never got it
 still doesn't get it
 now he really gets nothing
 i tell you
 he didn't get it in prime time
 now he really doesn't get it
 but it's okay for them to make every city look just like portland which is a disaster
 and again we could clean it up
 we just go right through it
 5000 10000 right through it
 these guys are tough
 they're smart
 and they love our country
 they love our country
 we'll clean it up in one half hour
 it'll be over
  strength
 they don't understand
 nice
 they chased him out of his home
 unbelievable
 biden's plan is to appease the domestic terrorist
 and my plan is to arrest them and prosecute them
 and i will always defend law abiding citizens
 that's why the rioters are voting for biden and the law enforcement people you know we have it from everybody
 we just got the sheriffs in florida all of them all of them
 we got ohio
 we got texas
 we got north carolina
 we got south carolina
 we got everybody
 i see rick perry right there
 rick perry what are you doing here rick
 rick perry one of the greats
 but they're all voting for me
 this election is about safety and this election is about jobs
 today i'm delighted to accept a very very special endorsement from people i like
 sort of grew up with these people
 i don't know what it is the relationship we have with all of us with all of us
 what i'm endorsing i'm getting an endorsement tonight from some very very special people
 they work hard
 they do great
 we really put them back to work because this state was in trouble
 at last year you had the single greatest economic year in the history of your whole operation right
 of your whole operation
 you've never had anything like that
 this has been your greatest
 this has been prior to the plague coming in
 it's been the commonwealth's greatest
 can we ever call the commonwealth a state
 you have two places
 but you always have to say well wait a minute
 is this one a commonwealth
 two places
 you know what the other place is
 name it
 huh
 that's right
 how did you know that congressmen
 huh
 but this commonwealth it's a great commonwealth
 it's a great place
 and the boilermakers local union it's local 154 of the boilermakers
 they chartered in pittsburgh 125 years ago
 none of you were around to see it and it now represents members in pennsylvania ohio and west virginia
 and i want to thank john hughes and the boilermakers here today
 it's a great honor to have you
 where's john
 where the hell is john
 stand up john
 john we appreciate it
 we appreciate it
 do you know why john is the head
 you know why
 because look he's got the worst location
 i say where's john
 i'm looking in the front row
 put up your hand john
 look at that guy
 he's great
 you've got my vote john
 hey boilermakers thank you
 what a job you do
 you're the heart of this country
 you really are
 thank you very much
 that's a great endorsement
 that's a great endorsement
 joe biden spent the last 47 years shipping pennsylvania jobs to china and foreign nations
 and i've spent the last four years bringing them back home and we're bringing them back home
 bringing a lot of things back home
 i ended the last administration's eight year pure war on pennsylvania oil and coal and fracking
 if you look at the natural gas what they've done to this state what they were doing to this state
 it was sort of easy
 i just opened it up and i said do it
 and the investment put into pennsylvania the investment put into the commonwealth of pennsylvania has been record setting
 but again you had the greatest year you've ever had last year prior to the virus
 you're going to be set
 now with what we're doing i believe that this next quarter which will be announced interestingly just prior to the election so i'm putting myself on the line but i know what's going to happen
 the numbers are going to be great
 and next year is going to be one of the greatest years not only for pennsylvania but for the entire country
 so joe hiden we have a new one joe hiden
 we call him joe hiden
 i have all
 what do you like better
 what do you like better
 we got a number
 let's do a little poll
 can we do a poll
 i saved myself so much money
 you know i saved myself so much money
 we do these polls with thousands and those people are coming in from the back are they not
 yes
 they're coming in
 i'm telling you wouldn't have believed it
 i'm landing
 i wasn't waving at you
 i was waving at them
 there's more
 but i do these polls
 right
 and it's like a perfect poll
 do you ever see the companies
 you give them a million bucks and they do a poll like 78 people were polled
 now you've got thousands of people
 so tell me
 what's your feeling first of all in the name you like maga make america great again
 yes
 oh you are the one
 you are a man
 i made you famous today
 you said the nicest things about me
 thank you
 did you see him on television today
 i think you're great
 i think you're great
 thank you
 no he called me a great christian and a great christian leader
 thank you
 but he did say i wasn't perfect but that's okay
 i said thank you anyway
 right
 no that was really great
 that was really great
 biden- no that was really great
 that was really great
 but if you look at it the things they've done we're going to go through a couple of different polls as we go along because i love the people saying do this or do that
 but one of the things i got you out of is this thing sounds so good but it's so bad
 it's a rip off of our country
 the so-called paris climate accord
 it's a disaster a death sentence
 it's a death sentence for your energy jobs
 i took it out
 i withdrew from that calamity
 biden pledged to reinstate it
 it's going to cost you billions and billions of dollars
 you know what it really is
 it's a way of really taking advantage of the united states
 this is what it is
 last year i visited the shell petrochemical plant in beaver county
 anybody ever hear of beaver county
 the largest investment in your state's history all made possible by our pro-energy policies
 biden would wipe out that entire industry killing the jobs of more than 600000 pennsylvania workers
 it's probably 940000 they say
 think of that
 also prices and everything else
 now biden today came out and said no no fracking's okay it's okay
 did you see that
 fracking's okay
 because he was getting killed
 and now we came out in favor of law enforcement
 look at all these handsome cops here
 and a beautiful cop
 if you would see how beautiful if you would see how beautiful this is it was like this perfect evening the sun was setting the faces of these great great majestic heroes of our country right
 heroes of our country
 and they want to blow mount rushmore
 but how about this one
 the democrats yesterday came out with a plan
 did you see it
 now they're the dc democrats
 they want to change the name of the washington monument perhaps take it down
 thomas jefferson pretty good thomas jefferson right
 you could forget about ever hearing that name again
 abraham lincoln you could forget about it
 they want to take down all statues all monuments in washington
 we have some of your greatest people right here
 let me not even talk to the congressmen
 the heck with the congressman the boiler makers
 how do you like
 how do you like the idea of taking down our statues to our great george washington thomas jefferson abraham lincoln andrew jackson all of them
 i don't think the boiler makers
 you'll do a ring around washington right
 along with christopher columbus
 he's in big trouble i'll tell you
 except there was one there was a group of great italians in new york they tried to take down
 they tried to take down christopher columbus statue in new york
 you saw what happened right
 these italians formed a little circle
 they said come on
 the agitators decided to leave
 let's get out of here darling
 they protected christopher columbus
 the italians now the italians aren't big on taking down christopher columbus
 you take down those statues you can forget about the italian vote
 do we agree
 but they protected it
 when asked at the debate if there would be any place for fossil fuels including coal and fracking and natural gas and so many things that really fire up these big plants where many of you work and they produce just millions and millions of jobs throughout our country biden said no we would absolutely not allow anything like that
 we would make sure it's totally eliminated
 that's what he said
 he said we would make sure it's totally eliminated or eliminated
 now he's coming and saying this isn't working too well
 this isn't working
 and i made a speech a week ago in texas
 we had crowds that were unbelievable on the highways you can't get in but the highways it's like incredible
 you could sell your ticket tonight for a lot of money go to ebay
 even as a used ticket you could probably sell
 but you go down the highways and you see it and i was thinking of texas i'm making a speech in front of obviously people that like oil they like god and you know what else they like they like their second amendment right
 so think about it
 so whether it's pennsylvania or texas or oklahoma or north dakota or any place you take a look at this right
 and no oil no guns no god
 i don't think george washington running with abraham lincoln as his vp he'll pick abraham lincoln as vp is going to win in texas or in pennsylvania or any place else with those three things eliminated
 that's what they want to do
 they want to take away your second amendment
 if i weren't president you would either have an obliterated second amendment or it would be gone entirely
 i am standing between them and your second amendment
 and that's it
 that's it
 they know
 we put baido in charge of guns
 baido is in charge he wants to get rid of everything
 baido that's a beauty
 remember he said i was born for this
 anybody that says they're born for this
 remember baido
 he was on the cover of a magazine i won't mention the magazine they're back there
 it's a total phony magazine
 but he was on the cover of the magazine
 and he said i was born to run for president
 he was born for it
 i was born
 anybody that gets that character
 that was when he was doing well
 since then he's cratered
 ever since he made that statement he's looked very bad
 but take a look at what he says about guns and he got put in charge of guns
 so i guess biden pretty soon he's going to be coming out saying no no
 i never said that
 check out all of the statements he's made on everything and now he's going the opposite way but he's agreed to the manifesto entirely so maybe he'll do that
 and then he figures later on he'll go
 but everything he said is right because he has no control over what's happening
 the radical left has captured the party
 they even elected a person that nobody ever heard of a senator it's been a while against a young good looking kennedy by 10 points in massachusetts
 did you know kennedy lost in massachusetts
 you know why
 because he wasn't a radical left
 he was like a semi-normal person just slightly left
 no but think of it
 this is what's happened
 and this is really what's happened
 if you're not a radical lefty meaning guns meaning fossil fuels they want wind wind
 to make the windmill which are made mostly in china and in germany by the way to make it so much emission is let out that is more than you can ever save
 it's just the craziest thing
 also i am truly an environmentalist but you have to understand
 when we do things and they don't and we clean and it's very expensive to do that and they don't and we have this massive planet and china india russia germany all these places it's fuming up and we're doing our job and beautiful
 no they have to do it also
 otherwise it just doesn't work the way it's supposed to
 they want to ban straws
 has anybody ever tried those paper straws
 they are not working too good
 right
 they want to ban straws i said well i've had a couple of meals at mcdonald's et cetera over the years right
 wendy's a friend of mine owns wendy's i'll give it a plug right
 burger king
 so they want to ban straws
 i said oh really
 what about the carton
 what about the plate
 what about the knives and the spoons that are plastic
 oh they're okay but the straws we got ban
 has anybody ever tried seriously the new straw it's made out of paper right
 it disintegrates as you drink and if you have a nice tie like this tie this would have no chance
 by the time you get finished the straw is totally disintegrated
 does anybody walk around with a plastic straw
 because it's that bad
 you whip it out boom boom
 you never had to do that
 when asked whether he would be willing to destroy the jobs of hundreds of thousands of blue collar workers to push his anti-energy agenda you know what the answer is right
 it's the green new deal right
 this green new deal
 this was made up by people that don't get it
 either that or people that just don't like our country very much
 but biden replied yes he'll get rid of those jobs
 and he famously told a voter i want you to look in my eyes when he's not wearing the mask because i've never seen a man that liked their mask
 look i'm all for it we have a big weekend distance on the weekend and all of that stuff and wear your mask when you're close together in particular and wash your hands all those things
 we have labor day weekend coming up
 but did you ever see a man that likes a mask as much as him
 and then he makes a speech and he always has it not always but a lot of times he has it hanging down
 because you know what
 it gives him a feeling of security
 if i were a psychiatrist right
 i'd say this guy's got some big issues
 hanging down
 hanging down
 congressman give me your mask
 i want to have it hanging from my ear
 i don't want to touch your damn mask
 mike i'll never touch your mask
 no but the new one is i went for a physical the doctor said to me sir would you like to go over to walter reed
 it's incredible
 by the way the job they do on people that have been just really hurt our heroes
 the job they do is incredible
 sir would you like to go over and do a physical
 you have some time
 you know why i had time
 some deal oh it was china
 i decided not to see china because i didn't like the way they were doing business okay
 does that make sense
 so the doctor white house doctor highly respected sean sean conley sir would you like to go over and do your physical or do a piece of it or finish it
 or whatever it was but do a physic
 i said i don't know
 i'm not in love with the idea
 well if you do it you don't have to do… okay
 let's go
 come on
 so we went we went and we're driving
 now you have to understand they're like a hundred cars
 you see what happens here
 it's like the plane times 50
 so the cars are driving all over to about a 20 minute drive and we get to the hospital i get out
 i was there probably for an hour and a half two hours
 and then yesterday i read that i had strokes
 cnn fake news cnn right there
 no it's true
 mini strokes they called them
 i don't know what a mini stroke is but it's not good
 and there could be a day and i'll admit i said hey it happens all of us
 right
 except these young ones
 it's never going to happen to them
 and i'd look at it at that but you know what happens
 but nothing happened
 so i went in i did that part of the physical
 the end result was he's very healthy
 they were very unhappy when they heard that result
 what you don't remember is when this took place it was a long time ago
 they just started up because they want to try and get me to be in biden's physical level
 they view me as being somebody that's i go around hey last week this week texas north carolina florida south carolina back to washington
 let's go here let's go there let's go everywhere
 meetings all the time
 i think i've answered more questions from these maniacs than any president in history
 and mean questions
 i watched biden yesterday so he hasn't answered questions in what two months or something
 and yesterday he took a couple and they were set ups like i've never seen
 one young woman who i think is there one young woman is smiling hi hi hi hi
 i just like to ask you i'm sorry to bother you with this question
 it's the most incredible
 so the doctor wrote a letter saying no this rumor is wrong
 and i don't like rumors like that
 and by the way if it were a fact it's fine it should
 i think it's an important thing
 but if it's not true my wife was like she came to me she said i think i would have known that
 i said yeah i think they would have known it too because they drove back with me
 the press follows me they have a special deal and then they followed me and then we go in we go out
 but if you remember last time i go in i spend a little time a physical like we all have
 hopefully you have them
 good thing to have i guess as long as they give you a good answer
 if they give you a bad answer don't bother possibly too late
 but i go in i come out a couple of hours later i guess whatever it is it's a short time later i get into the car the press sees me get into the car
 on my way home i get a call from my wife the first lady who's very popular
 do we like our first lady
 very popular great person great woman
 she said darling are you okay
 i go why do you ask
 she said they're reporting that you had a heart attack
 now you have to understand i'm driving in a car which is about what
 six cars in front of the press because they have a big car
 they're a lot of them and we try and give them as little room as possible make it uncomfortable
 but they're right behind me
 so they know i got in and cnn reported that i had a heart attack
 that was the same visit and that didn't work
 no it's unbelievable
 cnn reported i had a heart attack so my wife was concerned
 i said no not that i know of
 and if i did i think i'd be back there
 no
 i'll be home in 15 minutes darling
 thank you for caring
 it's always nice
 it's always nice
 she sounded relieved
 that's good
 when your wife sounds relieved
 but she said  i wonder how that happened
 why did they do that
 because they're fake news
 so i go in and that rumor lasted for a little while like a day or two
 it lasted for a little while no matter what i did
 i'm in the same motorcade i go in and i go out
 they know i'm in the motorcade i actually have to report it but i'm in the motorcade and they said i had a… one of them said it was a massive heart attack
 think of it
 again it could happen someday okay
 and when it does i hope things work out
 but they knew i'm in the motorcade and yet they reported it anyway because they fake news
 now for the same visit that was the stupidest thing
 from now on when i go for a physical or something or go to the hospital announce it because this was a quick thing
 the doctor he got me in a lot of trouble
 he's a great doctor
 i said no more surprise visits to the hospital where we do a little work because we have some time
 so now the same visit they started yesterday because some joker from the new york times who's a third grade reporter writes a book and he said the vice president was prepared to take over the reins because they thought the president was going to go i guess under anesthesia
 do they still call it…
 in the old days they called it anesthesia
 it's essentially the same thing
 i don't want to get into a situation like where biden used a record player
 remember that
 you go home you turn on your record player
 but the anesthesia
 and i said how could that be
 so remember this is the same visit same visit
 they said heart attack a long time
 all of a sudden out of this book
 and he said suffered mini strokes
 now they get a letter from the white house doctor that said it's totally false totally false
 but they still go with it they go with it
 and they know i'm in the group with them coming back
 and i don't know much about a mini stroke but i assume mr
 congressman if you have a mini stroke you're not heading back to the white house right
 at least you'll spend a couple of nights at that great hospital right
 so anyway these are really dangerous people
 they are so bad for our country
 if we had honest press it would be so great for the usa
 it would be so great
 they're just a bunch of phony people
 not all of them
 you have some very good ones like about 10
 no you have some very good ones you have some great journalists they know it's phony stuff
 they're doing anything they can to get this sleepy guy into the white house and i just don't think the public is going to fall for it
 i don't think the public is going to fall for it
 in his best days 25 30 years ago he was weak
 he was weak
 as a senator he was weak
 he was not known as being one of the smart ones and now it's not exactly primetime i can tell you that
 i just want to announce tonight because we're joined with some very very special warriors and dan meuser dan thank you very much
 great job you're doing
 dan congressman
 he's a congressman who have really been warriors for me
 you really have been
 thank you very much dan
 fred keller fred thank you
 great job fred

 glenn thompson
 great job great job glenn really great
 and a real good friend of mine right from the beginning right mike
 we were in pennsylvania and a friend of ours a congressman longterm right
 from kentucky
 no from actually tennessee came up to us i was getting ready to make a speech and tennessee is very early voting
 remember what he said
 this was four years ago
 he said i don't know what's happening in pennsylvania
 i don't know what's happening in the rest of the country
 but if what's going on in the rest of the country is like what's going on in tennessee
 he said they're coming from the hills the roadsides the rivers
 he said they're coming people that never really cared to vote they're great americans but they never wanted to vote for the people that they were seeing
 he said they're miles long
 they've got trump here trump hats trump pins right
 tennessee
 duncan congressman duncan right
 remember that mike
 that was the first time
 i mean they said that they'd never seen anything like it
 tennessee has been incredible by the way
 so mike and i listened and we said i wonder what that's all about
 but it is true
 people that weren't really political people they're coming in and the deal here like the miss universe good old miss universe right
 like this they came with hats they came with pins they're loaded with pins
 one person had hundreds of pins
 they never would've had a pin in their life but they love the job that we've done and we're going to do it even better in the next four years
 another great friend of mine who's a tough cookie and a great congressman
 but unfortunately he's a former because he's just i don't know
 he's just a special guy and really has a big beautiful heart lou barletta lou
 you look good lou
 why don't you run again lou
 and a man who is tough
 there's this guy
 you ever hear of a guy named conor lamb
 he's like a lamb
 so we heard because he's in sort of a trumpy area right
 and we heard that he's going to be for trump but he's going to be fighting for trump
 i saw some of his commercials i thought he was a republican right
 except when he got to washington he voted with pelosi a hundred percent of the time
 craziness
 he voted with craziness
 and so we thought this conor lamb guy he even voted to impeach your president over nothing
 zero
 zero
 and that's very personal
 when they do that that's personal
 and i have to say congressmen 196 to nothing they stuck with us and so did the senate other than romney
 you can have romney i think
 remember he was walking with the black lives matter saying yes i'm a member of black lives matter
 everyone said that's nice
 wonderful
 he had a lot of mask on i'll tell you that
 but we did a great job it was an amazing thing
 but this conor lamb was out there fighting it and he shouldn't have done that
 and we have somebody that blows him away
 he's more of a hero he's tougher he's stronger he's smarter he's better looking not that that matters
 under the me too generation i don't talk about looks anymore
 looks don't matter
 doesn't make any difference
 i don't talk about looks
 me too
 me too generation
 but i'll tell you this man is something special
 he's a real hero a real tough guy and he'll never let you down sean parnell
 just remember that conor lamb and i remember because he's like a lamb he's like a little lamb
 weak got a lot of weak people
 we like strong people don't we
 we like strong people
 we need strong people right now
 we have somebody else in the audience who served as my secretary of energy and he was incredible
 he was the governor of texas for what
 12 years i think
 rick right
 12
 tell me
 14
 14 years he was
 and he was an incredible governor and he was an incredible secretary and he's been an incredible friend
 rick perry everybody
 there was nobody that got into the race tougher than rick
 what he said about me i'll never repeat again
 even my own family didn't like me when he got finished
 and when he decided that i would be the one he got out and there's nobody that's said better things about me
 but you're great rick and you did a fantastic job
 every place you've been you've been great
 thank you very much
 rick perry
 thank you
 hey rick how are we doing in texas
 00 the polls closed and they only announce if you're way ahead
 so they say the polls have closed in the great state of texas donald trump has won the great state of texas
 … hillary even beat this guy
 hillary
 hillary came in second in utah
 this week my administration reached a breakthrough agreement to stop additional steel imports from brazil and from mexico for the rest of the year despite the usmca sometimes they get a little carried away and we have to do a little tariff action on them
 so we stopped that
 we're reversing decades of the biden betrayals that decimated pennsylvania jobs you know that
 this state lost listen to this one in three manufacturing jobs after the twin disasters of nafta and china's entrance into the world trade organizations one of the worst things that happened when china came in
 they were flat-lined for many years then they came into this crazy deal
 they're considered a developing nation you see i've been sort of protesting that like but they're considering china as a developing nation you get all sorts of things that you would never get advantages over the united states
 well we have very strongly protested that
 they're not a developing nation they're a very powerful developed nation and you know what
 they got to pay what everyone else has to pay
 earlier this year i kept my promise to the commonwealth of pennsylvania when we ended the nafta nightmare and signed the brand new u
s
-mexico-canada agreement into law which is in effect now and really doing well
 everyone said it will never happen and i had great help from these gentlemen right here
 i took the toughest ever action to stand up to china's pillaging plundering and rampant theft of pennsylvania and many other places jobs
 that's all throughout the world by the way but our states have been just pillaged by china and others
 joe biden's agenda is made in china my agenda is made in america
 after years and years of rebuilding other countries we are finally rebuilding our country it's called america first
 we're america first that's enough and we're bringing our soldiers back home
 you see what's going on
 after 19 years in afghanistan far away places to bring hope to our inner cities i created opportunity zones tim scott great senator from south carolina worked on it with me
 passed criminal justice reform delivered permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities that obama would never do and before the china virus we achieved the lowest african-american hispanic-american asian-american unemployment rates ever recorded by far
 and they're now heading back in that direction quickly
 democrat politicians have failed the black community for decades they've failed the asian community the hispanic community
 they failed women
 the numbers on women's unemployment were the best in 61 years
 biden spent the last 47 years betraying the american people
 he was always for things that you wouldn't want and now he's changing no i never said that
 i never said that
 i've spent the last four years keeping my promises and delivering for the african-american community and for all communities and the best is yet to come
 perhaps in no area have our opponents more thoroughly betrayed working families of all backgrounds and on the subject of immigration we've been fighting for that
 under my administration we achieved the most secure border in american history
 we ended catch and release stopped asylum fraud and we've deported 20000 gang members and we get them out and we get them out fast
 thank you ice
 ice and border patrol
 ice and border patrol
 they don't like ice because ice is they're tough
 you got to be tough in that job by the way
 anybody up here like to work in ice
 i don't think so
 let's see you could probably be okay but you'd rather do what you're doing right
 i agree with you
 these are tough guys they have to be tough
 these are bad bad gang members
 i mean you look at ms-13 you look at what's happened with ms-13 you look at … we get them the hell out
 sometimes we have to put them in prison because we don't even want to take a chance they can come back in after what they've done we had thieves we had some very bad people in the va and they're all gone
 thank you i love you too thank you
 thank you
 such friendly voices
 quite beautiful
 only in pennsylvania right
 thank you
 i withdrew from the last administration's disastrous iran nuclear deal think of this
 obama paid 150 billion for a short-term deal
 he gave 1
8 billion in cash
 you ever see a million dollars like at a casino floor or something in 100 bills
 it's a lot it's like the size of this right
 now think 1
8 billion
 how did you guys allow that to happen
 they said we all voted against it
 i kept my promise recognized the true capital of israel
 you never know nowadays right
 and i opened the u
s
 embassy in jerusalem
 i recognized israeli sovereignty over the golan heights
 they've been trying to get that done for 52 years i got it done immediately
 by the way as far as the capital of israel jerusalem they've been talking about many many presidents
 they all promised it nobody did it
 i did it
 we get things done and we just did something that is incredible
 even the new york times gave it good reviews not good reviews beyond good reviews
 tom friedman gave it phenomenal reviews you believe that
 that's we achieved the first breakthrough in middle east peace in decades a deal with israel and the uae
 it's a deal with israel and the uae and that's going to lead and i'm going to tell you we have representatives over right now and other people are saying we want to get in that deal
 you'll have peace in the middle east
 we want to get the hell out
 let's get them all back
 let's get thel all back
 don't forget we're energy independent
 there used to be a reason
 now we do have a reason it's called israel and we have some very good partnerships over there
 in all fairness we have some countries that have treated us very well and we're going to take care of those countries but we are energy independent for the first time and that's a very good feeling
 our military has never been stronger than it is now
 it's new and it's beautiful and i told you we took over 100 of the isis caliphate in iraq and syria and we killed the founder and leader of isis al-baghdadi and separately we killed the world's number one terrorist number one terrorist for decades and decades qasem soleimani
 we killed soleimani
 it's a big step for the middle east
 we kept america out of wars
 remember they always said oh this trump
 he's radical he's really i mean he's off the … he's too radical
 he'll get us in wars
 i kept us out of wars what happened with north korea
 look i get along with kim jong-un
 they say that's terrible he gets along
 no it's good if i get along
 if i get along with russia is that a good thing or a bad thing
 i think it's a good thing
 these guys only fight to tie they don't fight to win you fight to win
 you look at what's happening where they're all coming back home
 i even reduced in germany because germany they're an ally but you know they took advantage of us very badly on trade and very badly with our military
 so we removed a lot of soldiers out of germany
 they're not happy they said this is going to hurt our economy
 well it's good for our economy okay
 they thought it was going to hurt the german economy
 well they don't treat us right they don't pay their bills they're delinquent
 you know what delinquent is
 they're delinquent
 they don't pay their bills
 we protect them they don't pay their bills
 we got to do something and they treat us horribly on trade through the european union which basically they run
 together we've been rapidly fixing a half a century of disasters and biden was there for every one of them
 joe biden supported nafta china's entry into the world trade
 he supported the korean deal the korean deal was so bad it was so bad
 this was a deal that was going to produce to south korea done by crooked hillary clinton this was a deal that was going to produce 250000 jobs
 she said  this will be 250000 and she was right for south korea
 it produced 250000 jobs
 for us we got nothing
 we got losses we got nothing
 it was a terrible deal i renegotiated now it's a good deal
 they also gave and want to give mass amnesty for illegal aliens
 biden supported cutting social security
 he voted for the iraq war he opposed the mission to take out osama bin laden
 he opposed the killing of soleimani when i did that he said that's a terrible thing
 that's a terrible thing
 everybody in the middle east they couldn't believe it
 they celebrated some of them quite quietly i must add
 sign your mail-in ballot
 you sign it and send it in and then you have to follow it and if on election day or early voting that is not tabulated and counted you go vote and then if for some reason after that it shouldn't take that long it comes in they're not going to be able to tabulate it because you will have voted
 but you have to make sure your vote counts because the only way they're going to beat us is by doing that kind of stuff
 i'm trying to be nice
 i'm trying to be nice
 they want to send out congressmen 80 million ballots
 now there have been many races over the last year where they've done this and they've been a disaster
 you look at new york they had a congressional race not a very good congresswoman very untalented i know her well i lived in new york
 she's not got much going
 they have no idea what the vote is i think 20 of the ballots were missing and then they declared her the winner and the other guy said what about me
 he's not too happy her opponent
 you look at what happened in paterson new jersey you look at what happened in virginia you look at what happened … there's not a race and these are small these are easy to control
 they want to send out 80 million unsolicited i like it much better they used to say universal they used to say live ballots i like the word unsolicited and solicited
 solicited is okay because that's when you're asking and you want it and you send in the necessary paperwork and documentation and you get the ballot and you fill it out that's okay
 but you can't this whole thing with the unsolicited unsolicited means you're sitting there
 we have a big enthusiasm edge but when they throw these things in your face and the lists are inaccurate and people are dead and dogs have gotten ballots they have
 dogs have gotten ballots and they know i'm right and everybody knows i'm right and they say i'm right behind the closed doors and it's a disgrace what they do to our country
 80 million unsolicited ballots
 people that had no idea
 people that weren't going to vote in all fairness
 it's really unfair because our people have enthusiasm they're going out to vote
 they're all going out to vote
 everybody here going to vote
 everybody
 they have no enthusiasm
 so i said so that's unfair
 that guy walks and then they'll have somebody knock on the door say listen i would like your ballot
 i don't want to vote
 i don't care about biden
 i'm a democrat
 i don't care about this guy
 well look where is it
 here take it blah blah blah
 they even have a provision where you don't have to verify signatures
 what is going on
 and they have another provision in some states where you can harvest that's where you grab them all together and drop them
 in nevada they actually have a provision where they don't have to be counted until seven days after the election
 so that means if we have a close election could be close i hope it's not i hope we have a landslide like you've never seen
 but if we have a close election that means nevada has the right to and i love nevada i think we're going to win nevada except where they're sending all these hundreds of thousands millions of unsolicited ballots to people in nevada and people that probably left a long time ago
 it's very unfair it's very unfair but think of it
 they have seven days after the election
 did you know that mike
 seven days what does that mean
 i want to see the results of the election on november 3
 by the way if it's anything like these other events it could go on forever
 i mean the congressional race which they just gave up and they declared her a winner which they should not have done they should make that a do-over and i think in paterson they have a do-over
 i think they're going to do it over because it was just ripe with fraud theft
 people were selling ballots people were selling ballots and you know they talk about russia
 they're so worried about russia
 what about sending out 80 million ballots
 that's your real problem and if russia or china or these other countries want to cheat all they have to do is forge ballots
 it's much easier than the way they have to go about it right
 so we have to put pressure on these people
 now the good news is we have a lot of court cases we have won in pennsylvania you know that right
 we have two judges we have a state judge we have a federal judge
 i think both highly qualified judges from what i understand i hear that they're not too happy about what they're seeing
 so we'll see what happens
 we're going to see what happens
 the lawyers feel very confident but we have to win those cases but what you have to do is send in your early ballot and then go and make sure that ballot is tabulated or counted and if it's not counted vote and then they have the job if it comes in late and if it's not too late they have the job of making sure that they don't count it
 but follow that ballot because these people they'll be lost they'll be gone the numbers are incredible where they're 25 and 30 off 20 off
 follow your ballot
 when i banned travel from china biden called it hysterical and xenophobic
 if we had listened to sleepy joe hundreds of thousands of more americans would have died
 you know that
 you know he always gets up today covid-19 covid-19
 i say joe look
 we got a country and i agree with that and we've done a hell of a job
 we've done a hell of a job
 if you look at some of our numbers
 you got to start talking about the economy and you got to start talking your place i mean this is … when you look at pennsylvania you're in a shutdown
 you have a governor that has you shut down we know the susceptible are old people senior citizens nursing homes
 people that are old especially if they have heart problems or if they have diabetes
 we know that we learned it and we opened it up
 but the problem these shutdowns are causing much bigger problems
 you remember my original statement right
 the cure can't be greater
 it was an original statement that a lot of people picked up but it's so true
 you have to open up this commonwealth it has to be opened up
 it has to be opened up now
 but there's what i think they're doing because you have the same thing in new york
 we have a governor in new york who is 36000 people died 11000 people in a nursing home because he made a mistake
 he made a horrible mistake and i built him a convention center with 2800 beds and they didn't use it and i sent up a ship a great hospital ship a massive hospital with hundreds and hundreds of rooms and they didn't use it and he requested it and then i said you're not using it
 why aren't you using it
 he could have put those people in the convention center in the hospital ship
 what a shame how long can you do this for
 restaurant poor guys
 you can't how long can you do this for
 the people are going to lose their jobs
 they're never going to open again
 it's not like the restaurants is the greatest business in the world
 it's a hard business
 new york is closed
 you're closed
 north carolina's closed
 michigan's … all democrats
 let me tell you what's going to happen on november 4th
 they're going to announce their opening
 they're doing this for political reasons
 they are
 right john
 they're doing it for political reasons because they want our numbers to look as bad as possible going into november 3rd election day
 then as soon as the election's over with win lose or draw for them they're going to open it
 they got nothing
 you know what
 it's a shame what they're doing
 for political reasons they'll be open
 you'll be open on november 4th but you know what
 from your standpoint it's very close to the election
 it's very far if you have a restaurant and you can't open your restaurant
 you can't open your store
 it's a disgrace and they ought to get together
 they ought to do it
 these are democrat governors in all instances and democrat mayors
 when the china virus arrived we launched the largest national mobilization since world war ii
 thanks to the life- saving therapies that we pioneered the mortality rate has been reduced by 85 since april
 think of that
 we've achieved among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country anywhere in the world
 you never hear that from the fake news
 they don't want to talk to you about it
 this is a big country
 this is a tougher country to do that with the european union's case fatality rate is nearly three times higher than ours
 if you look now spain is having a big blow up
 france is having a big blow up
 now we've done a great job we haven't been given credit for it
 he always starts off covid-19
 that's all he knows
 covid-19
 i said what about the economy
 what about jobs
 what about all the other things we have to do
 all he does he thinks it's a weak spot and actually in theory if we're getting a fair shake from those people back there it's actually what the job we've done is actually a strong spot
 that includes you people with the ventilators that nobody had
 nobody that needed a ventilator didn't get a ventilator
 now we're supplying them all over the world
 altogether the nations of europe have experienced a 30 greater increase in excess mortality than the united states
 think of that
 you don't hear these numbers
 cases in the us have declined by 28 nationwide over the last month and hospitalizations and deaths have declined radically over the last week
 three vaccines are in final stage of clinical trials
 would have taken two years for another president
 i was going to say a normal president but they'll hit me with … a little truth to that too
 now but for another president especially in the last administration they had the h1n1 pandemic
 it was called swine flu
 you know joe always calls it the n1h1
 he gets it mixed up
 no it's the h1n1 joee
 not that it matters i guess
 no
 do you ever notice he's always calling it the other
 he calls it the opposite
 he has no clue where he is but he keeps saying oh if he was well he didn't want the ban china and we saved hundreds of thousands of lives by banning china
 i was the only one that wanted to do it actually
 then we banned europe because i saw what was happening in italy and spain and france
 we banned europe
 we saved hundreds of thousands
 if i didn't do the closing and the opening so we're at 175000 far too … look one is too much because this was given to us by china and it's a disgrace
 it's a disgrace
 they could have stopped it
 they stopped it from going into china but not going to the rest of the world including our country
 it's a disgrace
 but think of it
 joe biden got the worst marks you've ever seen for his handling of the h1ni swine flu
 they said it was incompetent and the head guy who now he's trying to retract
 it's a little tough
 that's one great thing about the tape
 he said it was horrible
 he said we did a horrible job
 he said they got lucky
 it's not contagious like this
 we got this is a tough one
 i can look at that guy and he'll catch it
 right there and he's very far away from me
 it's a tough one because it's so contagious
 i tell you what our vice-president mike pence and the task force headed up by mike and working along with a lot of great people they've done a fantastic job and they just get no credit
 if i was a democrat a different president and they did the same job they'd say it was one of the greatest jobs they've ever seen
 but take a look at what they say about the way they handled the swine flu
 it was a disaster
 it was incompetent
 they called themselves incompetent
 they call and now they're coming in like well we would have done this and biden by the way was against you remember xenophobic racist because i closed down china
 then two months later two and a half three and nancy pelosi was having dances in chinatown right
 a month later
 no no problem
 i was way ahead
 then biden comes out and he actually said that i was right but they said don't say that try doing it a little softer than that
 he did it a little bit softer but we were right
 they were wrong
 they handled it so badly
 just take a look because we i said to my people we've got to fight this a little bit differently because we're getting a lot of fake news a lot of bad people saying things and you look at the stats and you look at how we've done compared to really much easier and much smaller countries it's amazing
 if you took new york out of it which was a disaster by cuomo if you took new york out of those numbers we would have numbers that would be even better than they are
 i could read numbers that would be even much better because a big percentage of the people that died in this country died because new york was incompetently run by mayor de blasio and governor cuomo
 by the way just today there's another credible thing happening
 pfizer great company announced that it expects to have the results of its vaccine trials in a matter of weeks very shortly
 incredible
 under operation warp speed we remain on track to produce a safe and effective vaccine in that record time that we talked about
 this would have been years later
 it'll be delivered before in my opinion before the end of the year but it really might even be delivered before the end of october
 how do you like that
 wouldn't that be nice
 that would be nice
 you know why
 not because of the electric
 it'll be nice because we want to save people
 that's why it'll be nice
 that's the important thing
 together we will defeat the virus
 the job we're doing is the job that all of the people working on it our generals our admirals the distribution we bought billions and billions of dollars of things and now we make gowns and we make masks and we make shields and we make ventilators
 very tough
 the ventilator's very complicated very big very expensive
 it's like i made the statement it's like building a car but more sophisticated
 they said no it's not
 they said they took a ventilator
 they took it apart
 these people are the worst the worst
 over the next four years we'll make america into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we will end our reliance on china once and for all
 that's what we'll do
 let me just tell you something
 if they didn't waste a year and a half of my life on a ridiculous impeachment based on a phone call that was perfect this stuff would have all been done
 would have all been done truly
 it would have all been done
 yet with all of this stuff the fake russia witch hunt the fake ukraine
 how about that
 did anybody read the transcript of that call
 it was a perfect call
 hey congratulations
 good luck
 it was like a perfect call
 now they'll take it back and they'll say well i don't know
 this was a per … in history there's never been anything like this
 it was a totally lopsided 100 political witch hunt and it goes on and on
 these are bad people
 i really believe they don't love our country
 i watched nancy pelosi
 you must wear your mask
 you have to wear your mask and we're going to keep every beauty salon closed in california and all over the country
 then i see a picture
 i say nancy pelosi
 well where's the mask
 i'll tell you what
 she must have treated that beauty salon owner pretty badly
 she uses the salon and the salon turned her in
 the salon turned her in
 i don't think i would have turned her in
 i would've said well you know she's a customer
 i got to take care of my customers right
 but she made them open and the salon turned her in and the salon did business with her
 how much do they hate nancy pelosi
 then she made a terrible mistake because you want people that can't be set up
 she said i was set up
 i was set up by the salon owner
 i was set up
 i said tell me she didn't say that please
 i just put out that if she was set up then she shouldn't be leading the house of representatives
 i want the salon owner to lead the house of representatives because she set up … think of it
 she set up the speaker of the house
 that was a big mistake
 as soon as i heard she said well she's sent me up nancy you're not supposed to get set up
 you're representing our country
 you know what she should have done honestly
 she should have said i made a mistake sorry and nobody would be talking about this is like the biggest story
 this is the big crazy nancy highly overrated person
 let me just say she is a highly overrated person
 they give her such good play
 she is a highly overrated person
 look they just turned off a camera because they don't want me saying that
 just in closing we will rapidly return to full employment soaring wages and record prosperity
 we will hire more police increased penalties for assault on law enforcement
 surge federal prosecutors into high-crime communities and ban sanctuary cities
 we will appoint prosecutors judges and justices who believe in enforcing the law not their own political agenda
 we will uphold religious liberty free speech and the right to keep and bear arms
 we will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens
 we will not let them threaten our citizens and we will keep america out of endless foreign wars
 we will end surprise medical billing
 we don't want surprise medical billing
 you know what happens
 it's terrible but we have ended it
 also we've signed something that's incredible
 you're going to see
 some people say it's bigger than healthcare and i signed it
 unfortunately it takes place on january 1st
 you better elect me
 you better elect me
 it's called price transparency
 i said to my people at the end of the day what is price transparency
 this is going to lower your prices by 50
 you'll be able to negotiate
 you'll be able to do things you're not even allowed to do now with hospitals with doctors
 you get better doctors you get lower prices
 i said when does it start
 it's a complicated … oh did i get i was fought
 you have no idea
 right fellows
 you have fought too
 but they fought me on this price transparency
 it's bigger than healthcare could be bigger than healthcare
 but i said when does it start
 they said sir we have it all set
 when
 january 1st i said i'd better win this election because you're going to see some unbelievable price reductions
 that includes on drugs because we're reducing health insurance premiums massively and the cost of prescription drugs went down the first time in 51 years last year
 but now it's going to go down very big because we did a favorite nation's clause
 i see the drug companies are they're killing me with ads
 they have nothing but cash
 they have nothing but money
 they're spending because they can't believe … germany and other countries pay much less than we do
 we want to have what we have to have is we have to have a comparison of prices
 that's what it is called favored nation clause
 i instituted a favorite so we're paying 2
50 for a pill and some nation is paying 25 cents for the same exact pill from the same factory right
 we get the 25 cent price
 so what's going to happen that'll go up
 ours will come way down
 they can't believe it
 the drug companies can't believe and i will tell you mark meadows is here our chief of staff
 where's mark
 they want to negotiate
 they called
 we signed it
 it's all done
 they want to negotiate and they are negotiating so let's see what happens but we're going to get you cuts on prescription drugs the likes of which you've never seen
 we'll protect medicare and social security
 they will not be able to protect it
 it will always protect patients with preexisting conditions always
 america will land the first woman on the moon and the united states will be the first nation to land an astronaut on mars
 when i took over nasa was dead
