 thank you very much everybody
 thank you
 wow
 i will never ever let you down that i can tell you
 amazing
 and i want to thank manchester and new hampshire they're very special
 you remember those primaries
 that primary came around and remember what happened during the primary
 trump should come in third or fourth and we came in easily number one and that was the beginning
 that was an easy one
 i want to thank you all
 this is incredible and it's great to be back in a state that i love with thousands of hardworking patriots who are the heart and soul of america
 and that's what you are
 we're actually here today to officially launch our campaign to win the great state of new hampshire in 2020
 and i saw some fake polls put out by the fake news media and it said that i'm tied with three of the other candidates the democrats i'm tied in new hampshire
 i don't think so
 one of them has a rally he's got 100 people
 so this holds 12000 we're full
 and we could fill it up four times at least
 we could fill it up four times
 but i just want to thank you all
 i just think it's going to be a tremendous four years
 we're going to have a tremendous four years
 can you believe it
 we only have a little more than a year to go where it all started right
 the greatest political movement in the history of our country
 and even though we had fake witch hunts on our back and all the other things that we had to go through we have taken this big beautiful ship and it's being turned around very quickly
 three years ago we campaigned across the country on a pledge to make america great again
 and that's exactly what we've done
 i think we can honestly say it's the greatest slogan in the history of politics in america
 make america great again
 so if you don't mind the other candidates go they spend millions and millions of dollars on this question that i'm going to ask you
 they spend millions
 you remember the first slogan from our opponent
 that's right neither do i
 neither does anybody
 nobody remembers
 the only thing i remember is the first night i went out after i heard it and i said see it's all about her
 and they immediately changed it after spending like a million dollars
 it's all about her
 that didn't work out too well
 that slogan wasn't too good
 so we have to do this
 we have to make a decision
 do you give up the greatest slogan in the history of politics in our country
 make america great again right
 do we give up make america great again for a new slogan because look our country is doing great
 we are doing very well with china despite the fact that they want to have you believe in the contrary
 all you have to do is say china how you doing
 they're not too happy they're not too happy
 they're losing millions of jobs
 the tariffs are working and they're eating the tariffs by the way
 there's no price increase
 you know you gotta talk to these people
 the fake news
 but do we give up
 and by the way the biggest beneficiary you know who have been great
 our great farmers have been so incredible because they've been targeted by china and frankly they've been targeted for a long time including by incompetent politicians that have run this country for a long time
 so we're making up for a lot of lost ground
 but do we give up make america great for keep america great
 keep america great
 okay you ready
 ready
 i love this because it's free
 and we have all the time in the world right
 is there anything better than a trump rally
 what about a sleepy joe biden rally
 well he's made some beauties
 i sort of hope it's him
 i don't mind any of them
 you got pocahontas is rising
 we got kamala
 kamala is falling
 you got beto
 beto is like gone
 all right we'll see what happens
 whoever it is i don't know that it matters but whoever it is different different people
 but i don't know i think sleepy joe may be able to limp across the finish line
 but today they announced that they're going to cut way back on his appearances because he is such a disaster they're going to have fewer appearances
 you've heard that right
 they're going to cut way back on his appearances
 can you believe it
 if i ever did that it would be over
 the fake news would get us but we don't let them get us and it is fake
 and today the deputy editor of the new york times was demoted
 isn't that beautiful
 all the news that is not fit to print
 all the news the fake failing new york times
 it's really we it's not me
 we're doing it together
 they came from the hills they came from the mountains from the rivers they came from all over the place
 and they showed up and they voted like nobody's seen before
 and it was 306 to 223 remember
 306
 and we won wisconsin and they said oh we never thought of that
 got to think about those things
 and we won michigan
 and now we have a lot of car companies coming into michigan and we have a lot of great farming events happening really big in wisconsin
 and we have incredible things going on in pennsylvania
 we just opened up a 10 billion plant
 we have many of them going up
 many of them a lot of jobs
 in louisiana an lng plant 10 billion
 could never have happened could never have happened
 pennsylvania would have never happened
 they wouldn't have allowed him to frack
 so they would've never been able to build it
 but what a place that is it will be open in a little more than a year but i have to make a decision
 it's a big decision
 do we give up the greatest theme phrase logo whatever you want to call it in the history of politics risky for a brand new one because make america great again
 we're really sort of there and we have a little time left
 and now we have a group of socialists or communists could be
 they're not far away
 the fake news will hit me on that
 how dare he say that
 but they're not far away right
 they're not far away
 95
 does anybody want to pay 95 taxes
 i don't think so
 but i'm not going to go into their plan because as far as i'm concerned the green new deal is a beautiful thing
 no it's a beautiful thing
 we want it to continue onward until about a month before the election
 i will let them have it like you've never heard before
 i don't want it to change
 too early
 it's like elizabeth warren
 i did the pocahontas thing
 i hit her really hard and it looked like she was down and out but that was too long ago
 i should've waited
 but don't worry
 we will revive it
 it can be revived
 it can be rewritten right
 it will be revived and it can be revived very easily and very quickly
 and we're going to have some fun in the state of new hampshire
 now what do we do ready
 let me have first make america great again then keep america great right
 just applaud like crazy for the one you want to use for this campaign
 and there's a possibility we'll use both
 there's a possibility we'll use both 'cause i hate like hell to give up the one
 is it a possibility we'll use both
 maybe one a little bit less
 are you ready
 so we'll start make america great again and then keep america
 are you ready
 who's in favor of the campaign theme being make america great again
 who's in favor of our theme being keep america great
 oh wait a minute
 this is your hat
 i was going to keep it actually
 thank you
 so that's really been the reaction
 i've done this before
 big crowds and it really is keep america great because we have these socialists want to take it away from us
 they want to take it away
 because until a couple of days ago and that'll catch up very quickly we have no choice
 by the way i never said china was going to be easy but it's not tough and they want to make a deal
 we just spoke to them yesterday
 they want to make a deal
 they want to make a deal
 they have to make a deal
 and you know what
 it'd be wonderful to make a deal
 i don't think we're ready to make a deal
 we're taking in billions of dollars in tariffs
 and again china's devaluing their currency
 they're pouring out money the prices haven't gone up
 so that means we're taking in billions of dollars
 we're not paying for it
 and ultimately their devaluations are going to hurt them very badly
 they want to make a deal and they should want to make a deal
 but when you listen to the fake news look at how many there are
 i mean i actually had something today
 i had something today
 are we sure that we're in new hampshire
 you know you have a reputation
 i mean i know it's not true 'cause i know you too well
 you have a reputation of being very stayed very very elegant stayed incredible people
 you're not acting it tonight and that's good
 that's a good thing
 wow
 we love our country
 we have enthusiasm for our country
 that's what it is
 before the election our factories were closing
 hey who knows it better than you
 you're like central casting for the closing of factories
 our jobs were vanishing
 our military was totally depleted
 when i took over our military was sad
 we weren't flying half of our planes they were old
 they were tired
 our equipment was tired
 our people weren't tired though
 our people weren't tired
 but everything we had it was depleted
 now we've rebuilt our military like never before
 and all made in the usa just so you know
 and our nation was weakened at home and disrespected abroad
 they don't disrespect us anymore folks
 i got nato to pay an extra hundred billion dollars
 they weren't paying
 they were delinquent
 many nations were except for seven
 many nations weren't paying what they were supposed to be paying so we're supposed to protect them
 they kill us on trade
 they have all sorts of barriers and everything else
 the taxes are really unfair
 the tariffs were ridiculous what they do to us in europe
 and then we protect them
 then they don't pay and i say i'm sorry folks you have to pay
 you have to pay
 they were delinquent they were delinquent
 and my biggest fan is secretary general stoltenberg from nato
 he said until president trump came along we were going boom
 they would've been finished very quickly but i'm tired of paying for other nations anyway i have to be honest with you
 today our nation is stronger than ever before
 we're now stronger than ever before
 you saw we ended the iran disaster
 how about that
 we paid them a 150 billion
 1
8 billion in cash
 cash cash cash
 we got nothing
 and they also want to make a deal
 china wants to make a deal and i will tell you iran wants to make a deal because the sanctions are not good for them
 they are not happy
 so we'll see how it all turns out
 but it's in good hands
 it's in good hands
 the united states right now has the hottest economy anywhere in the world
 we're rebuilding that awesome might that we were just talking about
 our united states armed forces
 america is working again
 america is winning again and america is respected again respected like never before
 they respect us again and you see it
 you know a recent poll came out where it showed that president obama was more popular in germany and other places than i am
 and i said of course he's more popular
 he's not demanding that they pay for their protection that we provide
 he's not doing that
 i'm doing that
 and in fact if i was the most popular i'm not doing my job right
 so true
 we've created over six million new jobs since the election
 if i would have said that during the campaign those people back there would have been headlines headlines
 more than seven million americans have been lifted off of food stamps
 since my election the number of new businesses starting in the great state of new hampshire has skyrocketed by almost 25
 and you can't really go by my election
 you gotta go by november 9th because the markets have gone through the roof since november 9th
 that's the day after i won the election
 so i won the election
 the markets went up thousands of points
 things started happening
 you started doing things that you would've never
 even though i didn't get sworn in until january 20th but they refused to do that
 and let me tell you if for some reason i wouldn't have won the election these markets would have crashed
 that'll happen even more so in 2020
 see the bottom line is i know you like me and this room is a love fest i know that
 but you have no choice but to vote for me because your 401ks down the tubes
 everything's going to be down the tubes so whether you love me or hate me you got to vote for me
 i had a businessman the other day one of the most successful guys in the country
 i've never liked him never liked him
 he never liked me i never liked him
 i see him in the white house
 i said what are you doing here
 he said i'm working to make sure you get elected
 i said you've got to be kidding
 you don't like me
 i don't like you
 what the hell is this all about
 he said that's right
 we've had our differences
 i haven't liked you but to be honest with you mr
 president i have no choice
 i said you're right
 you're right
 first thing i've ever heard him say that i agreed with he's got no choice
 he got no choice
 unemployment in new hampshire has reached the lowest rate in actually 31 years
 but within a very short period of time it will be the lowest rate in the history of our country
 think of that
 you have the best unemployment you have the most successful state in the history of your state and in the history of our country
 and then you're going to vote for somebody else
 oh great
 let's vote for elizabeth pocahontas warren
 we have the best numbers we've ever had
 let's vote for somebody else
 i don't think that's going to happen folks
 i don't think that's going to happen
 only with fixed poles does that happen
 unemployment for african americans
 you've heard me say this many times and i'm very proud of it
 hispanic americans and asian americans have all reached their lowest rates ever recorded in the history of our county
 wages are rising quickly
 remember when i used to say people have been working two and three jobs making less money than they made 21 years ago
 i used to say it all the time
 now i can say for the first time in 20 years wages are rising and you know who's the biggest beneficiary
 blue collar workers
 my administration is fighting to expand opportunity for citizens of every background and every race religion color and creed
 very important
 because we are all americans
 we all share the same home
 we all share the same heart
 we all share the same dreams
 we are all children of the same almighty god
 but at the very moment when our country should be coming together to enjoy these wonderful blessings the radical democrats are trying to tear america apart
 they vilify anyone who doesn't share their extreme views
 they slander our law enforcement heroes
 you see what they're doing with our police that we love
 you see what they're doing
 has anyone ever seen anything like the water being thrown on new york's finest
 have you ever seen
 and i know a lot of new york's finest
 they're not happy they're not happy
 and they are great people
 these are great great proud people
 for that to be allowed to happen is a disgrace
 they view everybody as fascist and nazis
 they used the term nazi
 this was a term you couldn't even use it
 now they use it like on a regular basis
 nazi
 he's a nazi
 think of that
 he's a nazi
 you couldn't use it
 now they use it
 they accuse our heroic border agents of running concentration camps and they do an incredible job
 and the democrats don't want to fix the loopholes or asylum
 they do an incredible job our border agents
 and they looked down upon the hardworking citizens who truly make our country run
 but while the democrats rage and resist … that guy's got a serious weight problem
 go home start exercising
 get him out of here please
 you got a bigger problem than i do
 got a bigger problem than all of us
 now he goes home and his mom says what the hell have you just done
 we are continuing our incredible movement the greatest political movement in the history of our country
 there's never been a movement like this
 never
 our movement is built on love and it is and we love our family
 we love our faith
 we love our flag and we love our freedom and that's what it's about
 and add to that the fact that we love our neighbors and we love our- … the fact that we love our neighbors and we love our country
 together we are all united by one fundamental principal
 a nation's first duty must always be to its own citizens it's own
 we've got to take care of our own
 you haven't heard that from a politician or a political leader in a long time
 it's called america first
 it's america first
 we're thrilled to be joined tonight by many tremendous republican leaders and great friends of mine a man who's doing an incredible job as your governor because i want to take 100 of the credit for the incredible turnaround of new hampshire and i remember it not so long ago things were not looking good
 people were leaving a lot of bad things were happening but we have to give him a lot of credit
 he's been a great governor chris sununu with a great father too great father
 with a great father… his father was tough
 chris your father was so tough
 he was for somebody else in the primaries and then one by one… i won here i won there i won there
 and then when i won his father got on and i said oh this guy kills me
 he's so tough and he said president trump will be the greatest of all time
 i said what happened
 what happened
 he went from being the toughest critic to the best there is
 so i want to say hello to your father okay chris
 you'll tell him
 great guy
 what a family
 what a family
 thank you for chris
 new hampshire senate republican leader chuck morse
 chuck
 thanks chuck
 new hampshire house republican leader dick hinch
 thank you dick
 thank you dick
 great job
 a man who was with me right from the beginning
 in fact he had a meeting at his house
 his house has never been the same
 his house is a disaster now
 like somebody said he just sold it
 but you know what
 because of the trump economy i'll bet he sold it for a big big fat beautiful profit
 where is steve
 steve stepanek and his wife who's incredible
 did you make a lot of money on the house
 we destroyed the house
 this was the beginning
 he held some kind of a meeting for me and he has a nice house but literally hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people showed up and they destroyed his house
 it's never been the same
 no wonder you sold it
 they finally gave up and that was four years ago
 anyway thank you very much both for being here
 i appreciate it
 what great people
 thank you steve
 great job
 and i hope the buyer of his house didn't hear that little… steve
 i hope the buyer didn't hear what i just said about your house
 he'll cancel… that's all right
 you'll sell it for more to somebody else don't worry
 republican party chair ronna mcdaniel
 you know ronna headed up michigan and for many many years nobody won michigan as a republican
 but i used to complain i'd go there and i'd say they're stealing your car business
 i'd go for years
 in fact five or six years before i even thought about running for whatever reason they named me man of the year in michigan
 i said how come
 i didn't even understand it myself but i was named man of the year
 i wasn't even political
 that was years before i did this
 but i was always complaining that our car business is being stolen
 i mean it's sort of obvious right
 mexico now has 32 of our car business
 it all left the state of michigan
 we are bringing it back at a level that nobody's ever seen before our car business
 but i went to michigan and my opponent was told that the republicans no way you can win michigan or wisconsin that you just can't
 and we had a campaign manager named ronna mcdaniel and ronna wouldn't stop
 sir can you be here next week
 i say i don't know
 then i leave and she said sir can you come back in three days
 i said i don't know
 then i do it and she said how about another time
 and then on election night she said sir it was six o'clock the day before the election
 in other words just a short while before the election
 she calls me sir can you be here tonight
 i said tonight
 and by the way you know where i was
 i was in new hampshire
 that's right
 she said sir can you be here tonight
 i said are you sure
 i started speaking at one o'clock in the morning
 now it's election day
 we had 32000 people show up
 it was like this
 the crowd was just they want to see things happen in our country
 they love our country
 it went crazy
 i left and i said i don't know why going to lose michigan
 why would we lose michigan
 look at this
 the opponent went there with barack obama and michelle obama and she went there much earlier
 prime time one o'clock two o'clock in the morning is not exactly prime time
 we had 32000 and they had a tiny little crowd and i looked at my people and i said i know we're not supposed to win the great state of michigan but i think we're going to win michigan and we won michigan and we won wisconsin
 we won wisconsin
 wisconsin was a great victory and we won pennsylvania and we won north carolina and south carolina and we won florida and i hate to tell you we should've won new hampshire
 that was taken away
 new hampshire was taken away
 it was taken away from us but we should've
 we did great in new hampshire
 we should've won new hampshire but that's okay
 i'm not holding it against you because it was not your fault
 but we had a woman in michigan and i said when it came time to choosing the head of the republican national committee i said who the hell is that woman up in michigan that got me to keep coming there and explaining that we can't continue to lose our car business
 we have 17 companies now coming back in
 who is that woman
 and it was ronna
 we put her in charge of the republican national committee
 the job that she has done is incredible
 thank you
 the same with another man our campaign manager
 he started off as a computer genius and remember when they used to say that the hillary clinton campaign is highly sophisticated highly… she did a lot of bad things folks
 33000 emails deleted after getting a subpoena from the united states congress 33000
 remember she said it was about her daughter's wedding and yoga classes 33000 yes
 it was disgraceful
 i will tell you this we now have a great attorney general
 a fair guy a great gentleman
 another man who's here tonight is the world's tallest campaign manager
 he is an unbelievable talent
 but they were saying about our opponents… i'm not going to mention the name again because we'll never get it finished here so i'll just say my opponent
 is that better
 they were saying how sophisticated her campaign was
 except ours was far more sophisticated and we had a man that did an incredible job
 he's now our campaign manager and he's one of the tallest human beings i've ever seen
 his name is brad parscale and he is fantastic
 it's nice when you don't have to look for anybody
 you just look over and you see a guy who's twice as tall as everyone
 great job brad
 thank you
 how we doing brad
 good
 doing good
 got great poll numbers
 we've got great poll numbers in a lot of states ohio iowa
 you know iowa every week that they campaign our numbers go up
 they're winning iowa
 we gave them ethanol which is very important
 a lot of things for iowa but every week we seem to be going up in iowa because they're campaigning in iowa
 wherever they go our numbers go up
 somebody's going to have to explain that one to me someday but we like it
 a man who's a friend of mine who was the greatest mayor in the history of new york city
 stand up rudy
 stand up rudy
 rudy giuliani
 man he did a job in the first year
 i've never seen anything like it
 new york was crime infested
 we had problems
 we had problems like nobody would believe
 rudy went in there and he did the job and people loved him for it
 it wasn't like oh gee he's a horrible person
 people loved rudy giuliani
 he was a great great mayor
 so thank you rudy for being here
 the first person that i put on on the campaign he was driving me wild
 he said i'm saying you can win sir
 you can win
 i'm telling you you can win
 he loves this state
 he's from this state
 he said you can win sir
 i'm just telling you
 i had him on for month after month
 he'd come drive me crazy
 he'd say you can win you can win you can win
 and finally we said let's give it a shot
 and i had corey i had hope i had just a couple of people
 we had a rather lean and mean staff
 but corey lewandowski loves your state loves new hampshire
 he was the first one that talked about us possibly winning the whole big ballgame
 he's tough and he's smart and i'm hearing he's thinking about running for the senate from new hampshire
 there we go
 i think he'd be tough to beat
 i'll tell you one thing he'll go into washington and he's going to have you in mind
 he's going to do a job if he does do it so we'll see what happens
 he hasn't made up his mind yet but he would be fantastic
 i guess it's something you go back and you talk to your family you talk to your wife and you make a decision
 they're all saying are you going to support him
 i said i don't know if he's running
 so corey let us know please if you don't mind
 let us know
 our shared republican agenda is pro worker pro jobs pro family pro growth and 100 pro american
 for decades and decades the permanent politicians in washington pursued the very opposite
 they sold out our workers
 you see it
 you know it better than any place
 when i talk about the horrors of nafta the horrors of trade deals… i mean i'm sorry to tell you this i usually refer to new hampshire
 nobody took it worse than new england and nobody took it worse than new hampshire
 now here's the good news
 i would never let that happen again and chris will never let that happen again
 is there a doctor please
 doctor in the house
 thank you
 doctor in the house
 please doctor please
 thank you very much
 take your time
 yeah take your time
 thank you
 take your time fellas
 plenty of time
 you know people got here two and a half days ago many of these people in the front right
 two and a half days ago a lot of these people so you can understand
 it's pretty tough
 thank you
 thank you
 that's okay
 these are great people
 these are great people that love our country just remember that
 thank you very much
 thank you
 thank you very much
 pretty good
 pretty good
 so our politicians shipped away our jobs shed our sovereignty surrendered our dignity and saddled our nation in one foreign debacle after another and we're still here
 he just said it
 we're still here you better believe it and we're here stronger than ever before we're here
 but all of that ended the day that i took the oath of office the american people are in charge of their country again
 we cut a record number of job-killing regulations that were strangling our country
 we cut more regulations in two and a half years than any other president in their full terms
 four years eight years or in one case more than that cut more than anybody
 to get relief to working families we passed the largest package of tax cuts and tax reforms in the history of our country
 you're making a lot more money
 you're making a lot more money and you see it and you know it because you see it in your paycheck every week
 we ended the last administration's cruel war on american energy and we are delivering a policy of american energy independence like you've never seen before
 in fact if you look at the straits where we're having all of the problems you look at the straits number one they're not touching our ships they're not playing with our ships
 they're taking them from this country from that country from that country
 but you know what
 very importantly we have very few ships going there anymore because we don't need that oil and gas
 the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world
 every leading democrat has pledged abolish the american oil coal and natural gas industries that are fueling our economic boom
 can you imagine this
 we're sitting on great wealth
 they want to take it away from us and the alternatives don't have the power
 they don't have the power
 they want wind wind
 wind is oh so beautiful as long as you don't have to stare at a windmill and your house goes down in value like to nothing
 steve if you had a windmill anywhere near your house you would've gotten one third of the price you got steve
 that's true by the way
 steve's too smart to let that happen
 we won't let them take it away from you
 we are reversing decades of calamitous trade policies that shattered new hampshire and your factories
 they shattered your communities and they shattered american power and american prestige all around the globe
 new hampshire lost one in four manufacturing jobs following nafta and china's entrance into the organization two of the worst deals ever in the history of our world not just our country
 election after election politicians came to your state pretending to have the courage to stand up for the american worker then they went to washington and let other countries push them around and special interests buy them off and steal your jobs and take your companies
 that's what happened
 me i don't care about their campaign contributions
 it doesn't matter to me folks
 we want to do a job
 we want to do a great job and we're setting records and you know who's sending us the money
 the small donors
 well we have big donors but we have small donors are sending us the money for the election
 pretty amazing
 that's not supposed to happen to a republican but it's happening to this republican and it's happening to you
 every vow that politicians made was broken every hope was dashed and every promise turned into a total betrayal of new hampshire and of our country
 but in this administration we have something those sell-out politicians could only dream of
 it's called strength and commitment
 we don't play games
 we don't play games
 after years and years of building up other countries we are finally building up our country standing up for our jobs our workers and standing up for our dignity
 the forgotten men and women of america will never ever be forgotten again
 you were forgotten
 the last administration with sleepy joe and obama tried to ram through one of the worst trade deals ever negotiated worse than nafta worse than wto
 it was called the trans-pacific partnership
 it would have been a disaster
 tpp would have gutted the american auto industry
 it would have been in shambles
 our auto industry is coming back so strong
 it would've gutted would've destroyed the industry
 but in my first week in office i proudly withdrew the united states from that job-destroying catastrophe
 we're imposing beautiful well-placed tariffs money comes in on foreign countries that cheat our workers steal our jobs and break all the rules i'm sorry
 and by the way they've been changing and charging tariffs on us for years
 we have countries that charge us 100 200 297 in the case of canada with your farm products
 we're not going to stand for it and man did we turn things around and we've just started
 if companies don't want to pay a tariff i have one simple solution
 come make your product in america
 come make your product in new hampshire
 zero tariffs
 zero
 no tariff
 together we're restoring this nation's industrial might and we are doing it with american iron american aluminum and american steel
 we're doing it steel
 steel industry is high
 they were dumping steel all over
 they were destroying our companies
 us steel now all of them they're all expanding
 the steel industry is back
 it's doing great
 we're opening up mines in minnesota the great state of minnesota
 they have magnificent mines that have the best iron ore in the world and president obama closed them down
 maybe we can get representative omar from minnesota to open it up but i don't think so
 she'll open them up
 i don't think so
 representative omar that's another one
 we're replacing nafta with the brand new usmca
 that's mexico and canada
 great deal
 the usmca will create countless jobs for farmers and manufacturers all across the state
 we need congress to pass the usmca immediately
 we'll make it a bipartisan deal
 we don't even want credit
 the unions benefit
 the non-unions benefit
 everybody benefits
 it brings it back to fairness and it makes it very hard for our companies to leave our countries go to mexico or canada
 we lose all our jobs
 we lose all our taxes
 we end up with empty factories and plants
 it makes it almost impossible
 we're not going to have that
 that was my one rule that i had to have
 it's going to be very very hard for companies to do that
 i've also taken the toughest ever action to stand up to china's chronic trade abuses
 earlier this month the us government officially labeled china for the first time ever a currency manipulator another promise kept
 while others allowed china to freely loot the us economy 500 billion a year not million not million billion with a b
 we've made it clear that the theft of american jobs and american wealth is over
 yet today the wall street journal editorial board and some others continue to publish foolish articles that demonstrate that they understand nothing about trade or business
 nothing
 they advocate only economic surrender
 they actually say go to china take off the tariffs make a deal
 i lose all the cards we take off the tariffs
 we don't have any cards
 think of it
 they say go to europe

 by the way the european union is worse than china just smaller
 it treats us horribly
 barriers tariffs taxes and we let them come in
 it's worse than china
 many of us come from there
 i do
 that's what it's got going
 that's about it
 they treat us really badly and many others many many others
 india tariffs us probably higher than any nation anywhere in the world
 we have tariffs of 100 on products and much more than that
 india
 so we're working on all of them
 i called prime minister modi
 i said mr
 prime minister it's not fair
 we've got to change we've got to change we've got to change and we're talking to them very seriously
 we're talking to a lot of places
 but when the wall street journal comes out and they say  no no take the tariffs
 go and talk to china
 they've been trying to talk to them for 25 years
 but actually you know what
 they really haven't
 the fact is the leaders that were in my position they didn't do a damn thing
 they didn't talk
 they didn't talk
 past leaders followed the terrible advice of these editorial boards that are frankly totally inexperienced in business i guess and our industries were utterly decimated
 globalism enriches foreign countries at our expense
 globalism
 i love our country
 i'm the president of the united states of america
 i'm not the president of the the world
 as long as i'm president america will never bow to a foreign nation like we were for so many years
 as we restore our prosperity we are also restoring public safety
 we are fighting to reduce violent crime
 you see so much and over the last 25 years so much crime and ensure that every american can live in safety and peace
 and yet with all that you see we've had one of the best years of crime prevention that we've ever had
 it wouldn't seem that way but it is one of the best years because those gentlemen that we just saw the law enforcement they do a great job
 you've been reading about this a lot lately
 we are working very hard to make sure we keep guns out of the hands of insane people and those who are mentally sick and shouldn't have guns
 but people have to remember however that there is a mental illness problem that has to be dealt with
 it's not the gun that pulls the trigger
 it's the person holding the gun
 years ago many cities and states i remember it so well closed mental institutions for budgetary reasons
 they let those people out onto the street
 you probably have your examples up here
 i can tell you in new york they closed so many of them and they let really seriously mentally ill people out on the streets and you see plenty of them today even today
 we're going to have to give major consideration to building new facilities for those in need
 we have to do it
 and at the same time we will be taking mentally deranged and dangerous people off of… … mentally deranged and dangerous people off of the streets so we won't have to worry so much about that
 the big problem
 we don't have those institutions anymore and people can't get proper care
 they're seriously ill people and they're on the streets
 we can't make it harder for good solid law abiding citizens to protect themselves
 we will always uphold the right to self defense and we will always uphold the second amendment
 we will
 so important
 one of the most powerful promises i made to the people of this state was to confront the opioid and drug epidemic
 i used to go around new hampshire more than any state and you'd say sir the state is infested
 you said sir we'll like a drug den
 you tell me
 and i didn't really see it
 and then i met with the police officers and fire departments and all the people that do
 and you just seem to have a bigger problem
 and by the way the wall is being built
 that's- that's going to stop a lot of it
 the wall is being built
 build the wall
 build the wall
 build the wall
 build the wall
 build the wall
 build the wall
 build the wall
 it's being built
 you know we have the fake news
 you know about that where they … a wall that's lying on the ground in a very important section
 so we pick up the wall it's in pieces
 i mean literally it's gone and we build a brand new 30 foot steel and concrete wall and the fake media said he didn't build a wall
 that's just renovation
 there was no wall it's lying on the ground
 people walk right over and it's rotted rusted gone
 we take it away
 we put a brand new wall up
 they give me no credit
 you know why
 because they're fake news
 that's why
 we're building a lot of walls
 the army corps of engineers is doing a great job
 they're doing a great job
 since i took office we've attacked the challenge with everything we have
 we have secured a record 6 billion in new funding
 opioid
 we vastly increase the distribution of overdose reversing drugs which are pretty amazing things
 we've given them to your police department your fire department pretty amazing
 we have reduced the total amount of opioids prescribed by 34
 the department of justice has prosecuted more than 3000 defendants in opioids related cases
 and our public awareness campaign about the terrible suffering that drugs inflict has already reached 58 of all young americans
 i said that you have to show them
 we're doing ads beautiful ads
 shows them and you've seen them
 i don't even want to describe them
 they're brutal
 but we're doing ads on television and papers about how bad it is for children so they can see it
 because the greatest thing we can do is not get people started on drugs right
 not get them started
 it's hard to get off
 you know we can get them off and we're doing it and it's been done
 but it's hard to get off
 if they never start
 it's real easy
 it's real easy
 so we're trying to get young kids you won't see the fruits of this labor for a little while because it takes a while
 but we're really we are working so hard on advertising and promotions to tell young kids children how bad drugs are how dangerous they are how horrible they are how they destroy your brain how they do so many bad things
 and they're really very tough ads
 they're hard hitting ads
 and i think they're having a big impact
 you'll see over time you'll see
 over time you'll see
 but we still have much work to do
 but as a result of these efforts last year we saw the first nationwide decline in drug overdose deaths in 31 years
 that's pretty amazing
 and at the center of america's drug crisis is the border crisis
 vast quantities of deadly narcotics are being smuggled across the border including meth cocaine heroin and fentanyl
 and as part of my trade deal with china it's been very important
 and president xi said he's going to do it
 so far he has not done it
 but i said you have to stop sending us fentanyl
 have to
 and you have to criminalize in china the making of fentanyl
 and so far he has not come through but i think he will
 you'll know you'll know
 yet democrats want to open borders and republicans want strong borders
 that you're difference
 one wants open borders
 who can even think of an open border
 think of it
 even though many people that come into our country are wonderful people they're are still coming in illegally
 they're not coming in through merit
 but what about the bad ones
 we have serious serious criminals that want to come in and if we had open borders they would be flowing in like you've never seen before
 democrats want open borders they don't mind crime
 we do mind crime and that's the way it is
 democrats also support deadly sanctuary cities
 last year alone sanctuary cities declined more than 17000 requests from federal authorities to hand over criminal aliens already in their custody
 in other words 17000 criminal aliens were released by these cities directly into us communities
 you don't understand even what the hell are they doing
 what are they doing
 17000
 republicans believe our city should be sanctuaries for law abiding americans not for criminal aliens
 we will always support the amazing heroes of ice and border patrol and we will always support law enforcement
 every democrat candidate also wants to give illegal immigrants free welfare
 republicans believe public benefits should be protected for truly needy americans not for illegal aliens
 and we should reduce our taxes and many other things with all of that money that we're talking about
 we need to elect a strong republican majority to end sanctuary cities
 stop human traffickers stop drug smugglers and adopt an immigration system that puts the needs of american workers and families first
 it's also time for democrats to join with us to protect the sacred integrity of our elections by supporting voter id voter identification
 it's incredible
 they're constantly saying oh we need to protect them
 but they're not looking for that
 they're not looking for that
 we say what about voter id
 in other words you have a picture you have to go up
 what about voter id
 that they don't want to do but we need voter id
 the democrat party has never been farther outside the mainstream
 where do they come from
 you know you say you want low taxes good education strong military strong borders
 you want to have safe homes
 you want a house you want low interest rates you've got low … hey you got low interest rates
 the lowest ever
 got low rates it's a good time to refinance your house by the way
 great time
 you got everything and then you see these people they're against … they have no idea what they're doing
 they have no idea what they're against
 every major democrat running for president supports a massive government takeover of healthcare that would raid medicare and destroy the private health insurance plans of millions of american families that they love
 my administration is defending your right to choose the plan and the doctor that is best for you
 the individual mandate is gone
 the most unpopular part of obamacare and we almost have obamacare gone
 we're close
 we would have had it before but we had a vote that was a little bit surprising
 i'm sure none of you knew who that vote was
 we had it done repealed and replaced
 but it's going to happen and i think it's going to actually be in the end actually better
 you watch
 so we got rid of the individual mandate which was the most unpopular part of obamacare
 and we're running it better
 you know i had a political decision
 do i make it great
 alex azar our secretary do rerun it well and sort of say hey we run it well
 or do we run it badly and have everybody upset
 we said we got to run it well but it's still much too expensive
 it's lousy healthcare
 but we got rid of the worst part of it
 individual mandate individual mandate where you have the privilege of buying the right not to have to pay for expensive insurance
 that's no good health insurance
 and we won't … and you got to remember this
 republicans and i speak for every one of them we will always protect pre-existing conditions
 we're going to protect always
 right got to do it
 our ambitious campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs has produced the largest decline in drug prices in 51 years
 the only decline in 51 years
 we have launched a historic initiative to require price transparency empowering you to choose the lowest price for yourself and for your family
 believe it or not you didn't have the right to go in and price your drugs
 who could even believe this
 i wonder if big pharma had something to do with that
 so we're going to have transparency
 virtually every top democrat also now supports late term abortion ripping babies straight from the mothers womb
 right up up till … right up until the moment of birth
 and in the case of the virginia governor he's having a rough rough time
 in his case the baby is born and then he goes to talk to the mother
 the doctor talks to the mother
 the baby is now born wrapped as he said and then they decide whether or not to execute the baby
 who would believe that
 that is why i've asked congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because republicans believe that every child is a sacred the gift of god
 hard to believe isn't that
 democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion and socialism
 the republican party is the party of freedom
 we are the party of the american worker the american family and the american dream and i'm fighting for you each and every day
 so importantly we have confirmed more than 140 federal judges
 within 90 days it will be 179 federal judges
 thank you very much president obama
 thank you very much
 i don't know what happened to them but i came to office and i had 138 judges that were not appointed by president obama
 so i say thank you mr
 president very good and they'll say he was a great president
 oh the fake news
 he was a great president
 if he was a great president how come he left me 138 judges to appoint when everybody says that's the single most important thing a president of the united states has to do
 great president
 he was great
 he was a great president
 and these judges will apply the law as written including we appointed two great supreme court justices neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh
 and to help patients with life threatening illnesses we also pass something i'm so proud of 44 years they couldn't get it passed right to try
 you can use our newest our best medicines
 incredible
 what's happening
 i'm so proud of that
 and this from forever five decades
 we pass for our great veterans va choice and va accountability
 and one of our great friends was a veteran who's been with me in new hampshire
 i don't know where you are
 where's our guy
 where is he
 so al
 so i walk in i said hello
 he's been with me from the beginning
 he wasn't with … he liked trump
 and i came in
 he said sir he's a great veteran
 he said sir i have cancer
 and sir i went into the vet
 they were very very late
 they had problems
 i'm not blaming them but they gave me the right to go out and get a great cancer surgeon
 he had his operation
 you look much better than you did three years ago al much better
 much better
 va choice right al
 va choice
 great story
 thank you very much and thank you for your loyalty
 he's been to every rally i ever gave a new hampshire right from the beginning
 i got so tired of looking at him
 he'd always be here
 now he's … look at him now he's sitting in very good
 that's good
 but i appreciate that story
 i appreciate
 va choice just makes sense right
 doesn't it make sense
 we've achieved record funding for the united states military
 716 billion 700 billion and 738 billion
 and it's almost completely rebuilt
 including and we hope to god we never have do use it
 we have the finest most powerful nuclear capability anywhere on the face of the earth
 and i hope to god we never have to use it
 we're investing in the future of human space flight
 and someday soon american astronauts will plant the stars and stripes on the surface of mars
 i told my guys at nasa you know nasa when we took it over it was exhausted
 the runways and the grounds had all weeds growing through the cracks in the concrete
 you wouldn't recognize it now
 it's beautiful
 it's the best place anywhere on earth
 and i also said though you know i hear all these rich guys for some reason they love space
 so they're rich
 i said let them send the rockets up
 what the hell do we have to do it
 right
 so i see jeff bezos and elon musk they're putting rockets up
 i think it's great
 and they pay us rent
 they use our facility
 that's great
 but we're also doing it and nasa has some of the greatest plans we've ever had
 these are great people great scientists
 but we also let the private sector put up rockets
 the one which recently went up and you see the engines coming back down and they coming … there's no wings no nothing
 it's almost like what are we watching is this fiction
 and they come down and they save all of the propellants
 all of the really the most expensive parts
 they're able to save it by bringing it back right to where it took off
 who would think they could do this
 i never saw this before six months ago but they're doing it now more and more
 they're saving a lot of the most important and expensive parts of rockets
 so we have a lot of rich guys paying us a lot of rent
 but we're also doing it ourselves
 to protect america's security
 i withdrew the united states from the horrible one-sided iran nuclear deal
 i recognized israel's true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem
 and just three months ago we also recognized the golan heights as being a part of and protected by israel
 for years you watched as your politicians apologized for america
 now you have a president who is standing up for america and we are standing up for the people of new hampshire
 thank you
 and you must never forget the 2020 election right around the corner
 2020 right around the corner
 and it's about one thing
 you know what the one thing is you
 it's about you
 it's about your family
 it's about your future
 and it's about the fate of your country
 so when we ran together last time we said the most importantly we had to turn it around
 this country was going bad
 you see what happened to venezuela with socialism
 venezuela 15 years ago was one of the richest countries
 now they don't have water they don't have food they don't have anything
 and this was one of the richest nations in the world
 they don't have anything
 we're working on it
 we're helping people but it's very sad
 it's never going to happen to us because we will never ever be a socialist nation
 ever
 no matter what label they use a vote for any democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction … the destruction of the american dream
 we have a dream
 it's a great dream
 this the destruction of the american dream
 we begin this campaign tonight with the best record the best results the best agenda and the only positive vision for the people of new hampshire and for the people of america
 together we will lift millions more citizens from welfare to work dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity
 millions and millions of people
 with your help we will elect a republican congress to create a safe modern fair and lawful system of immigration
 we will enact trade deals that are already happening that ensure more products are proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase made in the usa
 we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine ending the aids epidemic in america and finding new cures for childhood cancer
 something i never thought i'd be able to say within one decade the aids epidemic in the united states will be gone
 think of that
 did you ever think you were going to hear that
 no
 did you ever think you were going to hear that
 the work they've done on aids is incredible
 that's an incredible thing
 when they told me that it's just shattering
 it just it breaks your heart what's happened
 but think of it in 10 years the aids epidemic will be eradicated
 so great
 who thought that was going to be happening
 who thought i'd be able to get to say that so early in what we're doing together
 we will defend privacy free speech free assembly religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms
 above all we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together
 there is one america we will support protect and defend the constitution of the united states
 we'll stand with the incredible men and women of law enforcement
 we believe in the dignity of work and in the sanctity of life
 we believe that faith and family not government and bureaucracy are the true american way
 we believe that children should be taught to love our country honor our history and to always respect our great american flag
 through every day and every challenge our hearts speak to the words of the new hampshire state motto live free or die
 we are fighting for every american mom and dad who wants to protect this land of liberty for their precious beautiful children
 we are fighting for every young boy and girl who deserves to grow up in a nation of builders and dreamers pioneers and patriots and we are fighting for every citizen of the greatest republic on the face of this earth
 every day my presidency we will never forget that we are americans and the future belongs to us
 the brave this beautiful strong proud and free future
 it belongs to us
 it's up to us
 we control our own destiny
 and with your help your devotion and your drive
 we are going to keep on working
 we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning winning winning
 we are one great movement
 one people one family and one glorious nation under god
 and together we are making america wealthy again
