thank you thank you very much
 thank you very much
 that is a beautiful site right behind me isn't it
 that's a beautiful site
 thank you very much
 and a very big hello wisconsin we've been very good together
 and i'm thrilled to be with thousands of loyal hard-working american patriots
 47 days from now we're going to win wisconsin and we're going to win four more years in the white house
 this is the most important election in the history of our country
 i feel that way so strongly so do you
 joe biden devoted his entire career to offshoring wisconsin jobs outsourcing your factories throwing open your borders dragging us into endless ridiculous foreign wars and surrendering your children's future to china
 you know what he's been doing
 i just see he's up there tonight getting softball questions from anderson cooper
 they don't ask me questions like that
 and the audience isn't quite like this
 do you see what his audience … they've got cars
 they have car in a parking it's the weirdest thing i've ever seen
 and cnn is going oh this is so beautiful
 it's not beautiful
 they have cars in a parking lot
 what a deal i'll tell you what a deal
 biden's supported every disasterous global sellout for half a century including a nafta china
 you take a look at china's entry into the world trade organization and tpp
 he supported them all biden surrendered your jobs to china and you know that
 i probably wouldn't be here if it weren't for that it was one of the big things one of the big reasons i decided to say to my great wife our first lady let's go have some fun
 let's go have some fun
 she's done a great job and very popular
 and the family is all over the place all over the country
 but unlike joe who lets you down when he'd never even came back to milwaukee to apologize or just to pay respects i came to wisconsin and i've been here a lot since since we started this a lot
 and you've been a tremendous beneficiary of what i've done and i have to because you've been with me you've supported me and we've had great victories together all victories so i want to thank you
 now biden wants to surrender our country to the violent left-wing mob
 you see what's happening
 if biden wins very simple china wins
 if biden wins the mob wins
 if biden wins the rioters anarchists arsonists and flag burners they win and we're not into flag burners
 we don't like flag burners
 i'd like to say pass a law one year in jail you started burning flags we put you in jail for a year
 we should do that
 they would have done that it's a different world i guess but it's sort of coming back to the way we have to have it because we're for law and order
 they say don't use that term it's too tough
 no everybody wants law and order
 minorities want law and order
 everybody wants law and order
 they have to have it
 i'm running for the reelection and a very important reelection to bring jobs in factories back and that's a continuation
 because i don't know if you know it the single greatest year wisconsin has ever had was last year
 the second best year that wisconsin has ever had was the year before
 and guess what the third was the year before that
 and you're going to have your best year economically next year it's all heading in that direction despite the pandemic given to us by china
 we want to put the violent criminals behind bars and we have to ensure the future belongs to america not to china not to other very terrible forces out there because if we win very simply america wins
 and that's what we want we want this great country to win
 over the last three and a half years we've secured america's borders
 fixed the disastrous trade deals they have been the worst ever
 not even … it was not even … when i looked at these i studied them and i used to talk about them they had to be bad
 when i started studying i said who are the people that made these deals
2 grossly incompetent people
 brought back our manufacturing jobs rebuilt the awesome power of the u
s
 military and obliterated the isis caliphate
 we open obliterated it
 obama was not able to do it he wasn't able to come close
 it was just announced that in 2019 before the virus came in from china we grew median income by a record of 4400 in just one year achieving the highest median income in u
s
 history
 that's in the history of our country
 in the first three years we lifted six point six million people out of poverty the largest poverty reduction of any president in the history of our country
 that's not bad
 and i didn't even make these numbers up
 these are numbers that … they sound good to me
 we built the greatest economy in the history of a world
 this is the greatest economy in the history of the world
 and then the virus came in we closed it down we saved millions and millions of lives
 we'd be at two and a half million two million three million
 a number that would not be sustainable would not be acceptable
 a horrible number there shouldn't have been one person that died
 it should have been stopped at china
 they stopped it for their country but it came out to us to europe to the rest of the world 188 countries
 we will deliver a safe and effective vaccine before the end of the year
 and it could be very very soon
 you've been seeing what's going … could be very very soon
 could be it's amazing how all of a sudden they hate the vaccine
 when they thought it couldn't be done they said well he's got to get a vaccine
 and then all of a sudden they're looking like it's going to be very close
 we're doing great
 we're doing great with vaccines and therapeutics remdesivir all sorts of other things that are bringing the rates down like at numbers that nobody can believe
 but we have three vaccines right now they're in the final stage clinical trials
 we worked it for the fda where they approved it fast
 they went very fast very quick at levels that nobody else could have ever achieved
 no other administration certainly the last one because the last one was grossly incompetent
 in fact that's why i'm here because if it was good i wouldn't have run
 if they did their job i wouldn't have run
 i was very happy in my other life
 i was very happy but i'm very happy in this life
 more happy because nobody has produced in three and a half years the first three and a half years nobody has done what we have been able to do nobody
 so we'll defeat the virus and next year will be truly i think from an economic standpoint and from other standpoints maybe the best year of all
 hard to believe we're going so fast the numbers have been incredible
 we've had employment numbers the best ever
 we've had retail sales numbers the best ever
 you see them all they come out every day
 and our stock market is for the most part at a new high
 and if people have 401ks if you want to have your 401k go down like to depression levels i think you should vote for sleepy joe because he's going to raise your interest
 he'll be raising your interest rates
 i watch him though he's denying all this up
 everything that he said he's now denying
 he said no fracking right
 there will be no fracking during the … he didn't know what fracking was but he said there's no fracking
 the reason is because everybody else all of the radical left candidates up there they couldn't get too far left so joe agreed
 then he gets the nomination now they're all angry
 you know that crazy bernie all of the left democrats they don't want to vote for him anymore because he made promises and now all of a sudden he forgot that he said no fracking
 he said well now we can do some fracking
 but remember this in politics it's always the thing that they say first that's what they're going to do
 no guns no religion no energy no oil remember that
 remember he put beto in charge of his gun policy right
 beto crazy beto
 remember when beto went out he said i was born for this
 and that's when it all came down
 as soon as i heard that anybody said they were born for this that doesn't play well
 but he's in charge of the second amendment
 and you won't have a second amendment
 frankly you wouldn't have a second amendment if i didn't get elected it would have been obliterated
 it would have been torn up
 maybe it would have been totally knocked out
 but there's tremendous pressure on your second amendment
 as long as i'm here you'll always have a second amendment
 but i want to just say they do disinformation they make up a phony story and then they go with it
 they make up a totally phony story
 it's called disinformation
 and one of the things oh what they did the worst of all was the soldiers
 because nobody loves our soldiers like i do and they made up a phony deal
 and that's why i say the gloves are off because when they do that that's worse than what i'm going to talk to you about that's big 10
 you know we got it back right
 we got big 10
 but the soldier story about standing over their graves you know the one i'm talking about then they do a commercial
 and i said the good news about that is the gloves are off
 i can now call him grossly incompetent the man is incompetent
 he's been there for 47 years he didn't do a thing
 now all of a sudden in years where he was never considered smart but now he's really not considered smart
 and now all of a sudden he's going to do what he never did in 47 years
 he's got to do this and that and everything that i'm doing everything that we're doing
 but i want to congratulate the big 10 conference on yesterday's announcement that the fall season will start very soon
 oh i hope your team does well after all that
 i hope that team does well
 but i especially want to thank a football legend he was great
 wisconsin's own barry alvarez he was great
 good got to be careful when you do that a lot of times you don't like people too much
 they say oh but he's a good man
 we worked with him
 we worked with a whole group including the commissioner of the league did a very very good job did a very good job
 but we called them and the reason is that they took an ad
 in other words another one disinformation
 they took an ad saying i was against football
 i'm the one that said they shouldn't close
 but i said that if they close they close
 but then they took an ad saying i'm the one i didn't want it
 i wanted it closed
 so then i said well no i don't
 i want it open
 let me call up the commissioner
 we called up the commissioner and he was great
 he said you really think so
 and bottom line we worked very hard lots of calls to lots of different states lots of people
 we dealt with the players the parents of the players who are really the boss that's okay i won't say that
 but these are players that have a shot at the nfl
 they have a shot at pro-football
 we want the nfl to proudly stand when they sing our national anthem
 or their ratings are going to continue to go down like they did last weekend down 27
 because people don't want that
 you know what we have enough politics right
 we have politics here
 we have politics all over
 in fact sometimes i have to turn it off
 i can't do it anymore
 i can't watch me
 it's always … i can't watch me
 i can't watch
 but no we have enough politics
 we don't want to watch now on sunday all here we go again with the politics let them play football let them stand and salute or put your hand on your heart and be proud of our country and be proud of our great american flag
 and then go home to the mansion and have a good time
 take a nice sauna and then if you want after you recover you come out and you go and you do your thing whatever the thing may be
 but people don't want to see it and the ratings are down
 here we go again
 i thought we taught them that lesson two years ago
 didn't we think
 i thought we taught that lesson
 but biden would absolutely eradicate your state's economy
 i know this state very well
 it's one of the reasons i made the great deal with canada and mexico but canada because they were taking advantage of you so badly on your dairy products
 you had a 287 tariff on your dairy products with canada
 people don't realize canada is one of the toughest negotiators and they treated your state and this country very unfairly until i came along very very unfairly
 did you know that
 287
 but i saw some farmers and this was like the straw that broke the camel's back
 they had something called specialty milk
 does anybody know what that is
 right you know
 a lot of people … it's a small little grouping of milks specialty milk
 but this was the final straw
 and i met some people and canada finally did it to them like they did it to everybody else
 and they raised a tariffs massively they made it impossible
 they tried to take over that business too along with all of them it was just massive and horrible what they did
 and that really got me going the little specialty milk specialty products a small portion but you know what that was it
 and we have a great deal
 the usmca is a great deal and i'm very honored to have done it
 but it was all because of specialty milk and the way you were taken advantage of by canada
 you know they have the wonderful oh canada we love to hear the song right
 but let me tell you they are very tough
 and they've taken advantage of our country for many many years
 and i will tell you this they're not so happy now but at least they got a deal but you're happy
 and it's about time you were happy
 you now have a great deal and you're not going to have your companies leaving for mexico anymore or canada
 and you're not going to have them make your product in mexico or canada send it over here with no tariff with no tax
 where we lose tax we lose jobs we lose our companies we lose everything
 and they make a lot of money selling the product to us same product
 so we're not doing that stuff anymore
 there's a tremendous disincentive it's called like let's not do it
 and you haven't seen that lately
 you haven't seen too many companies leaving have you
 it's sort of an amazing thing
 it's a little bit like what we did with the statues
 so on the statutes they were knocking them down three or four months ago
 i said do we have any laws
 no but there was a very old law
 i said what was it
 you get 10 years in jail 10 years in prison they actually use the word prison which is a tough word
 you get 10 years in prison if you knocked down a statue or a monument
 i said let me see that law i want to see that law
 right glen right
 i want to see that law
 thank you
 thank you
 thank you
 thank you very much
 so big tax cuts big regulation cuts
 the democrats they want to … the democrats they want to just really break us down in terms of our competitive ability to compete with other nations
 do you notice what's happening with japan
 you notice what's … we have taken billions and billions of dollars in from china
 we charge them a fortune
 in fact many farmers in this group because you got to love trump
 i gave you 28 billion right
 thank you very much china right
 you were targeted
 12 billion sonny purdue secretary of agriculture
 i said sonny how much have they been hit for targeted for
 remember when china said we're not going to do anything we're not buying
 they thought they were going to put pressure on us
 sonny said sir 12 billion the year before last and last year was 16 total of 28 billion
 we took 28 billion out of the tariffs
 china never paid us 25 cents not 25 cents with obama and biden
 and in all fairness with no president they paid us nothing
 they pay us now tens of billions of dollars
 i took a small portion of it i added it up 16 and 12 28 and i said 28 billion is going to the farmers
 did everybody get that money right
 you had a very good year the farmers have had a very good year
 last week china ordered and you have to understand i view china differently now than i did six months ago we made a great trade deal but i view it differently because i don't know if i can ever view it the same
 but last week they know how i feel and they're very smart
 so instead of saying we're not going to do business which would have been okay with me
 we would have worked it out somehow you would have been very successful the farmers
 but last week they had the largest order of corn
 did you know this
 in the history of our country
 did anyone know this the farmers
 from china thank you very much
 the largest order of soybeans in the history of our country
 and one of the largest cattle orders in the history of our country because they're very smart
 somebody else would have said well let's not do business
 and then it would have been easy for me but they gave us so much
 i have every farmer calling up saying please do me a favor
 we love this
 we love this
 this is a great deal
 it's a great deal but we feel differently about it don't we
 we just feel differently about it
 i don't talk about it like i used to i talked about it it was great
 and it turned out to be a great deal but i don't talk about it the same way
 at no time before has there been a clearer choice between two parties two visions two philosophies or two agendas for the future than these two parties you got law and order on one side and you have chaos on the other
 on november 3rd wisconsin will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity or whether we will allow biden and the democrats to impose a four trillion dollar tax hike ban american energy confiscate your guns which is what they want to do
 shut down the economy destroy the suburbs
 you know they were destroying our suburbs you know that right
 i don't know if somebody said you just doing okay in the suburbs
 i said how can i do okay i saved the suburbs
 what i've done is saved the suburbs
 and you know this i don't have to go into it but i saved the suburbs
 i think the suburbs … last time four years ago oh he's not going to do well with women
 i did great with women
 they said well a big thing
 remember that

 no but was that one of the greatest evenings ever remember
 and remember all the fake news look at all the … oh la that's a lot
 that's a lot of people back there
 look at that the red lights are on
 don't worry i won't say anything bad about you cnn
 because as soon as i see as soon as i- because as soon as i see … as soon as i'm getting ready to say something about fake news et cetera et cetera the lights start going off so i'm not going to … one just went off i think
 you can tell by the lights they got that little beautiful red light
 you see it
 but i won't say anything bad about them but they are fakers and do you remember when they … remember when they were saying that the polls are terrible
 actually these polls are very good compared … that was so bad it was like why did anybody vote
 they're called suppression polls
 they make them so bad that you lose all your appetite you lose all your spirit they take your guts out and you don't go and vote and your wife looks at you and says darling i love that guy but he's not going to win
 he doesn't have a chance because the polls he's down 10 he's down 20 he's down 50 points darling
 he can't possibly win
 let's go have dinner and then we'll come home and watch his concession speech
 but my people didn't buy that because my people went out to vote
 instead we watched her concession speech
 crooked hillary that was a real piece of work
 remember when she was saying will you accept the decision of the voters
 will you accept that decision
 i wasn't perfect i said i'll see how it works out
 i should have said yes i will but i couldn't do that because i know how crooked she is
 would you accept the decision
 the anchor said to me like will you accept
 they're coming after me i said you're supposed to be going after her a little bit too
 did you ever see debates where you had all of the anchors plus the candidates against me
 here we sit is that air force one yes that's air force one
 how did that happen
 a lot of the times i'd say to the anchor i'd say wait a minute
 wait a minute
 this isn't fair
 i mean i'm watching what they're doing with biden where he's using teleprompters move it up move it up i can't see i can't see
 he's shot
 he's shot
 president xi of china is not shot
 putin is not shot
 kim jong-un remember we're supposed to be in a war with him what happened to the war
 no it seems to be good
 did you see the middle east two days ago
 remember our incompetent negotiator john kerry
 he never got up to walk
 the guy's getting beaten on every point i say walk
 walk
 get up and leave the table
 you're giving up
 they'd say we want this
 he'd say well i'd rather not
 we want this
 okay you got it
 we want that
 you got it
 we want that
 say no and walk
 they'll probably possibly call you back and if they don't that's okay too
 but right now i will tell you iran if we win iran will be calling us within the first week they're dying to make a deal
 gdp down 27
 they don't have too much money for terror anymore it's actually amazing do you notice what's going on
 now i don't want to speak too loud but i did put out on social media the other day that if they hit us in any way any form written instructions already done we're going to hit them 1000 times harder than we've ever hit them before
 so hopefully they will just come and we'll make a deal and they'll go back to being a rich country let them go back and be rich but they cannot have a nuclear weapon
 they cannot
 that deal was so bad that obama made
 150 billion they got 150 billion for nothing
 you know the deal is practically … if i didn't terminate it which i'm proud to have done but if i didn't terminate it they got 1
8 billion in cash how about that
 if i didn't terminate that stupid deal first of all you wouldn't have the deal in the middle east and all these countries are joining it's happening fast
 they want to all join
 we did it you know the reverse
 we did it the … thank you very much
 thank you very much
 you know it's interesting thank you very much
 i knew i like you
 so the nobel peace prize
 so the funny thing a lot of people don't know because the fake news doesn't write about it
 so if you're a president right
 and you are nominated for the nobel peace prize you're the united states no but think of this
 that's a big deal
 i mean obama got it like in his first couple of weeks and nobody knew why he got it including him remember
 he couldn't tell you why
 he had no idea
 to this day he has no idea why he got it
 but if you're a president and you get nominated then two days later you get nominated did you know this a second time for a different deal
 kosovo
 serbia
 they've been killing each other for hundreds of years
 i stopped a lot of death and i did it like easy it wasn't hard for me
 it's sort of a natural thing to do but we did a good thing
 but you know what
 they did a check
 so i got nominated twice for the nobel peace prize that's a big deal i don't know
 i should have gotten nominated seven times because we did a lot of other things but these are for two different deals and not one mention was made on the evening news
 think of it
 i got rid of the prosecutor here's the billion right
 but they don't want to play that too often
 you have to look around for it
 it's a very unfair deal but as the expression goes we won i don't know how the hell we did it
 when you look at the opposition when you look at how unfair it is and these guys know very well you look at how unfair it is it's pretty damn good but we have a lot of support
 we have tremendous support of the people
 these rallies look at this rally
 these rallies … these rallies are incredible gap ever polled
 i'm not a believer in the polls but i believe that one
 it's the biggest enthusiasm gap he's got no enthusiasm
 the only enthusiasm is for the people that want to beat us they want to beat me
 that's the only thing he's got the people that want to … they couldn't care less about him
 he could be that piece of wood that was left in the ground
 biden will hand the left wing mob the keys to your kids' classroom
 earlier today i took a historic stand against the hateful lies being fed to america's youth the parents know all about it
 i checked they're doing it in wisconsin too
 i was a little surprised i'm a little surprised
 i'm a little surprised you let it happen actually but we're going to get rid of it
 i announced that we're launching a new pro-american lesson plan for students called 1776 commission
 we're going to teach our children the truth about america that we're the most exceptional nation ever to exist and we're getting better every single day
 sleepy joe biden is wholly owned and controlled by the far left
 he even opposed sending the national guard into a place called kenosha did you ever hear of kenosha
 how about that did we do a good job
 i wish we did it a little sooner but we finally got your governor's okay
 we have to do that if … we got to get the governors to say please do it
 how they don't do it how they don't do it in some other places when you look at what's going on with chicago right
 when you look at what's going on with portland those are just anarchists
 you know how long it would take us to fix up portland in terms of ending it all
 i'd say far less than an hour i'd say a half hour
 look what we did at minneapolis
 we're doing well in minnesota because they saw what happened
 now they shouldn't have allowed it to go on for 11 days they should have called us immediately but do you remember that beautiful night
 nice evening a little problem there were a lot of buildings in the background that were burning down to the ground as reporters said no this is a peaceful protest
 i don't know if it's your state but a couple of them they have … you're allowed to protest so you can't go to church but you can rip the hell out of the streets of main street of 5th avenue break up the stores
 burn down the buildings
 climb over each other's face you can climb right over their face
 you don't have to wear masks you don't have to do anything
 25000 people walking down the street looters anarchists agitators burning down stores throwing things at police
 they've taken the authority away from our police our great police
 they've taken their authority and their dignity away
 we're giving it back we have to we have to
 by the way i was endorsed by new york's finest and we're with them all the way
 i was just endorsed two days ago by chicago police
 i think that takes courage right
 philadelphia florida texas everybody ohio
 i don't know did anybody … is there one group of … even if it was a tiny little group of two or three police did anybody endorse sleepy joe
 i don't think so
 but we did a great job in kenosha
 we got out there i went there as you know a little while ago but had we not gone in that place would … it would have been burned to the ground
 they did damage we should have gone in
 i wanted to go in the first night we would have stopped it immediately but it was a great outcome as was in minnesota
 again if they would have called us early it would have been over
 portland i'd love to go there
 that would be so easy
 you know in seattle they heard we were coming in they gave up
 they heard we … i said that's enough
 we're going in
 i don't care
 we're going in
 do you have permission
 no we're going in
 they took over a chunk of the city and when they heard we were going in it's like well we give up that's it
 that was the end of the settle problem
 it's a terrible thing that's going on
 all in democratic run super liberal run cities
 the red cities are doing great
 i think we're doing great all over the republican cities we're fair
 we're not stupid
 how stupid these people are
 did you see chicago
 48 people shot six died
 you know we're in afghanistan we're pulling the troops you know that we're coming back we're almost finished
 we're pulling … finally these endless wars
 these endless wars and we had to fight other things but we've done a great job but we're acting like a police force over there
 no we're pulling the troops we're almost out of iraq
 that's another one we're down to about 2000 troops did you know that sean
 2000 troops
 so syria we're out but we kept the oil so we have some … was it okay that we at least kept the oil
 i feel badly because we have some troops … well you haven't pulled the troops
 no no we're gone we pulled all the troops out of syria
 remember we were supposed to be guarding the border between syria and turkey
 i said why are we doing that
 they said well we are
 i said wait a minute we have an army of 100000 here an army of 25000 30000 here
 we got 5000 soldiers
 that's a very dangerous position to be in
 i don't like it
 they've been guarding their own borders with different names for a thousand years
 why the hell do we have to be over there guarding their border
 we want to guard our own borders right where we're doing very well
 where we're doing very well
 we're doing great on our southern border i hate to say this but that wall is going up very rapidly 10 miles a week
 we're up to 330 miles and the wall will be finished very soon
 you think that was easy that was not easy our great congressman over here that was not easy
 the democrats were totally in favor of the wall until i said when i came in we will build the wall
 as soon as i said it they were against the wall
 they said we don't want you to build the wall
 walls don't work
 i said no no walls always work
 you know what else works
 the wheel
 the wheel and the wall you can go back
 come back in 1000 years from now
 the only two things i know for sure you're going to have a wheel and you're going to have a wall
 the computers they come up with a brand new computer it's genius 12 days later it's obsolete
 but walls are never obsolete neither are wheels
 so i made one mistake and i tell this to these guys because they were great warriors for me the congressmen
 they were incredible actually
 i tell it to them
 i should have said instead of we will build the wall we will build the wall we will build … then the democrats held us up and fought us and sued us and everything else and now we won so many lawsuits on the wall and we had the military money i can build like 10 walls with all the money we have
 it's the craziest thing
 maybe we'll build it double thick or we'll go twice as high
 no but the wall is great
 everything everything that they wanted but i made one mistake
 i should have said we will not build a wall
 then they would have insisted that we build it i could have saved two years of litigation
 we will not build a wall under any circumstances
 then pelosi would say we demand that you build a wall
 these people are terrible
 crazy nancy crazy as a bedbug
 she's crazy as a bedbug
 she decided to make a nice little stop-in at the beauty parlor how did that work out
 not too good it didn't work out too well
 can you imagine
 the owner of the beauty parlor is a maga lady she loves trump
 can you believe it
 i don't know what it is but i think if i owned a beauty parlor i had a customer i'm not sure i'd be turning her in
 the owner turned nancy in
 that's a lot of hate
 that's serious hate right
 no she's a great owner
 as far as i'm concerned i think she's fantastic
 she's for us
 they said what made you do it
 you know what she said because i see how hard our president has to work
 i see what they put him through
 i see what he puts with and i turned her in
 how about that
 how about that
 we love her
 she can do my hair anytime
 i think i'm going to call her in
 check it out maybe you can do something
 maybe you can improve it it's not bad though
 i have friends that … i have friends my age they're not looking too good
 instead of standing up for america joe biden and the democrats they condemn america and war is always waged on our great law enforcement
 we love our law enforcement
 kamala harris that's another great beauty kamala harris that's a beauty
 remember i tell this story all the time
 when you pick somebody you pick somebody that's hot that's going in the right direction right
 she came out she was at like 14 15 in the polls and she started going down down down it never stopped
 it drove her crazy
 she was terrible at the debates
 wait till you see what … i don't want to put pressure on him but wait till you see what mike pence does to her in the debates but i don't want to put … i don't want to put pressure on mike
 do we have a great vice president
 is he good
 he's great and he loves this state
 loves all the states actually
 he's just a great american but do you remember his last debate
 what he did to that character from virginia
 that one wasn't good
 the other guy's jumping around mike is just sitting there we love america we're going to lower your taxes
 thank you you win
 no mike is great
 but kamala harris and 13 members of biden's staff urged their supporters to donate to a fund to bail out rioters take them out of jail get them out of jail as soon as possible
 including one who attempted to murder a police officer a man who was accused of sexually assaulting an eight-year-old girl
 this is what we're dealing with
 this is what we're dealing with
 you know kamala was considered is considered further left than crazy bernie think of that
 they got there … i mean seriously watch
 you know the manifesto that biden and … it's not biden biden has not agreed to anything
 his people his representatives because biden doesn't know he's alive let's not kid ourselves
 biden
 biden didn't agree he didn't they just told him what's happening
 they said listen you're against fracking but now you have to be in favor of fracking because you lucked out
 elizabeth warren decided not to drop out and when she stayed pocahontas you know pocahontas
 did anybody ever hear of her
 she's another great one
 pocahontas
 i said to her a long time ago i've got more indian blood in me than you do and i have none i have none
 sadly
 i'd love a little bit of it but i have none i said … i turned out to be right
 she choked and she went for a blood test
 remember
 was it 1024th
 meaning maybe nine hundred years ago there was a little action going on
 crazy pocahontas she's a nasty one though isn't she
 she's a terrible person
 i was hoping that she'd win so we could go after her because i think kamala is not as smart but she's a little bit less vicious
 i think this
 the one who treated sleepy joe the worst was kamala
 she accused him of metoo she accused him of everything
 she accused him of … that he was a racist right
 that he was a racist
 because what he's done to the black population of this country was a terrible thing
 she's accused him of everything under the book the busing remember the busing scandal
 so i said brilliantly he'll never pick her because she was too terrible to him
 she was the worst of everybody
 by far i would say but she picked him and hopefully that's going to be history it's not going to matter and that is no way for a woman to become the first president that's for sure
 if a woman is going to become the first president of the united states it can't be her
 that would rip our country apart
 this is not what people want and she comes in through the backdoor this would not be what people want especially because it's her
 biden has called to end cash bail you know that right for vicious criminals
 meaning if you assault a copy or anybody else you're right back on the street the next day
 he called for police and he calls them all the time the enemy
 he says they're the enemy and he just thinks it's terrible
 he think it's terrible
 now he's liking the police much more
 it's a little late
 remember first instinct that's where they're going and he has no choice because he has to because again i was going to say the radical left hates him because they think he deceived them because they agreed on that manifesto and that manifesto is seriously a leftist dream and he agreed from the green new deal getting rid of your planes
 no more airplane trips
 remember the crazy senator from hawaii
 do you like the green new deal
 i love it very much he said
 oh okay well you're the senator from hawaii that's right the beautiful island of hawaii
 she said under the green new deal you basically can't fly in an airplane
 oh that's a problem
 so they said they'd build a bridge from the mainland to hawaii
 it's 2000 miles long but these are minor details
 remember her when they explained to her that planes are out cows are out
 cows they don't want cattle they don't want cows
 did they withdraw that one
 that was a tough one wasn't it
 they don't want cows bad for the ozone layer
 who would even think of that
 you'd got to be sick to even think it okay
 give me a break
 give me a break and i guess under that theory this big guy is next he's next
 no it's a sick deal going on there
 to do it the way they want would cost 100 trillion
 that's more money than this country could earn in 1000 years to do it right
  we don't like that building the windows are too large
 okay let's rip it down and build a new one
 what windows are you going to have
 you're not going to have windows anymore
 environmental
 they love wind too right
 the big windmills i always say the greatest graveyard in the world for birds just walk under a windmill
 you will see more dead birds than you will ever imagine what's happening including eagles
 you know in california they put you in jail if you shoot a bald eagle right
 you go to jail right
 these windmills are knocking them out of the sky all day long
 it's unbelievable and yet they want wind and wind also is very it's very hard to store the electricity from wind
 so if you go home and you want to watch television because president trump is on and you want to watch one of his very brilliant state of the union addresses if the wind isn't blowing the husband looks at the wife says darling i'm sorry you can't watch tonight
 the wind is not blowing
 sorry you can't watch tonight
 the wind is not blowing
 and she looks at me i like the old days
 it's much better
 but the rhetoric of biden and the radical left puts your law enforcement in serious danger
 last weekend two los angeles sheriff's deputies were ambushed and shot at point blank range
 and we have everybody looking for that creep that did it
 i called him an animal the other night
 i said he's an animal and we were challenged by some people on the left
 he's not an animal
 he's a human being
 he's not a human being
 they got to find him
 they got to find him
 and the penalty has to be very fast very swift and very very severe
 you can't do that
 we call for the death penalty if you kill a policeman
 you know that right
 but the anti police demonstrators they cheered and cheered when they saw this
 and then they tried to stop them from even getting into the hospital
 as president i'll always support the heroes of law enforcement and i'll fight to ensure that criminals who murder police officers do indeed get the death penalty
 they want prisoners to vote too they wanted to
 i said so what about the boston bomber
 remember bernie sanders
 he wanted all prisoners to have
 and i said does that mean everybody
 yes
 so we sent in a question does that include the boston bomber
 is he entitled to a vote
 and even bernie is going oh man let's get into a different question
 this is not a good question
 but we want to get that we want to take care of it
 if you look at all of the problems that we have you look at crime even somebody brought it up today we're doing a great job relative to other countries on the coronavirus
 you know how many names we have
 like 22 different names
 i call it the china virus
 we're doing a great job
 but if you want to really see a great job take new york and some of these other democrat run states out of it
 you'll see numbers that are unbelievable because new york had a very very hard time
 a lot of bad things happened
 but you take a few of the states out and you'll really see numbers
 but by comparison to other countries and by almost all metrics we've done an incredible job including the job of helping the world with ventilators and all of the things that we built
 and i think our task force has been incredible
 and mike pence has done a great job
 biden opposes the death penalty for cop killers or mass murderers
 biden says he wants to protect black lives but his radical platform will cut short the lives of thousands of african american citizens
 the democrat party's war on cops has already led to surging homicides in democrat controlled cities
 yet biden supports imposing these failed policies nationwide
 they ask him what about nationwide
 what about the fact that you just had your democrat national convention
 where by the way we had far many more viewers millions and millions of more viewers
 we had millions of more
 i thought it was a great thing
 did anybody hear herschel walker that night
 it was … well
 you talk about a good football player
 he was some player
 what a great guy
 but all of them everybody
 the first lady did great ivanka did great
 they all did they did great
 we had some … and some incredible stories some very sad stories when you look and see what happened
 but biden's plan is to appease the domestic terrorists
 my plan is to arrest the domestic terrorists
 joe biden is a weak person
 he's always been a weak person
 and that was in prime time
 and prime time was 25 years ago
 and let me tell you he's not old
 i always defend him on this
 i have friends that are 85 89 92 95 and they're 100
 there's just something wrong with joe
 he's off okay
 he's off and i have no problem saying it anymore when i watch the disinformation because this is not disinformation
 this is fact
 if he's elected his radical supporters won't just be causing mayhem on the streets they'll be running the department of justice department of homeland security the department of education
 and most importantly they will put many judges on the united states supreme court
 we can't have that
 we'll have a totally different country
 radical left judges
 and that has to do with the second amendment
 it has to do with right to life it has to do with so many different things that will turn your world upside down
 and they'll have one two three or four whoever is the next president
 and hopefully that's going to be us
 not me us
 it's us
 but i put it and think of this by the end of the term we'll have approximately 300 brand new great federal judges court of appeals judges 300 which is a record 300
 give or take a little tiny bit but 300
 nobody thought that was possible
 i want to thank president obama
 he left us 142 openings
 nobody gets left one opening
 a federal judgeship is a big deal
 nobody gets left any openings
 he gave us 142 openings
 thank you very much
 what happened
 they thought hillary was going to win so they didn't push it
 and then they said wait a minute these polls are getting a little close at the end
 and they tried like hell to get some judges approved but it didn't work
 that's what happens
 you got to go and you have to act fast
 you got to get it done
 get it done right
 we get things done like nobody's ever gotten it
 oh he was a great president
 he was great
 he left 142 judges for the republicans
 he was a great president right
 if you are of that side of the plate of that ideology and you had a president that left you 142 federal judgeships i don't think you'd rate him as doing a good job
 hey look at what happened in iraq look at what happened with isis look at what happened with our military look at what happened with our vets
 our vets are better taken care of now than they've ever been in the history of our country but never forget they are coming after me because i am fighting for you
 and that's true
 that's true
 and we're winning the fight and we're winning this election
 this election we are doing well
 they refuse to say it
 they refuse to say it and they hate to say it
 it just drives them crazy
 but that night remember they started off by saying this will be a very short evening for donald trump
 that was donald trump in those days
 now it's president trump
 i lost all my friends because of this position
 i had friends
 hey don let's go to dinner
 okay
 good richard
 i'll go
 hey don let's go
 okay larry
 i'll see you later
 i'll meet you at a restaurant in new york
 everybody was nice and loose
 you could have a great conversation and you don't want to know what we talked about
 it's just none of your business but we were loose
 all of a sudden i'd become president of the united states
 and these are a lot of … i know a lot of important people
 actually the people i like the best are the people that are less successful because it makes you feel so powerful
 i always say never go out with a successful person
 you'll understand
 but i know a lot of very successful people very very successful
 and now they call me up mr
 president sir would you like to get together sometime
 i say loosen up
 yes call me donald
 you've known me for 30 years call me donald
 oh thank you so much
 thank you mr
 president i appreciate it
 i lost all my friends because it's respect for the office let's face it
 it's different
 they used to be loose they used to be great
 you could sit back i'm not a drinker but you could sit back and have a drink whatever the hell you're drinking
 and now you can't do that anymore
 you can't do it anymore
 so i have to rely on people in congress to be my friends
 and we just happened to have a couple tonight
 and one of them who's been a great warrior and he's doing a fantastic job i just saw you on television by the way bryan
 does everybody know bryan steil
 bryan steil
 young handsome but a warrior
 when the fake impeachment happened it was a total fake what did we finish up with the republicans
 197 to nothing right at the house
 one night it was a fake impeachment
 i got impeached over a perfect phone call of congratulations to the president of ukraine who i never met before
 if you're going to do something at least know him a little bit right
 i never met him
 and then they said it was eight times quid pro quo
 that was adam schiff
 shifty schiff right
 and he went before congress and he repeated my conversation except that he made it all up
 remember he repeated it
 and then i said ah fortunately we had that whole thing essentially recorded
 i'm glad i did but these are very deceptive deceiving sick people
 and i said well he lied because there was no quid pro quo
 it was a perfect conversation
 but by that time it was too late because they had already embarrassed themselves by doing it
 and nancy pelosi was all set
 she loved doing it she from day one but she thought it was what schiff said
 when she saw the conversation she said to her people what the hell did you get me into
 so they could have dropped it but they said let's give it a shot
 he's another beauty mitt romney
 he's a real beauty
 he couldn't get elected dog catcher right now in utah
 so we have another great one and he's really a friend of mine and he's been solid
 he loves his country and he loves his state glenn grothman
 glenn thank you very much friend
 and a man who just got elected and he's from an area that i know very well we did very well we got our big big fat beautiful contract that produced lots of jobs
 but he was taking a legend's place so it's never easy to replace a legend
 that's duffy in case anybody … and they was running and we did a lot of work for him and it was great
 and he reacted very well under pressure
 a lot of people don't react well under pressure
 they choke they choke
 he was under a lot of pressure and he ended up winning by like 18 points
 and now he's your congressman
 he's doing a great job
 you got to vote for all these people on november 3rd tom tiffany
 thank you tom
 and we have a great congressional candidate derrick van orden
 where's derrick
 derrick good luck
 i hear good things derrick
 you got my total support
 i hear very good things
 i could only be supportive
 our record is like 222 and three so i don't like to have a loss
 and i support you a 100 you know that
 you have my total endorsement all right
 i hear you're fantastic
 all right
 and your former congressman who i hope is making a lot of money in the private sector because he deserves it especially his wife rachel deserves it she's just fantastic
 he's fantastic because i know he's coming back into government in some form
 he can come with us
 he can stay here
 he can maybe run for governor or maybe do something sean duffy
 sean duffy
 no but he was the world champion tree climber
 and i love sports right
 anytime you know the world champion at anything but especially that and i'll never forget
 i was asking about it
 how was it was
 he said well he broke his back numerous times
 he broke a lot of bones
 i said let me ask you a question
 how much harder was it to go up the tree than down
 he said it was easy going up
 the hard part was coming down because if he missed that was where the danger was right
 that was where the danger
 but many times world champion
 could you still do it today
 a little bit heavier he said
 you got to carry a little bit more weight
 that's all right
 that's not a good sign though right
 anyway great job
 we love having you rachel thank you very much
 you are a friend
 fox and friends and plenty of other places right
 a lot of personality a lot of personality
 rachel she's been our friend from day one i think from day one
 and her fantastic family too
 tonight we're also praying for everyone in the path of hurricane sally
 we're out there working very hard
 we are working in florida and alabama and georgia
 we have fema
 we have everybody there
 we just finished in … take a look we just went to louisiana texas
 we're getting hit by some big hurricanes but we have it under control
 really good
 our coast guard has been fantastic by the way
 unbelievable the bravery
 they go into these storms
 they go into these storms
 they say how dangerous is it
 sir it's very dangerous
 i say yeah
 all right
 he said would you like to try it sometime
 i say admiral no thank you
 i'll take a pass
 i think they might have a problem with me doing it but i will tell you they are … in texas they saved 16000 people two years ago the coast guard us coast guard
 i think there's no brand to me that's gone up more than the us coast guard
 so it's great that we're getting them new ships
 those ships are all coming in
 nice new ones all built in the usa beautiful ones
 most of them have already arrived
 my administration will be by their side through every step
 we're working again very very hard in the panhandle
 the panhandle we love the panhandle
 it got hit hard
 we spent the last four years reversing the horrible damage joe biden inflicted over the last 47 years
 we passed record tax cuts and regulation cuts
 nobody's ever done more more than anybody else has ever done to keep our family farms in the family
 we've virtually eliminated the unfair estate tax also known as the death tax
 so if you die in 100 years from now and you have children who you love as opposed to children that you can stand … is anybody here they have children that they don't like or perhaps can't stand
 because if you do don't listen to the rest of this
 but if you have a family that you love and you have a small business or farm or whatever they were being put out of business
 they'd have to go and borrow the money to pay the estate tax the death tax
 and it was a terrible thing
 we got rid of it so now you can leave your farm your small business to your family
 and just hope they remember you every once in a while
 it's always a difficult situation but it was
 it was ruining farms
 they'd have to go out and sell the farm they'd have to go out and get partnerships they'd have to go out and borrow money from banks
 and then all of a sudden they're in foreclosure proceedings and they've never done that before
 they don't have to worry about that anymore
 if you love your family that's a big deal
 they've been trying to get that sean for what 30 years they've been trying to get that right
 especially for the farmers because it's that kind of a business
 it's a great business but it's day to day
 you have a bad crop all of a sudden you can't pay interest on a loan to pay your state tax right
 and they lose their farm
 so we're not going to have that anymore
 we achieved american energy independence for the first time
 totally independent
 we don't have to be in those far away places unless we want to be
 biden pledged to abolish american oil american jail clean coal natural gas
 he said the fracking i told you that but we're not going to let him get away
 we'll be bringing that up on occasion
 for 47 years joe biden crushed the dreams of wisconsin workers and enriched foreign countries
 that's what happened
 before i got here what was happening with japan
 and we pay our deep respects to prime minister abe of japan a great friend of all of ours a great friend of mine
 he's going to be leaving office very soon like in a matter of a day
 and he was a great gentleman
 he's a tough negotiator i'll tell you that
 he made very good deals against the united states but he's somebody that's going to be missed
 he's a great gentleman
 he championed every special interest biden every special interest
 and he sold out on trade
 he sold out like almost nobody ever before
 earlier this year i kept my promise to american workers when we ended the nafta nightmare and signed the brand new us-mexico-canada agreement into law
 i saved the us auto industry by withdrawing from the last administration's job killing catastrophe the trans-pacific partnership
 you ever hear of that beauty
 that would have really hit you
 in 2017 i signed a historic executive order making government policy to buy american and hire american
 i'm watching this biden and he's got his sign in front buy american
 oh by american
 i've been saying that for like 20 years right
 where the hell has this guy been
 they were actually accusing him of plagiarism
 i also took the toughest ever action to stand up to china's rampant theft of wisconsin jobs
 and it's all jobs but you got hit particularly hard
 biden has vowed to remove those tariffs and allow china to resume its pillaging
 he wants to take the tariffs off that are paying us tens of billions of dollars a year
 i fought like hell to keep them into the china deal and he wants to remove them
 so tens of billions of dollars billions and billions i gave it to the farmers
 i gave it to a lot of people but i gave most of it by far to the us treasury
 he wants to take them off
 so let me just ask you just a very innocent question
 there's a young man about four years old up front i think he could give the answer
 who do you think would like to have china
 how do you think china would feel about this election
 in one case they paid billions and billions of dollars a month to the us
 we never got ever 25 cents from china
 in the other case he said we're going to take them off
 i think they might be inclined to go for sleepy joe
 this is like a dream for china
 joe biden's agenda is made in china
 my agenda is made in the usa
 it's very simple
 so we did many things
 not only china not only the 28 billion farmers
 we did so much and i'm proud to announce that i'm doing even more to support wisconsin farmers
 starting next week my administration is committing an additional you've been asking for this for a long time 13 billion in relief to help farmers recover from the china virus including wisconsin's incredible dairy cranberry and ginseng farmers who got hurt badly
 been after that money for a long time
 when the wisconsin timber industry was threatened i imposed tariffs on dumped foreign timber and subsidized products saving many many timber jobs in your state
 if joe biden gets in the radical left will shut down wisconsin's timber production for environmental reasons
 do you believe that
 oh boy
 it's so sad to see it and that would happen
 but we can't let that happen
 we've come too far
 we're so good
 if that virus hadn't hit us and it did and it hit the whole world but if it hadn't hit us we would have numbers the likes of which nobody thought were even remotely possible
 but it did and we saved a lot of lives
 they keep saying oh they just … by the way if we had two people die they would have said he did a terrible job
 if we had 100 people die if we had 1000 no matter what we do
 we have trade deals
 we announced a trade deal everybody is saying how great it is
 schumer and pelosi see it they have no idea what the deal is we don't like the deal
 did you look at it
 oh of course we looked at it
 it doesn't have tariffs
 oh no it does have tariffs
 they know nothing about the deal
 automatically anything we do they just take the reverse
 but you know what
 i'd probably do it to them too so i can't complain
 and perhaps no issue have our opponents more thoroughly betrayed working families of all backgrounds than on the subject of immigration
 under my administration we've achieved the most secure border in american history
 we ended the catch and release
 you know what catch and release is
 you catch up them they may be a killer they may be a criminal at the highest order you take their name
 then you're supposed to bring them to a court like perry mason right
 but we actually catch them take their name release them say come back in about four years for your court case
 we ended all this stuff
 and you think that was easy
 it wasn't easy let me tell you
 it was tough but we have a really good secure border
 and the president of mexico has been terrific
 we right now have 27000 soldiers from mexico guarding our border free of charge
 we stopped asylum fraud and we've deported 20000 gang members and over a half a million criminal illegal aliens of the worst kind
 we're enforcing the clear requirement that newcomers to our country must be financially self-sufficient and not reliant on welfare
 they have to sign a document
 we invested 2
 5 trillion in the us military including major contracts to build new warships that helped save the historic shipyard in marinette
 how about that
 i was there two months ago
 marinette
 that's a great company but it was having a hard time
 and now they're building what was that like 6 billion worth of ships
 and their beauties
 they've started already and we worked very hard on that
 and we had a lot of help from your congressman on that one because a lot of people wanted that contract
 but we got it for wisconsin remember that
 we launched the first new branch of the united states armed forces in nearly 75 years
 that's right the space force
 the fact is and somebody said it on the other side an opponent said whether you like it or not trump actually did more as president than he promised during the campaign
 like space force that's a big deal
 think of it
 army navy air force marine
 … think of it army navy air force marines coast guard right
 think of it
 i mean that's all you heard your whole life right
 the army the navy the air force the marines coast guard
 and now we have the space force
 you know what a big deal first time in 75 years it's a new one
 last one was 75 years ago
 the air force right
 that's a big thing
 i never talked about that on the campaign i never even thought about it
 when i became president i said we have to do this
 because i saw what russia was doing and i saw what china was doing
 and they've created their space forces i said what are we going to do
 not have it
 it's going to end up being maybe your most important or certainly one of your most important because that's where it's at in terms of defense in terms of offense
 we passed va choice and va accountability for our great veterans that we had the other day
 veterans satisfaction 91 percent the highest score we've ever received
 you haven't noticed remember years ago every story every night the nightly news you'd always have horrible stories about the va you don't see it anymore
 now i don't want to give them any ideas because they'll search all over the country for a vet who's unhappy
 i'm hurting myself by telling this story
 this is not a good story
 but remember that every night you'd have these horror stories about the va
 you don't see that anymore
 91 percent approval rating
 i kept my promise recognized the capital of israel and opened the american embassy in jerusalem
 i recognized israeli sovereignty over the golan heights and we achieve the first breakthrough in the middle east peace
 and you saw that two days ago uae bahrain israel nobody thought it was even possible
 i saw john kerry on television the other day
 it is not possible
 then we waited a little while
 he went very very strong it is not possible
 and it was not only possible we have many countries that are joining us very soon
 we killed the founder and the leader the vicious leader of isis al-baghdadi we killed him
 and we also took out the world's number one terrorist and the mass murder of american troops and many many troops and many people all over the world
 qasem soleimani is dead he's dead bad guy bad guy very bad guy
 we kept america out of new wars and we're bringing our troops back home
 no one has been more wrong more often than sleepy joe biden
 he voted for the iraq war he supported the defense sequester that gutted our military
 i took over a military that was totally depleted like
 hillary clinton deleted as opposed to depleted she depleted them too
 but she deleted 33000 emails
 when is somebody going to pull the spring
 ah come on fellows
 no that's terrible
 33000 emails
 try going to court sometime on a civil case and when you go before the judge he'll say did you delete those emails
 did you get rid of those texts
 did you this… right
 and now they caught weissmann and all these guys cleaning their phones because they were under investigation and they cleaned their phones
 how many were there
 21 but they were like 33 phones
 and yet look what they do to general flynn and some of these people that did nothing
 they cleaned their criminals yeah that's criminal it's criminal they're criminals
 they talk and talk and talk they're criminals
 they clean their phone so you don't have any of the information but that's a big problem for them i would imagine
 it's a disgrace that they can do it
 but hillary got rid of… she deleted and acid-wash right
 who acid-washed
 did you ever… and she also used to bang them with a hammer remember that we forgot that right
 so let's see what happens with all of that stuff
 i think bill barr's doing an excellent job i have to tell you
 and he's fighting a very bad establishment in washington
 there's some bad apples in that whole deal
 but if you think that biden opposed the mission to take out of osama bin laden he was against it
 he opposed the killing of soleimani
 he oversaw the rise of isis what a mistake
 and he cheered the rise of china as a very positive development for america and the world i don't think so
 i don't think so
 it's not been too positive
 if it were up to sleepy joe biden bin ladin and soleimani would be alive
 isis would still be on the rampage and china would now be the dominant power in the world and there not even close i will tell you
 we have weaponry the likes of which nobody's seen
 2
5 trillion buys you some good stuff especially when we have the finest scientific minds and military minds in the world
 we have weapons the likes of which nobody's seen and just hope to god we never have to use them
 i say that and i say it's strongly
 hope that we never have to use them
 my attitude was that and i've learned this a long time ago by having them we keep ourselves out of war as opposed to bringing ourselves in war
 but we have built and created weapons the likes of which this world has never seen before
 and we don't have to talk about it too much nor do i really want to talk about it
 when i ban travel from china biden called it hysterical and xenophobic he said he's xenophobic
 what does that mean
 joe tell me
 biden also opposed my plan to ban europe i saw what was happening in france and spain and italy and highly infected we banned europe
 if we had insisted and listened to joe and insisted on doing what so many other people said doing which is you don't have to do the ban
 hundreds of thousands of more americans would have died from the plague
 biden was willing to sacrifice american lives on the altar of open borders
 and now i hear him talking he should have followed me
 this guy did the swine flu right it was a catastrophe
 and the man that headed up the swine flu i won't use his name because i'd like to have him have a nice evening because i can't imagine the democrats are thrilled
 he said it was a horrible job we had no idea what we were doing it was a disaster
 he said it was a disaster
 and now biden's telling us how to do what we're doing so well on what other countries are calling me and congratulating me on the incredible job
 and i got sleepy joe biden trying to tell me how to do it
 and his own man who headed it up swine flu it's h1n1 swine flu
 joe called it n1h1
 i keep saying joe joe it's h1n1 right
 i said it's easier to remember because h comes before n but he can't do it
 and then you saw what he said the other day under a harris-biden administration
 that was a disaster
 i never said under a pence trump administration he said under a harris-biden administration
 and what made it worse is she said the same thing
 that was terrible right
 sean right
 did you hear that
 they are a disaster together
 through our historic relief programs we saved more than 1 million wisconsin jobs and 87000 wisconsin businesses that's not too bad
 and biden would demolish all of those games and we've done similar things in other states
 he would destroy your social security totally destroy it and destroy protections for preexisting conditions
 they want to go to social medicine they want to go to social… you know that right
 you do know that
 they want social healthcare where you don't… remember obama 28 times you can keep your doctor you can keep your plan that didn't work out too well right
 why haven't they looked into that one 28 times
 well under medicare for all but it's basically socialized healthcare you will never have your doctor you will never have your plan
 you'll have horrible healthcare
 you're going to wait long times long times
 and he wants to wipe out 180 million private healthcare plans that people love 180 million plans
 i don't think so
 i don't think he's going to make it
 how do you get elected
 let's say you're doing not only here let's say texas right he's against oil he's against god and he's against guns
 that's a tough combination in texas
 how does that apply
 now he's against religion
 they won't open these blue states they will not open your churches
 they won't open them
 and i think they have an ulterior motive
 one thing they have is probably everything opens on november 4th you understand that
 and they better be careful those paper ballots you talk about a bad thing just get out and vote get out and vote
 and if you have to go that route make sure they have it counted
 and they know it's trouble
 they just had another election today fellows where it's a disaster
 the votes come in they have no idea they can't count them
 and i don't mean they're off by a little bit they're off by 20 percent 25 percent
 there's fraud
 there's missing ballots
 they have a woman in new york who is a terrible congresswoman you know that
 carolyn maloney
 they gave her an election they can't even find the ballots
 and they gave her a victory and they cant find that the guy that is against her who did very well even though he's even more progressive i don't even know what she is
 i've known her for 25 years
 i don't think she's progressive
 i think she's whatever she has to be
 but this guy probably or possibly beat her
 so rightfully he's not too happy
 and they called the election for her and they can't find the ballots
 wants to force you to provide free healthcare to illegal aliens you remember he raised his hand that will totally drain your wonderful medicare
 remember the question up there he's standing up  who is willing to give free healthcare to illegal aliens
 and everybody raises their hands like fast
 kamala was right up there
 by the way that will destroy your country you do know that
 because you can't afford it and biden's looking around oh they all raise their hand
 he goes remember
 i remember
 i said well there it goes the election for him
 he's end our travel bans on jihadist regions and increase refugee admissions by over 700 percent
 and that's the deal he made with bernie sanders opening the flood gates to terror afflicted nations
 but i predict the sanders people are going to vote for us like they did the last time
 we had a tremendous…
 because they love my stance on trade because i know trade and i was telling him much more so than even bernie
 but bernie is right on that subject that other countries including our so-called allies are ripping us off on trade
 biden opposes school choice and vowed to ban charter schools
 did you know that
 does everybody like charter schools
 everybody likes choice
 in the second term i will provide school choice to every parent in america
 we're all set up to get it done
 a vote for republicans is a vote for safe communities great jobs and a limitless future for all americans
 it's really a vote for the american dream instead of letting washington change us
 and despite all that we've all gone through
 we are changing washington that's what's been happening
 and just in conclusion and i hate concluding with you because i like you
 i like you
 i don't know why the hell i like wisconsin but for some reason
 you know what helps so as you know for weeks before the election she was four up crooked hillary four up four up four up i kept saying do you think we're going to win
 and i will say sean duffy said you're going to win
 he actually said don't worry about it
 right sean
 i said sean do you think we're going to win here
 i don't like these polls but four down
 he said sir you're going to win so easy
 and early in the night they said donald trump has won the state of wisconsin
 and so when i'm here speaking in the freezing cold i'm lucky they had… i said do you think we have…
 it's very warm in new york and very warm in washington it was hot actually
 and i said do you think we have a coat on the plane
 they said yes
 i said what's the temperature
 sir it's 49 degrees
 i said how about giving me a coat
 they have everything on air force one that's the great thing
 got more televisions in any plane in history
 they've got televisions in closets on floors on ceiling
 but over the next four years we will make america into the manufacturing superpower of the world
 and we will end our reliance on china once and for all
 we'll make our medical supplies right here in the united states and right here in the great state of wisconsin
 we will rapidly return to full employment that's happening very fast soaring economies
 and the record prosperity will be even greater than it was last year
 we will hire more police increase penalties on assaults of law enforcement surge federal prosecutors into high crime communities
 and we will ban sanctuary cities which are deadly
 we will appoint prosecutors judges and justices who believe in enforcing the law not their own political agenda
 we will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race color religion and creed
 we will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life
 we will uphold religious liberty free speech and the right to keep and bear arms
 we will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep america out of endless foreign wars
 and you remember with me they thought because of my personality they said he'll be in war the first week
 what happened to the war
 remember we were going to be in war with north korea
 hillary would have been in war with north korea
 it would have been a nasty one too
 but remember everybody said i was going to be in war
 everybody said oh maybe i'll do something with social security
 and i did
 i saved it and made it stronger
 and now i'm going to make it even stronger
 and they're going to get rid of your social security because everything's going to come collapsing down
 you will have a depression
 if he gets in they're going to raise interest rates
 they're going to raise your taxes you will have a depression
 the likes of which this country has never seen before
 and your 401k's and your stocks and jobs will go down in flames
 i just say it here hopefully we're never going to experience it but that's what's going to happen
 we will maintain america's unrivaled military might and we will ensure peace through strength
 we will end surprise medical billing require price transparency which i've already signed
 further reduced health insurance premiums or the costs of prescription drugs which are coming down now
 you know i signed favored nations clauses their drug companies are not happy with me i will tell you
 they never thought it was possible and rebate clauses
 they never thought anybody would do that to them
 they made enough money for a long time
 it's time you got a big break
 we will strongly protect medicare and social security
 and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions always you have a pledge
 we will land the first woman on the moon and the united states will be the first nation to land an astronaut on mars
 and nasa is now the hottest space center anywhere in the world
 and when i took over three and a half years ago there was grass growing in the runways you know that it was closed down it was a mess
 we are now the hottest in the world
 you see what's going up
 and we've got a lot of rich guys sending them up too
 i liked that better
 i said let them do it
 rich guys like rockets i don't know they like rocket boom
 i see dollars going right up but they need a good place to launch
 we have the best places
 we have the best places so it's been incredible what we've done with nasa
 we will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools
 we're already there again
 we will teach our children to love our country honor our history and always respect our great american flag
 and we will live by the timeless works of our national motto in god we trust
