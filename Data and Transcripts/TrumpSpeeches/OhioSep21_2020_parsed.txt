wow that's a big crowd
 this is a big crowd
 thank you very much everybody
 hello to swanton and a load to toledo
 i'm thrilled to be back in ohio with thousands of hardworking loyal great american patriots … days from now
 can you believe it 43 days
 we go to again win ohio
 i understand from bob paduchik you know bob
 that we're going to win it by more than we did
 whether we win at nine we won by nine points
 i just came into that big beautiful place
 it's got more televisions in any plane in history
 they've got televisions and closets and bathrooms on the floor on the ceilings
 i just saw that we're tied in ohio
 i don't think so … president trump may have a slim lead in ohio
 they're not even campaigning in ohio come to think of it
 now they're fake polls
 they're almost as fake as the writers themselves
 they're all fake
 remember last time they said no he's going to lose ohio
 we won by nine points
 so we had seven swing states last time
 president trump is going to go home early but it wasn't president at that time it was just donald trump
 he will go home early
 we did
 that we went home early as victors but we had nine states
 they had one of the crazy papers new york times
 they hired that guy
 they paid him millions because he never predicted wrong
 he was wrong
 i don't know if they had a contract where they could fire him but they hired this guy
 we had nine states
 i was down at all of them on the day of election
 i was going to lose all nine and then guess what
 i won every one of them
 fake polls
 they're fake polls
 then we have a crowd like this
 i don't know
 look the cameras are you turning around
 these guys are bad people
 i swear
 they never turn the cameras around ever
 turn them around
 turn them around
 they never tell look at them
 it's just like a bunch of stiffs
 real stiffs
 why don't you turn the cameras around for once
 you look back there you can't see it
 there's got to be feels like madison square garden on the ground except we have more people
 oh boy it's always tough
 you know we go through this all the time
 we're always asking them look at these crowds
 i mean as far you can't see it
 you have this prime territory like you should be in the real estate business
 now as far as the eye can see back there the cameras don't they don't get it
 you only hear it from the sound
 i go home
 i say to the first lady did you see that crowd we had tonight in ohio
 she goes no no
 they just keep it on your face
 that includes fox
 they just keep it here right here
 they don't want to show
 you know what they don't know and what they don't get is that showing this kind of activity is a good thing for them
 it's positive for their ratings
 it's really a good thing but they don't want to do it but i give up on it
 you know what you do
 you hear it because you can't have … you know when sleepy joe biden he's got the circles
 you knowthose big circles
 you know why he has the circles
 he's got four of them because they can't … i mean think of it
 he is a guy who's failed every time he ran
 we called him 1 joe and now he's shot and he got their nomination
 how the hell does that work out
 how does that work out
 but he's got the circles
 he got like four sometimes he has six because that's a good way of saying if you don't have any people just put them in the circle and he's practicing the science
 now it doesn't work out but we're going to win four more years in the white house
 we're doing things that nobody's ever done before
 we're doing what nobody's ever done and thank you for being here
 i wish we could move the press back further if you want to know the truth
 as our nation mourns the loss of supreme court justice … thank you everybody
 thank you
 so is our nation mourns the loss of supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg i will soon announce a nominee for the united states supreme court
 they say it's the most important thing a president can do
 i don't know
 i think military maybe
 we rebuilt your military two and a half trillion dollars
 great
 we will fill that seat
 it's going to go quickly
 probably announced the person
 i don't want to make the men too angry
 it will be a woman
 is that okay
 i don't want to have a problem with men
 they'll say trump is doing very poorly with men
 you listen
 how's he doing
 well he's doing very poorly with men with women
 he's doing very poorly with the black community hispanic community
 then you have the election night doing very poorly with those with diploma without diploma college phds
 what's he doing well
 oh no it's going to be a very short night
 then they say donald trump is the projected winner by a lot
 they say well what happened is he did very well with women did very well with men diplomas
 he did well with african american community
 by the way we are doing really well with the african american community with the hispanic community
 we're doing well with women
 we're doing very well
 we're doing well with suburbia suburbia
 i ended a regulation that will destroy suburbia
 if biden got in they will destroy the suburbia
 we call it suburbia of the world and we love it
 i know it well westchester county the suburban they sometimes if you say suburban housewife you're in deep trouble
 so what you do is you say suburban women they love me
 you know why
 they want security and they don't want projects being right next to their house
 that's okay
 they don't want it
 by the way that includes minorities
 because 29 to 30 of these suburban communities are minorities
 that includes them
 they don't want that
 they want safe communities
 they want great communities
 they don't want to lose the american dream
 it's very simple
 i got rid of the regulation from obama- biden that was destroying suburbia
 okay
 destroying it
 i think suburbia has got to wake up because if they get in you know who's in charge
 you know who's in charge of the program
 cory booker cory booker
 cory booker
 so i think the suburban women and suburban men and husbands and wives and everybody you better get smart because you're not going to have your dream very much longer if they get in
 if i get in you've got it
 you've also got your second amendment if i get it
 in 2018 we expanded the senate majority
 remember they said first of all i wasn't running
 i wasn't running
 it makes a difference
 wait you see what happens
 we're going to take back the house
 we're going to get rid of this crazy nancy pelosi
 kevin mccarthy's done a great job
 we're going to take back the house
 people are so tired of her
 people are so tired
 did you hear today
 the latest
 so they impeached me for perfect phone call
 perfect
 it was a perfect phone call
 now they want to impeach me again if i nominate somebody as i'm constitutionally obligated to do to serve on the supreme court of the united states
 go ahead and i want them to do that
 i want them to do that
 we will
 we will
 we will
 if he puts forth a highly qualified candidate we will impeach him
 well i said well i'm the only guy in the world that could get impeached for trying to fill a seat in the supreme
 so we're going to put up our nominee who's going to be outstanding
 we're looking at five incredible jurists five incredible people women that are extraordinary in every way
 i mean honestly it could be anyone
 i mean we're going to be announcing it on friday or saturday
 again they say it's the most important thing and think of it
 so in a single term single term by the end of our term we will have nominated and had confirmed i think it'll end up being over 300 federal judges and hopefully three supreme court justices
 think of that
 three
 some presidents they never get any
 they last a long time a lot of presidents get none
 we've had three
 it's blowing their minds
 it's blowing their minds but for the people of ohio this is what you want
 so it looks like we're going to have three and it's going to be very exciting
 it's exciting even from me
 i'm going to look forward to it
 probably saturday we will announce the nominee and it's somebody that you're going to have great respect for great respect
 thank you
 big stuff
 that's a big thing
 they set the course of our country for many years to come whether it's on life or the second amendment or so many other things they set the whole course of the country
 very important position the most important
 joe biden has refused to list the names of his potential justices because he knows they're too extreme to withstand any form of public review
 if joe biden and the democrats take power they will pack the supreme court with far left radicals who will unilaterally transform american society far beyond recognition
 they will mutilate the largest figure the constitution and oppose a socialist vision from the bench that could never pass at the ballot box
 so they don't want to show the judges because the only ones that he can put in are far left radicals
 if he does something even towards left of center which would be acceptable i guess we have no choice
 if he did that he would lose the left
 so he's going to have to put in radicals
 so he doesn't want to show who his judges are
 i've shown a list i have a double list about 45 from which i will only pick but he doesn't want to do that because if you found out who he was going to pick he would be unelectable
 hopefully he's going to be unelectable anyway
 we're going to find out
 so he wouldn't be able to survive a joe biden
 you wouldn't be able to survive
 we've been calling it socialism
 i don't think it's socialism
 i think it's a step beyond what they're talking about
 you look at portland you look at chicago you look at new york you look at baltimore and oakland
 these are democrat run cities that are horrible in crime
 there's no law and order no cash bail no anything
 you know what
 the republican cities are running great
 they're running great
 so we're going to get it all changed around
 we went into minneapolis we solved the problem like you wouldn't believe
 what did it take
 you saw it
 what did that take
 i would say probably 30 minutes
 right
 they should have called us in about seven days earlier
 how about the reporter
 he gets up there behind him is a burning city
 i never saw anything like it
 he's saying there are really no protests here
 this is very friendly
 we call this a friendly protester because you're not supposed to have political rallies
 you're not supposed to have anything
 the only thing you can have is thousands of people running down a street burning stores looting doing what … that's okay because that's protesting but we'll call this a friendly protest but your children will be robbed of their future and the damage will endure for generations to come- … future the damage we'll endure for generations to come
 we have to win
 this is the most important election in the history of our country in my opinion
 and a lot of that's got to do with the fact that we're going to have one extra but we didn't think this was going to happen
 but i used to say just a week ago we're going to have one two three four and maybe even five the next president and the supreme court is going to be a tremendous factor
 a lot of people said that's the reason i won so easily in the electoral college last time
 306 306 to 223
 he will not get to 270
 remember
 he will not get to 270
 this will be a short evening for donald trump
 oh good riddance
 thank god we got rid of him
 oh this is going to be great
 and then that problem happened
 ladies and gentlemen donald trump has won the state of ohio
 remember the one she was crying
 she was crying
 donald trump has won ohio
 but it wasn't winning ohio it was by the margin
 where the hell
 he said where did this margin come from
 they opened the polls
 then they closed the polls
 normally you have to wait hours unless it's a total runaway
 and they said ah the polls and the doors are closed in ohio
 donald trump has won
 and they go oh my god
 but wait a minute
 he won by nine points
 what the hell's going on over here
 then they said donald trump has won the state of florida
 donald trump has won the state of georgia
 donald trump has won north carolina south carolina
 remember that
 was that the most exciting evening really
 remember
 and it's not donald trump
 it's you
 it's all of us
 they use the name donald trump
 it's all of us have won
 and this one's going to be even better because nobody has done and then don't even challenge it the fake news nobody has done in three and a half years what we've done
 we've rebuilt our military
 two and a half trillion dollars
 we've taken care of our vets
 we have choice we have accountability
 we can fire people now when they're not treating our vets right
 we couldn't do that before
 they could treat our vets terribly
 we have accountability
 nobody has done what we've done for our vets
 91 approval rating at the va
 91 the highest ever
 so nobody's done it and that's why i think this is going to be the most important of all
 i used to say well i don't know
 how does it compare to 2016
 i just gave that up
 this is the most important election
 you know why
 two reasons
 number one that's over with the hell with it
 the hell with it
 but the truth is it's got a seat in and we have a lot of new things including additional substantial middle income tax cuts and other tax cuts and tremendous regulation cuts
 and we're finishing up with our military
 we're building space force
 the wall is going incredibly
 you remember the wall
 they don't talk about the wall anymore the fake news
 once we started building it if you think that was easy to build the wall we had an entire party that would die for the fact and i made a terrible mistake in the wall instead of telling you we're going to build a wall we're going to build a wall the democrats formed it was very tough but i got it
 i'm a real estate developer
 you can always get money
 you learn we have a lot of little pockets
 we had a lot of big pockets
 but the military was great
 the army corps of engineers were great
 so we're up to 330 miles of wall
 we're doing 10 miles a week and we're going to be finished with the wall very soon
 and it's exactly the wall the little more expensive wall they want like nice expensive but exactly what border patrol wanted
 we're building them the exact wall that they want
 we can't give them any excuses
 we can't give them any excuses
 but it's true they used to talk about the wall all the time because they never thought i'd be able to get a bill
 once i got it going got it built i got the financing we won a lot of lawsuits by the way we won a lot of lawsuits
 they sued us
 pelosi was suing us
 congress was suing us
 the senate was suing us
 we won a lot of lawsuits
 once it was obvious that we won and we started building they never talk about the wall anymore
 and i made a terrible terrible mistake because i had to work my ass off to get that thing built
 you have no idea
 you have no idea
 you have no idea
 but i should have said the mistake i should have said when i talked to these big crowds and the crowds are getting bigger there's more enthusiasm now than we ever had four years ago but i should have said instead of we will build a wall i kept we will build a wall place would go crazy i should have said we will not build the wall
 under no circumstances will we build a wall the democrats would have given us all the money we wanted
 it's true
 it's true
 and then they would have said see he didn't keep his campaign promise
 these people are sick
 the biden nominated justices will shred our second amendment eliminate the right to self defense and allow the government to confiscate your privately owned firearms
 you know that
 put in other language they will end your second amendment
 and they will do that
 by the way if i wasn't here you wouldn't have a second amendment right now
 that would be gone
 i hate to say it
 i'm the only thing standing between you and chaos i'm telling you
 and second amendment and all of the other things
 biden's justices will remove the words under god from the pledge of allegiance
 did you see that
 did you see it
 they said no we'd never remove
 and i saw it they're doing the pledge of allegiance
 and i said oh it must be a typo
 they left the words under god out of the pledge of allegiance the democrats
 and i said oh there's a typo
 typo they made a mistake
 what a stupid mistake
 can you believe it
 that guy's in big trouble
 what a stupid mistake
 and then i heard it a second time
 they did the same mistake
 that's what they're doing
 they're going to take god out of everything just like they want to knock down the statue of george washington abraham lincoln thomas jefferson
 that's never happening
 it's never happening
 a lot of these democrats states you see it the churches are closed
 they don't want our churches to open
 you can have a riot where you kill people in the streets
 25000 people don't have to wear a mask nothing
 they can march down the streets step on each other's face they can do whatever the hell they want that's okay
 but you can't go to church
 they have ideas they have plans and it's never happening with me as your president
 that i can tell you
 and you see it they want to tear down crosses from public spaces
 you see it
 since i signed a little law they were ripping down a lot of statues about four months ago and i said do we have any laws like old laws when they was strong when we were smart when we were tough
 sir we have one sir
 a general came in
 what's the law general
 sir there was a law from quite a while ago 10 years in prison
 they didn't use the word jail prison
 prison's a tougher word
 i said what do you mean 10 years
 you get 10 years in prison if you knock down a statue or if you knock down a monument
 i said general let me see that sucker please
 bring that to my office
 and we revived it because you can't get that approved by congress
 they would never
 today in congress you'd do it they'll give you half a day in a hotel someplace
 so 10 years
 so they were having a big march on washington in two days and i signed this new law
 we updated it and it was 10 years
 you get 10 years in prison
 you touch you knock down a monument
 and there's no games
 this is the old days
 this is the days when we had strong laws when we had real laws when we had real politicians that knew how to make laws
 so here's the thing
 so they weren't going to come in they were actually looking to knock down the statue of a man named thomas jefferson
 that's not too good
 they had obliterated a lot of different things
 and so i had a news conference
 i announced that i'm signing a law that anybody that knocks down a monument or a statue gets 10 years in jail
 and the police in washington and we had national guard we had secret service
 we were all ready for them
 we were ready for them
 and the time came there's was only a problem nobody showed up
 you know why
 10 years was too much
 10 years was too much
 it's amazing the way
 isn't it amazing the way it all works
 so instead they burned down portland
 i speak to the governor
 the mayor is hopeless
 he's a hopeless poor guy
 they chased him out of his apartment and he still thinks they're wonderful people
 they're burning down his city
 but i want to go in there with the national guard so bad
 it would take us 15 minutes to solve the problem
 when they heard in seattle that we were going in we were going in the next day the guys just walked away
 they left
 that was the end of it
 we had nothing to do
 but they want to ban all prayer in public schools and require taxpayers to fund extreme late term abortion
 biden's justices will erase national borders they don't want borders protect sanctuary cities and compel the unlimited entry of foreign nationals
 and if you look at some of these jihadist nations no thank you
 somebody said that's not nice
 that's not politically correct
 i said that's okay
 they'll clip all the police departments free violent criminals shield foreign terrorists and declare the death penalty unconstitutional even for the most depraved mass murderers who kill women and children
 that's what they want
 they don't want any death penalty
 not for the boston bomber not for anybody
 you see the boston bomber they're still trying this guy what he did to so many lives
 he killed people ruined so many families ruined so many lives
 and by the way they want the boston bomber to be able to vote
 you know that
 in three and a half years under my administration we've secured america's borders rebuilt the awesome power of the united states military obliterated the isis caliphate 100 fixed our disastrous trade deals and brought jobs and factories back to the great state of ohio
 i love ohio
 i love ohio
 i don't know what it is
 i was told by bob and some of the congressmen that are here we have some great ones i'm going to introduce them in a second but i was told that they're not even trying for ohio
 you know why
 because i love you and you love me and that's the way it is
 that's the way it is
 thank you
 i love you too
 it's very interesting
 so somebody in the fake news media did a story yesterday because there's crazy chances going on
 they have too about the seat and all that
 but there was another chant that's happening at all these rallies
 we're having massive rallies
 we're in minnesota
 we had a tremendous crowd
 wisconsin tremendous
 pennsylvania every one of them
 i mean in all fairness it's like this everyone
 but this rant is going on like it's crazy
 and it's we love you
 we love you
 we love you and you know what
 i don't want to say it
 i'm just saying they have not been able to find in the history of politics in this nation even we loved ronald reagan but they have not been able to find where people broke out and said we love you about i guess i have to call myself a politician
 i don't feel like a politician
 how nice is that
 i never heard it
 i've been to a lot of different speeches and rallies
 i've never heard crowds go we love you
 but you know why
 we love you
 i love you
 but you know why
 because again nobody has done what we've done
 ohio had the best year in its history last year
 we had a great year
 and next year assuming we win which i hope we're going to win but if we win you're going to have a year next year
 first of all take a look at the third quarter
 it's going to be announced the numbers just before the election
 they'll come out three days before the election
 and i'll tell you what i'll bet on the numbers even though crazy nancy and these people don't want to give any stimulus they don't want to give anything
 they want to keep a lot of states closed wherever they can
 you know what they're going to do
 they're going to announce they're going to be opening on november 4th
 there'll be open
 all these closed states they're going to be open on november 4th
 one of them blue and a teacher's union
 did you see it
 no we don't want to open now
 we don't want to open
 the pandemic
 we don't want to
 we're rounding the turn on the pandemic
 vaccines are coming soon
 but we don't want to open
 around november 4th we're going to open
 this person that's a judge of a union said that
 that was not good
 i think they'll get rid of her quickly
 i'm also proud that we have successfully brought back the big 10 and the ohio state buckeyes
 you better have a good year after all of that
 you have a good team right
 good coach
 good team
 good everything
 you have a good team
 you always have a good team
 but there was a case what do i know
 i said how's it going
 everything good
 are you struggling
 they said sir sleepy joe biden did an ad that you me that you closed football
 i said what do you mean i closed
 i didn't close
 the guy did an ad
 it's called disinformation
 it's called the opposite of what the fact is
 not only didn't i close it i didn't think about it too much okay
 the states should all be open
 but i heard about big 10 football and because of this ad i said hey wait a minute
 i have an idea
 it was a fake ad just like the ad on the grave sites and that allows me to say that this man is a gross incompetent
 he has no idea
 because now see i would never talk like that but when i saw that horrible thing and nobody's done more for the military than i have when i saw that horrible ad an anonymous source has said that donald trump said this i have 28 people now that have come forward saying it's a total lie they don't care so they did an ad once they did that i said well now the gloves are off
 let's face it joe biden is incompetent
 he always was even in prime time
 he was incompetent in prime time
 and now he's really incompetent
 but because of the ad i said it's very interesting that ad it's very interesting
 let me call up the commissioner
 i had called up the commissioner very good guy and i said commissioner what can we do to get big 10 football back
 well i don't know
 and we started a little thing the commissioner and myself one of my guys he's fantastic and within a few days it started getting talked about and then we kept it going and we helped him with some testing because we have the greatest testing in the world
 we get no credit for it
 we've tested almost 100 million people
 india is second with 38th and they have 1
5 billion people slightly more than you
 but i will tell you so all of a sudden they have schools
 then looked like it was going to open without michigan and without a couple of states
 and then all of a sudden the pressure became so great and the full league is opening now and it's going to be very exciting
 and i will tell you it's not a question of taking credit but truly we were the ones that did that
 i mean it was
 i'll tell you when i do it and when i don't
 but it was closed it was gone it was announced that it was closed
 and what really spurred me on was when sleepy joe announced that i was the one that did it
 i said i didn't even know it was closed
 but once i found out it was i called the commissioner
 he was really good i tell you
 and we called a couple of the top people at the universities and they got it going
 it looked like we had seven schools eight schools
 all of a sudden everybody fell into line
 i think they're all open now
 every one of them is participating
 so i want to thank the commissioner
 i want to thank all of those schools
 may the best team win
 in other words ohio state
 that's a good team
 you know who the best proponents were
 the players and especially the parents of the players
 these kids have a short window to get into the nfl to create some excitement and how good they are
 and you have a lot of potential players but they couldn't play football
 and they said we're safer on the field than we are staying at home and they meant it
 and we did something and i'm happy about it
 so enjoy the football enjoy it
 under 16 years of presidents obama and bush median household income rose only 2945
 so remember that
 that's 16 years 2009 so let's say 3000
 under three years of president trump it rose almost 7000
 so think of that 16 years
 three years achieving the highest median income in the history of our country
 in my first three years we lifted 6
6 million people out of poverty the largest poverty reduction of any president in the history of our country
 we built the greatest economy in the history of the world and we are doing it again
 we're building it again
 i see the signs make america great again so i say this it's called now make america great again
 again
 because we did it and then we had to close it up
 we saved millions of lives
 if we didn't do that you would have had three million people
 it would have been terrible
 it's terrible anyway
 they shouldn't have allowed it to happen china
 to defeat the china virus we launched the largest mobilization since world war two
 through pioneering therapies we reduced the fatality rate- through pioneering therapies we reduced the fatality rate 85 since april
 think of that
 that's remdesivir and all of the things the plasma all different things
 where do you see what's coming out
 europe is almost 30 greater excess mortality rate than the united states
 that's before today's big breakout
 you know they had a big breakout in europe and they keep saying in the fake news they keep saying about oh europe europe europe
 well we're doing better than europe
 i hate to see what happened and it had a big impact on the market today because it was a bad thing
 but they had a big hit and they'll take care of it
 they know how to do it
 they'll take care of it
 we're working very closely with europe and other countries including on the vaccine
 we have three vaccines right now that are right there
 they're right at the starting gate and they're going to be fantastic
 so it's good
 with biden if you had that regime you'd be three years away because it would have never gotten out of the fda
 what we've done in a very safe manner is amazing
 now remember this biden was in charge of the swine flu right
 it's called the h1n1
 remember he calls it the n1h1
 i said no no no no
 h comes before the n
 it's so easy
 but he goes the n1h1
 we say no
 but it's the swine flu
 maybe we just call it the swine flu
 he did such a gross horrible job on that
 his own man who was in charge of it said they didn't have a clue
 they didn't know what they were doing
 it was a much less lethal disease and they lost many many people
 many many people
 it was totally incompetently
 and now i got this guy standing up
 well we're giving him advice
 his own guy that ran it
 did everybody see this
 they're saying they didn't have a clue what they were doing
 it was so bad
 i don't know why the hell he said it to be honest with you
 who would say that
 maybe because he was honest
 does that make sense
 now biden gets up and he's saying to do the same things as we've already done
 he basically took our plan and he said this is what you should do
 but we have among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country in the world and the fastest economic recovery by far of any western nation by far
 our bold and early action saved millions of lives and our decisive economic response saved tens of millions of jobs including 1
9 million jobs in the state of ohio
 you know that
 he knows it
 he's got one of them
 he's got one of them
 through operation warp speed we're developing these great vaccines
 and that's going to be… literally these will be done in record time
 like nobody's ever done it before
 on november 3rd ohio will decide whether we end the pandemic and return to record prosperity or whether we allow sleepy joe biden and his group of incompetence to delay the vaccine shut down the country
 he actually suggested that he would shut down the country
 we now know the disease
 we didn't know it
 now we know it affects elderly people with heart problems and other problems
 if they have other problems that's what it really affects
 that's it
 you know in some states thousands of people nobody young below the age of 18 like nobody
 they have a strong immune system
 who knows
 take your hat off to the young because they have a hell of an immune system but it affects virtually nobody
 it's an amazing thing
 by the way open your schools
 everybody open your schools
 sleepy joe biden wants to impose a 4 trillion tax site ban american energy destroy the suburbs give free healthcare to illegal aliens
 how about that one
 you know the bad part about that
 we all have heart
 we want to take care of people
 probably that is everybody's going to come to the united states
 people that weren't even thinking about it they're going to say oh man these idiots are giving free healthcare free college education
 they're giving free everything
 they're giving a rolls royce to every family that enters through the southern border
 remember i said that jokingly and cnn said he misrepresented
 they are not getting a rolls royce
 i agree
 now they're sick
 they are sick
 and indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-american lies
 they're doing that
 we're stopping it
 to combat the toxic left-wing propaganda in our schools i announced last week that we're launching a pro-american lesson plan for students called 1776 commission
 we will teach our children the truth about america that we are the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth and we are getting better and better all the time
 we got to
 no party can lead america that will not teach our children to love america
 biden's running mate kamilla
 who likes kamilla
 does anybody like her
 she was the most failed candidate
 i mean she started off good
 and every week she went down down 15 points 12 points 11 points 9 points six points five points four points two points
 didn't she leave at about two or one
 she was heading down to the basement
 she was so mean to him
 i felt sorry for him
 no i did
 i felt sorry
 so she called them everything from a racist to a metooer
 he was metoo
 he was a part of the metoo generation
 what she called him what she said
 so i brilliantly said well he can't pick pocahontas because she was too nasty
 how nasty was she to bloomberg
 was she unbelievable
 boy he was standing there
 what happened
 what happened
 no actually
 what happened
 mini mike
 he's another beauty
 he's a real beauty
 mini mike what happened
 what the hell happened
 he hit her so hard
 remember
 she hits him with about 30 different things and i'm not talking about our president
 he thought she was talking about me
 can you believe it
 and i'm not talking
 i'm talking about you
 he said get me out of here
 get me out of here
 and now he wants to buy his way back into the democrat party
 he wants to buy his way back into the democrats
 he hasn't taken enough abuse
 if i were him i'd sort of either ride it out or stay with the good trump economy and get even richer
 biden's running made even urged supporters to help the bail riders out of jail
 you saw that
 including one who attempted to murder a police officer and a man accused of sexually assaulting an eight year old child
 now they're trying to free them on bail
 they're putting up the money to get them out by this plan to appease the domestic terrorist
 and that's what it is
 my plan is to arrest the domestic terrorist and that's what we're doing for many people in jail
 many people
 remember what i told you about the monuments
 this is remembrance
 isn't it beautiful
 we don't see that anymore
 have you seen a monument knocked down recently
 no we don't see it anymore
 i don't know
 we want to rip down abraham lincoln
 it got to lincoln
 first it was not too many people heard of him
 confederate soldiers et cetera
 you say hey look do it through a process
 but they started hitting lincoln
 then they hit gandhi
 now gandhi was about peace
 gandhi just wanted peace
 leave me alone
 peace peace peace
 let's rip them down
 they're sick people
 the democrat party's war on cops has already led to a surge in vicious murders in democrat control cities costing countless black lives
 if biden and the left gain power they will dismantle police departments nationwide
 i'll tell you the community that's most hurt most hurt by what they're doing and there is the black community the hispanic community
 and we're doing great in the polls with the black community and the hispanic community
 and the asian community
 we're doing great
 in fact we did so well last night on one poll they said it must be a typo
 they did
 it must be an error
 it wasn't
 it's no error
 you're going to find out on november 3rd it's no error
 as president i always stand and i will always stand with the men and women of law enforcement
 they're great people
 they're very brave people
 not easy and they don't get support
 we have to give them back their dignity
 we have to let them do their job
 that's very simple
 they're great

 a friend of mine that i'll tell you this is the greatest optimist
 when i thought we had to be down we lost a lot of the top top support
 the head of the republican party little things like that
 i said we don't have a head of the republican party
 he left because you had a terrible governor in this state
 terrible
 your previous governor was terrible
 he was terrible
 i'll tell you i got this man
 i didn't know him
 within about a week i said man this guy's a big optimist
 and he was right
 he called it right to the thing
 he ran my campaign
 when he came back for the second time we had him in a high position
 i said bob i think you're great
 you're doing a great job
 i want you back in ohio
 we have to do it again
 bob paduchik
 where's bob
 thank you
 thank you bob
 get over here bob
 thank you bob
 he wants no glamor
 he wants no glory
 he just wants to win
 he called it right down to the bone
 we had a rough couple of days
 i said bob how we doing
 you went up two points
 i said you got to be kidding
 but we did
 so much evolves around ohio and it's just a state that we have a relationship with
 it's a great state
 we've done a great job for you and you've done a great job for us
 so we appreciate it very much
 thank you
 together we've spent the last four years reversing the damage done by the democrats and joe biden over a 47 year period
 think of it
 he's always talking about you should have done this
 you should have done that
 he really just left office
 it's not that long ago right
 he's been there for years and years and now he should have done
 he's never going to do anything
 he's never going to do anything
 guy is a stone cold loser
 biden supported every globalist sellout of ohio workers for over a half a century including nafta china's entry into the world trade organization the disaster known as tpp and how about the paris climate accord
 that's another beauty
 i'll tell you that was designed to hurt our country
 you would have lost trillions of dollars closed your factories all over the place
 in the meantime china didn't kick in for another 10 years
 the whole thing was a rigged deal
 i tell you i said i'm going to get killed for this one but we're going to terminate
 and you know what
 the people got it right away
 everybody understood
 that was another rip off of our country
 this state lost one in three manufacturing jobs after the nafta and china disasters
 joe biden is a shameless phony who pretends… he doesn't have a clue
 what the hell
 we're talking like he knows
 he's got guys around him that are pretty smart
 they're radical left
 he's going to do whatever they tell him to do
 he pretends to care about blue collar workers
 after spending more than five decades in washington he tells me why didn't you do this
 why didn't you do that
 you see these fake commercials
 why didn't you do it
 i said i've only been here three and a half years
 this guy has been here for 47 years
 he didn't do anything
 my actions saved countless jobs across ohio and here in toledo the home of the jeep right
 the home of the jeep
 that's good
 that's a great brand
 they've done a great job with jeep
 jeep
 everyone loves jeep
 earlier this year i kept my promise to ohio when we ended the nafta nightmare
 i proudly signed the brand new us-mexico-canada agreement in july
 that's a big difference
 like day and night
 it's working out great too
 it's working out great
 you know how i know that it's a good deal for us
 because they don't like it
 i took the toughest ever action to stand up to china's rampant theft of ohio jobs
 we achieved american energy
 we passed record tax cuts and regulations
 our energy independence is incredible
 we have now energy independence
 we don't have to be in these far away lands anymore
 now we'll be there to help certain allies that have been great but we don't have to be
 since my election natural gas production in ohio has surged 63
 they want to close it up
 by the way you do know they want to close it up
 they want to close up all fracking natural gas ever
 they want to close it up
 this would kill at least 700000 ohio jobs
 probably more than a million
 while i'm president america will remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas and ohio workers will continue leading the way
 i just left the great state of texas and i talked to a lot of people like this a great crowd of people
 we have tremendous support all over the country
 i'll tell you what
 these people are great
 and here's the platform that they have
 sleepy joe biden
 no oil no religion no god and no guns
 now i'm in texas
 it's a really rough thing in ohio but now we're talking texas
 no oil that doesn't work well in texas right
 no guns
 that doesn't work well in texas
 no god
 look what they're doing to the churches and everything
 that doesn't work
 no god
 no religion
 that doesn't work well
 you would have to be george washington with your running mate would be abraham lincoln
 okay
 your vp candidate
 and you'd still lose very big
 and then they say- … and you'd still lose very big
 and then they say yeah he's doing okay
 he's two up in texas
 they said it last time too that texas is even four years ago
 and everybody said no i think trump is killing it
 we'd have stadiums with 25000 30000 people much more that couldn't get in
 we'd have 40000 50000 people outside and they'd say i was even
 we won in a landslide just like we won this state in a landslide
 you know the expression they use texas is in play
 you know what in play means
 it could go either way
 and guys would get on there and say i don't think so
 and then that night again the polls in texas have closed
 donald trump has won the great state of texas
 i mean the whole thing is crazy
 it's crazy it's crazy
 you know what they do
 it's suppression polls
 they try and depress you
 they try and make you unhappy so you go out to dinner with your wife your husband you go out to dinner darling let's have dinner
 it's so sad
 we love donald but he just can't make it
 he can't make it
 let's go out have dinner
 we'll come home and watch the results
 except 2016 came and nobody did that they all went out and voted and we kicked ass
 tell me was that the most exciting evening in the history of television
 did you ever see the ratings the combined ratings
 i think the biggest ever
 but was that the most exciting
 2016 was that the most exciting evening in the history of television
 we invested 2
5 trillion in the u
s
 military including more than 6 billion in contracts
 i'll tell you what you like the word pronounced lima or lima because i saved lima
 and i tell you what i saved lima
 i came here and they were going to close that plant in lima
 they were going to close the tank plant
 it was done
 and i said why are we closing a tank plant
 and i got a couple of calls from my friends the congressman right here
 and i got calls
 and jim jordan called me
 do you like jim jordan
 he's great
 and i looked at this army tank plant in lima
 i said why are we closing it
 and i saw the people building the tanks and the technology's incredible
 and if you ever closed it you'd never be able to open a thing like that again
 so i overrode the generals i overrode everybody and now we're making a record number of tanks in that plant and it's absolutely thriving
 but we had tremendous success
 we took 100 of the isis caliphate and we killed the founder and leader of isis al-baghdadi
 we took out the world's number one terrorist and the mass murder of american troops and many other people
 qasem soleimani is dead
 he's dead
 i withdrew from last administration's disastrous iran nuclear deal
 they paid 150 billion plus 1
8 billion in cash
 you know they got
 nothing
 they got nothing
 i kept my promise recognized the true capital of israel and opened the american embassy in jerusalem
 every president for many many decades said they were going to do it
 they never did it
 they never did it
 they didn't have the guts to do it
 they campaigned on it they were all going to do it
 then they got there there was a lot of pressure put on them
 a lot of pressure put on me
 every leader was calling all over
 please don't do it
 please don't do it
 mr
 president please don't do it
 don't do it
 don't move it
 just leave it the way it is
 it's okay
 but i promised and i said i'm going to do it
 and then i got calls from the biggest people in the world
 kings i got calls from presidents from prime ministers please please don't tell it
 then i got calls please have him call me back me me
 i said look tell everybody i'm out for three days
 i'm not going to be able to call them back
 i had a news conference we announced it
 then i called everybody back
 hey how you doing
 how's everything going
 everything going good
 yeah well i wanted to talk to you about israel but it's too late
 you already did it
 and we did it and we got it done and nobody else got it done
 and it's something we had to do
 i also recognized israeli sovereignty over the golan heights
 and instead of endless wars we are forging peace all over the middle east
 and you saw that
 and i'm the only man that got nominated for a nobel peace prize and i didn't get any press
 they wouldn't
 for two of them
 last week i'm not bragging about it i'm just saying i'm the president of the united states because of kosovo-serbia they've been killing each other for years i worked out a deal for them
 i got nominated
 and then israel with bahrain and uae and many more to come
 i mean they all want to do it
 we'll have peace in the middle east without blood all over the sand
 no blood
 we're going to have peace in the middle east
 so i was nominated for the nobel peace prize
 and i told this story last night
 should i tell it or not
 should i
 yes
 she wants me to do it
 so i go home to our great first lady
 i said first lady you're going to be so proud of me tonight
 i was nominated not once but twice for totally separate events by different people
 great people
 first lady i was nominated for the nobel peace prize
 i was like this
 i was nominated
 it's a big deal for our country right
 and she said oh that's good
 i said let's turn on the evening news
 let's watch it
 this is going to be a big show tonight
 get ready
 and nbc which is one of the most crooked one of the worst newscasts and i'm talking about normal nbc not msdnc
 msdnc is the worst
 so i turned on nbc with lester holt another beauty
 and they start with a hurricane and then they went to something and something else
 and i'm saying first lady this is getting a little embarrassing
 we're 20 minutes into a half hour show
 they haven't mentioned the nobel peace prize
 and then it went through the whole show and they never mentioned
 then i got nominated for a second one
 they never mentioned
 and when barack obama barack hussein obama got nominated now when barack hussein obama got nominated he didn't know why he was nominated
 it was like right at the very beginning
 he didn't do anything
 he did nothing and he got nominated
 it was the biggest story i've ever seen
 but that's okay
 in the meantime we're president and they're not
 no that's right
 you would think if you nominated for the nobel prize you'd get maybe half a second
 the first lady she said sorry darling
 that's the way it goes isn't it
 joe biden opposed the mission to take out osama bin laden
 he opposed killing soleimani
 he voted for the iraq war disaster
 he backed the disastrous iran nuclear deal
 and he cheered the rise of china as a very positive development for our country
 oh it's really great
 if it were up to sleepy joe bin laden and soleimani would be alive today isis would be on a rampage iran would control the middle east and china would be the dominant power anywhere in the world
 and i want to tell you if you go back a few months before this pandemic we were gaining gaining gaining
 we had an insurmountable lead on china
 i always heard they were going to catch us by 2019 for 10 years
 we were so far beyond we were doing much better than they were
 the biden agenda would obliterate our economy
 he destroyed social security destroyed protections for pre-existing conditions
 that's what he's going to do drain your medicare by giving away your healthcare to illegal immigrants
 he would end our travel ban to jihadist regions and increase refugee admissions by listen to this over 700
 and this is the manifesto with bernie sanders with crazy bernie
 he made this deal with crazy bernie
 and by the way a lot of the crazy bernie voters last time four years ago voted for trump because of trade because the one thing they do understand that our country has been off for years
 biden opposes school choice and vowed to ban charter schools
 very important to have them
 in a second term i will provide school choice to every parent in america
 they're totally against it
 a vote for republicans is a vote for safe communities great jobs and a limitless future for all americans
 and just in conclusion first of all it's been a great honor to be with you
 this is really it's a great state
 they're great people
 i really mean it
 no i really mean it
 get out there on november 3rd
 we've got to win this one big
 this is a bad bad ideology
 this is probably a step beyond socialism
 i really think in many ways it's communism we're talking about
 this is a step beyond
 socialism's no good
 communism's really bad
 but get out there on november 3rd and let's show him your stuff and show them the stuff of all of us
 so in concluding over the next four years we will make america into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we will end the reliance this ridiculous crazy reliance on china and all of these far away lands once and for all
 we will make our medical supplies right here in the united states
 we will hire more police
 and by the way thank you police
 thank you law enforcement
 increased penalties for assaults on law enforcement and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities
 we will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life
 we will uphold religious liberty free speech and the right to keep and bear arms
 we will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep america out of these ridiculous stupid endless foreign wars
 we will maintain america's unrivaled military
 our military might has never been like it is right now because of what we've done
 and we had no choice and hope to god we never have to use it because if you would ever see the power of what we've done over the last three years it's almost better for you not to see it
 we are the envy of every power every country in the world
 we have weapons that nobody ever even thought possible
 and just as i said hope to god we never have to use them
 and the way we don't have to use them is to keep that kind of strength
 nobody's going to be talking to us
 we're going to have peace through strength and it's all made in the u
s
a
 made in the u
s
a
 we'll end surprise medical billing require price transparency

 that doesn't mean the drug companies and the hospital and corporations are happy with me
 but that's okay
 and further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs by 50 60 and 70
 big pharma does not like me too much
 they're taking ads about me that are so bad but you get it you understand it
 they're not too thrilled with me including the rebates
 the rebates go back to you
 the rebates before went back to very rich people
 we will strongly protect medicare and social security and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions
 and america will land the first woman on the moon and the united states will be the first nation to land an astronaut on mars
 that's what's happening
 nasa is again the leading space station anywhere in the world
 there's nothing like a space center what we've done
 and there was grass growing in the runways when i took over three and a half years ago
 we will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education
 we will teach our children to love our country honor our history and always respect our great american flag
 and we will live by the timeless words of our national motto in god we trust
 for years you had a president who apologized for america

 so get your friends get your family get your neighbors get your co-workers get everybody and get out and vote
 got to get out and vote
 and in your state in ohio early voting has already begun and don't wait

 the authorities awaiting and watching
 from akron to columbus from cincinnati to queen city i know it weller than cleveland and from dayton to toledo we inherit the legacy of generations of ohio patriots like neil armstrong annie oakley william mckinley and the amazing ulysses s
 grant that's good
 nobody's stock has gone up like grant
 nobody in the last 10 years
 we stand on the shoulders of american heroes who crossed the oceans blazed the trails settled the continent tamed the wilderness dug out the panama canal laid down the railroads raised up the skyscrapers won two world wars defeated fascism and communism and made america the single greatest nation in the history of the world and you haven't seen anything yet
 proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country
 we are returning power to you the american people
 with your help your devotion and your drive we are going to keep on working we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning winning winning
