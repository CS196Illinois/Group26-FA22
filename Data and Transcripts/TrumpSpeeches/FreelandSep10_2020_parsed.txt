we brought you a lot of car plants michigan
 we brought you a lot of car plants
 you know that right
 long time it's been a long time since you had all these plants being built but we brought you a lot over the last three and a half years and we're going to bring you a lot more
 that's happening
 hello michigan and i'm thrilled to be in freeland with thousands of loyal hardworking american patriots
 fifty-four days from now we're going to win michigan and we're going to win four more years in the white house
 this is the most important election in the history of our country
 joe biden devoted his career to offshoring michigan's jobs outsourcing- we shouldn't be smiling about it but we've changed it around
 outsourcing michigan's factories throwing open your borders dragging us into endless foreign wars and surrendering our children's future to china and other far away lands
 biden supported every disastrous globalist sellout for over a half a century including nafta china and dpp
 you know that
 joe biden surrendered your jobs to china and now he wants to surrender our country to the violent left wing mob and you're seeing that every night
 if biden wins china wins
 if biden wins the mob wins
 if biden wins the rioters anarchist arsonist and flag burners win
 but i wouldn't worry about it because he's not winning
 i don't think he's winning
 this is not the crowd of a person who comes in second place
 you do know that
 the same thing happened four years ago
 it was election eve but by the time i got here it was late
 some of you are in that audience at one o'clock in the morning now election day
 we had 32000 people show up and the reason i went is that i heard that crooked hillary clinton bill clinton and barack hussein obama were traveling to michigan because they heard they had problems
 they were supposed to win michigan but they did such a lousy job that they had to come and get some votes
 they came and i heard about it
 they said sir could you do it
 i hopped in the plane
 we landed at 12 o'clock in the evening
 i started speaking at one o'clock in the morning now election day
 32000 people
 she had 500 people
 i said why are we going to lose michigan
 and we didn't
 and we didn't
 first time in a long time but now we're up in the polls
 we just saw polls
 we're up in michigan
 i don't know if that's good or bad
 i don't know
 i don't know if that's good or bad because in all those polls where we were down last time we won
 so maybe we're better off being down a little bit
 hello john james
 i see you handsome guy
 john james get out and vote for john
 i'm going to introduce you in a second john james
 what a job you've done
 i have to tell you he took i saw this group of people that were running all nice people three very rich people and one guy that was john james and i saw them all
 right
 i saw them all and i said wait
 with the wonderful invention of tivo one of the greats you can play it back
 i said who was that
 he said i don't know sir
 i said play it back
 i said that man is going to be a star
 it was john james
 that was in the republican primary
 after learning about him with his incredible career and helicopter and he's a great and actually a great flyer i heard the other day a great one a really good one as opposed to those that aren't so good but his incredible background and education at west point and all of the things he did
 i said this guy and i endorsed him and he went like a rocket ship
 frankly if he had a little more support he would have won the last time
 this time i hear you're even and maybe even ahead and we're going to win with john james
 he's a great guy but i'm going to introduce him in a second
 i'm running for reelection to keep jobs in michigan
 we have got a lot of … last year before the china plague came in we have the china plague
 thank you china very much
 should have never let that happen
 they should have never ever let it happen
 they stopped it from going into china but they didn't stop it from coming out here and coming into the us in europe and the rest of the world 188 countries
 but it is what it is and we're not happy about it and we're going to remember it
 we're going to remember it but we had in michigan and in the country the greatest economy in the history of the world there has never been an economy
 now we're building it again and it's being built fast
 by the way it's turning out to be john a super v
 no more v
 now it's starting out to be a super v but to put violent criminals behind bars and to ensure the future belongs to america not to china because if we win america wins and that's what it's about
 if we win america wins
 not only does joe biden want to eliminate your jobs he wants to eliminate your borders
 he's promised to flood your state with refugees
 you know that as well as i do
 you see it all the time
 from terrorist hotspots around the world including syria somalia and yemen biden's pledged to have a 700 increase
 he made this deal with crazy bernie a 700 increase in the flow of refugees
 so he wants to lift it up by 700
 this is in their manifesto
 he's also pledged to terminate all national security travel bans overwhelming your state with poorly vetted migrants from jihadist regions
 making matters worse he would open the flood gates in the middle of a pandemic
 by the way the wall it's over 311 miles long right now doing very well
 doing very well
 make the mic louder the mic louder
 biden is waging war against the american middle class
 i think most of you are not middle class
 you're upper class
 you're the elite
 you know the way they talk about the elite the elite they're really elite
 i see them
 they're not elite
 you're the elite
 the elite has decided
 boy have we hurt the elite haven't we now
 you're the super elite
 the left wants to get rid of me so they can come after you
 it's very simple
 over the last three and a half years we've secured america's borders blocked the entry of foreign terrorist fixed our disastrous trade deals and we have fixed our trade deals good
 they are good
 in fact biden was interviewed today on … there they are
 cnn
 no he was just interviewed today
 he was interviewed by jake tapper who i find to be a nice guy
 i don't think he likes me too much but that's okay
 he was interviewed on cnn and they said which is better nafta or the usmca
 he said no no the usmca
 tapper goes what
 couldn't believe it
 he said usmca
 he made a mistake
 from his perspective he made a mistake because he doesn't know what's going on
 even though he's right he doesn't know
 there were a little surprised to hear that
 they gave him a few chances
 let's ask that question again but we brought back our manufacturing jobs
 we rebuilt the awesome power of the us military
 we obliterated the isis caliphate and built the greatest economy in the history of the world
 now we are doing it again bigger and better than ever before
 before the end of the year we will have a safe and effective vaccine and we will defeat the china virus
 i have a feeling … by the way i think the vaccine is going to come very soon going to come very soon
 with it or without it we're rounding the turn
 you see what's happening
 you see the numbers are plunging
 you see how good we're doing relative to other countries and other parts of the world but the fake news doesn't like saying that
 they don't like telling you that
 next year unless you have somebody that's going to quadruple your taxes raise your taxes raise up all of those regulations that we cut next year will be one of the greatest years of the history of our country
 at no time before has there been a clearer choice between two parties two visions two philosophies and two agendas for the future
 there's never been a vision like this
 you have sleepy joe and you have trump
 sleepy joe he's a beauty
 he's a beauty
 he's a beauty
 i watched the democrat debates right
 i watched them up there and he was so bad
 i said there's no way he makes it
 it's sad isn't it
 the first lady actually came in and one time she watched it and she goes and she's a nice person
 she meant this really me i view it differently
 but she looked at she watched the debate and she watched joe and she said darling it's so sad
 this was early on
 this is the guy i'm running against
 it's so sad
 darling it's so sad
 but we got them
 joe biden has put forward the most extreme platform and it's not him
 he doesn't know what platform
 he doesn't
 it's your radical left people
 it's aoc plus three
 it's all these people
 bernie
 it's bernie
 it's kamala the most liberal person in the us senate
 i tell it all the time
 she started off her poll numbers at 15 14 12 12
 then she went back up to 12 and a half
 then there was a big plunge right down to the bottom and then she dropped out
 she dropped out but there's never been anything like this
 no major party has ever had a candidate that's so extreme in his views
 again he took the manifesto drawn up by bernie and the super lips and that's what he's going by including a massive increase in your taxes and a total assault on your second amendment
 on november 3rd michigan you better vote for me
 i got you so many damn car plants
 i'll tell you what i'll be so angry at you
 i got you a lot of plants
 is that right
 i mean have you seen how we're doing here
 all the plants that have been built are being built and what about the plants that are being expanded
 they don't want to give you credit for that
 they just expanded
 i went to prime minister abe of japan
 i say prime minister you have to start doing something
 he's a great guy
 he'll be retiring soon
 he's a great guy the prime minister of japan abe
 i say shinzō shinzō you have to do me a favor
 you've got to send car plants over here
 you're sending all those cars
 we stupidly don't
 now they've been building it for a number of years but you hadn't had a plan built in like 42 years
 they were the old plants
 and it's been amazing what's happened in michigan
 but honestly it's been amazing what's happened in ohio and north carolina and south carolina and florida and new hampshire and so many other places
 our country is doing great
 we had to take a pause to get rid of the china virus and we got rid … we're coming around
 we're coming around that turn
 i'm telling you you watch next year better than last year
 it's going to be better than last year
 michigan will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity or whether we'll allow sleepy joe to impose 4 trillion in tax hikes ban american energy confiscate your guns shut down the economy and tell your governor to open up your state
 it's all democrat governors
 and i think they do it for political reasons because there'll be less activity
 you'd be doing even better if you had a governor that knew what the hell she was doing
 you got to open it up the state
 and also you have to have a governor because right now michigan's lagging
 great football great coach great team
 we want a governor john james that's going to let michigan play big ten football this year
 you've been seeing a lot of the other schools want to open big ten at my suggestion
 how about sleepy joe
 he said donald trump is against football
 no no no
 i'm the one that says open it up let's play football
 these people practice disinformation like nobody has ever practiced it
 they're liars
 i'll tell you they lie
 but we have a good chance
 you have a very good commissioner and the commissioner is working hard and hopefully very soon they'll say you're going to play football
 and i hope they're not leaving michigan out because it's never the same if they do
 but you have maryland where they have a problem in terms of playing
 and the governors have a lot of power over that
 they have a lot of power a lot of say
 so let's play big ten football right
 they want to shut down auto production delay the vaccine
 they want to destroy your suburbs
 look at what i've done for your suburbs
 you know what i've done
 you know what i've done
 does anybody want to have somebody from antifa as a member and as a resident of your suburb
 i don't think so too much
 say darling who moved in next door
 oh it's a resident of antifa
 no thank you
 let's get out of here
 let's get the hell out of here darling
 let's leave our suburbs
 i wish trump were president
 he wouldn't have allowed that to happen
 and that's exactly right i won't allow it to happen
 the suburbs are the american dream and i will tell you i have protected your suburbs
 i got rid of a regulation that played with your zoning and played with other things where they force projects into the suburbs of our great country
 and i got rid of it
 they said sir we can amend it and make it less crazy
 i said no i don't want to amend it
 i don't want to do that
 i want to get rid of it
 well sir why don't we just do a simple amendment
 it would be … i said i want to get rid of it
 end it
 and we ended it
 we ended it
 i think the people living in the suburbs … which i know very well
 i watched westchester in new york where they were doing things that should never have been done and it's not going to happen to our suburbs
 they want to erase your borders and indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-american lies in our schools
 not going to happen
 not going to happen
 for the last four years they've tried everything to stop us and they are only getting more desperate by the day
 can you imagine if on september 3rd they say ladies and gentlemen donald trump has been declared the winner
 donald trump has been declared … at first they'll go crazy
 and then they'll say okay it's time now to be reasonable
 they will have had it
 they will have had it
 we were coming together as a nation
 very interesting
 before the plague came in from china we will coming together
 it was success
 somebody said what's going to bring you together
 and it was
 we were coming together
 i was starting to get calls from democrats that … frankly we didn't speak much
 and i was starting to get calls and then all of a sudden we saw the plague pour in and we saw what was happening and it really stopped things
 but success was getting very very close to bringing us all together
 and then we had to say let's take a time out
 we got to fix this mess
 and we did and now we're coming back strong but success brings us together and it was happening and then we got that terrible situation happened and we'll never forget it
 biden and his party tried to lock law-abiding americans into their homes while they encourage rioters and vandals rampaging through in all cases democrat-run cities
 republican-run cities are doing very well
 i hope you know that
 and i hope you know like in minneapolis we were asked to come in we went in we took care of that problem in about what 30 minutes
 unfortunately they let almost two weeks go by
 and if you look at what we just did in wisconsin which was so amazing three days and we went in
 and by the way the us marshals went in to get the killer and that was the end of that
 they got the killer they got the killer
 you know what i'm talking about
 and we were going to go into seattle
 the next day we're all set all lined up looking forward to it
 we just said we're doing it
 i mean they actually took over a part of the city and the mayor said this is going to be a summer of love right
 where do these people come from
 but we were all set to go in there heard we were going in we informed them we're going in and they sent their police to do it and we never even had to go in
 but we can solve those problems in a matter of literally minutes
 thank you
 don't say that i'll start to cry and that wouldn't be good for my image
 you don't want to see me cry
 i'll start to cry
 one of the fake news broadcasters because this happened the other day we had a tremendous crowd like this
 i mean we had a tremendous crowd in north carolina
 they started chanting we love you
 we love you
 we love you
 and it's incredible they said with all the years that they've been covering presidential elections they've never heard that chant that we love you
 no it's very nice
 no they've never heard it
 true
 now they'll say he misrepresented
 18 years ago there was a rally held by somebody and we heard the words from two people that ‘we love you sir
' now this is what we're dealing with
 and by the way i look out there's a lot of people that … look at this
 there's people back there that can't even get in
 thank you michigan
 thank you
 it's really nice to be with you
 as president i will always support the heroes of law enforcement
 i was very honored to receive the endorsement of the police officers association of michigan
 where are they
 where are they
 they're here someplace
 where are they
 thank you fellows
 that's really nice
 i'll tell you
 that's an honor
 i have to be honest
 i got it from florida texas ohio north carolina south … but michigan is michigan
 thank you
 i don't think there's any law enforcement officer that is against us
 what is our poll number
 99
 i know they had 365000 at one group and they got a unanimous vote
 i said that's pretty good
 how can you go the other way
 you people are fantastic and we love you
 thank you
 that's great
 thank you very much
 appreciate it
 biden says he wants to protect black lives but his radical platform will cut short the lives of thousands of young african american citizens
 thousands
 the murder rate in democrat-run cities like chicago baltimore new york so many others is higher than in afghanistan yet biden supports imposing these failed policies nationwide
 you will have crime like you've never seen before
 you'll have crime like you've never seen
 last week joe biden proudly accepted the endorsement of the pro-criminal portland district attorney who has a policy of releasing rioters criminals and violent extremists without charge
 biden's plan … and every time i say biden's plan it's not his plan it's the people that tell them what they're going to do so please understand
 i just don't want to say that every time i mention his name
 so it should say the people that control biden's plan is to appease domestic terrorists
 my plan is to arrest them to lock them up
 if joe biden is elected far left lunatics won't just be running failed democrat city they'll be running the department of justice the department of homeland security and the united states supreme court and we can't let that happen
 no city town or suburb will be safe
 on november 3rd your vote will save america
 remember it's the most important election we've ever had
 i'm joined tonight by some great warriors that have really helped me a lot in washington with the fake impeachment the impeachment hoax the russia russia russia hoax
 somebody said russia's coming up again
 adam schiff said we'd like to find out about … i said what about china
 what about other countries
 it's always russia
 russia russia
 they're at it again
 i want to just thank these guys because these were real warriors for all of us
 they love your state and they love our country
 congressman jack bergman
 great job jack
 john moolenaar
 thank you john
 great
 great going john
 he's a tough cookie
 and tim walberg
 tim thank you
 great job
 what great people
 and i talked about him a little while before i could talk about him all night
 he's a star
 he's going to be a future star
 we have a very much different party than we had four years ago
 we're now the party of the workers
 we're the party of a lot of different things now but we weren't really considered the party of the workers
 certainly not anymore
 remember this we're the party of abraham lincoln
 a lot of people forget that
 honestly
 remember when they used to say he doesn't act presidential
 and i used to say it's so easy to be presidential
 i'd only have about 10 or 15 people here
 you'd be bored
 but remember i used to do that
 but i'd always say i can be more presidential than any president in our history except for the possibility of abraham lincoln when he wears his hat
 tough to beat
 that's tough to beat john james
 but seriously if you want to be well-represented … your current senator i don't even know this guy
 i don't even know this guy
 nobody does
 they don't know who he is
 they don't even know
 he comes into the office i say who is that guy
 i know every senator
 democrat republican
 i don't know this guy
 i know your other senator
 i can tell by her hair
 she's got interesting hair
 but that was john's first crack
 he learned a lot
 and frankly and i mean this if he had more support from the republican party he would've won that race
 he would've
 but this guy peters right
 peters
 i say who's peters
 nobody knows him
 he doesn't do anything
 i mean look we're going to end this but i have to tell you john james can be so great
 he loves our country
 he's been educated at the highest level
 he was always the top at everything he's ever done
 and this is what he has
 and i'll be honest with you john
 i think i can tell this story
 john and i were thinking about john
 i was thinking about john more than myself because i know talent
 and i said john you can run for a certain house seat right
 and you're guaranteed to win
 you can run for another house seat
 it'll be a tough race but you're going to win
 or you can have a tough race against somebody that nobody ever heard of
 it's like a habit that they press that particular trigger but that's a tough race
 so you can be an absolute congressman or you can take a shot at this one
 he said sir i can do more in the senate than i can do in the house
 and that was his decision
 right
 took a lot of guts
 so john i'm with you
 you have my total and complete endorsement
 you have everything i can do
 everything i can do we will do for you
 and i really believe you're going to make it
 you're running against somebody that is just ridiculous folks
 it's ridiculous
 don't do it
 also with us are some other great candidates and people that are going to do a tremendous job helping our congressman
 paul junge
 where's paul junge
 paul thank you
 good luck
 i heard you're doing well paul
 paul junge
 lisa mcclain
 lisa
 great job
 it's going well
 and eric essahki
 thank you eric
 good luck
 good luck
 we're going to be out here helping you too
 we're going to be out here
 i hope john doesn't even need help but we're going to help john too
 we're going to help all of you
 all right
 we're going to be doing it
 thank you
 also with you is rnc chairwoman
 she was the head of the whole state and she kept calling me back back
 sir one more speech you're going to win michigan
 hadn't been won in decades
 one more speech sir you're going to win michigan
 i said all right
 ron i'm coming in one more time but that's it
 i said that woman is the most aggressive person i've ever met
 she said i'm telling you sir one more speech
 i said all right i'll do it one more time but that's it
 about a day after i got back i said i just got back from michigan
 it was wonderful
 i get a call from ronna mcdaniel and she goes sir could you come in tomorrow for another speech
 well whatever happens she is the one that got me here at midnight on … she is
 so when it came time to picking the head of the rnc as president you have a couple of things to say about it right
 i said who's that woman that kept getting me back to michigan
 boy oh boy she'll be great
 ronna mcdaniel
 and somebody's doing a fantastic job and tells us we're really pretty far ahead
 maybe way ahead
 they had a poll
 i think it was a gallup poll
 they said 62 of the people are lying about their poll
 now they're only lying having to do with my … and i don't know if i'm supposed to be insulted by that or not but we'll take it
 but we could have a very big win
 and look no president has done for michigan what president trump has done for michigan
 and you're going to remember that
 and i'm going to remember michigan
 michigan gop chair laura cox
 great
 thank you
 great job
 great job
 thank you
 thank you very much
 thanks laura
 we spent the last four years reversing the horrible damage joe biden inflicted over the last 47 years
 47 years of bad votes
 after the last administration nearly killed the us auto industry i saved the us auto industry
 joe biden supported the disastrous trans-pacific partnership which would have been a death sentence for american auto jobs
 i withdrew from the tpp my first week in office
 that was so easy
 that was so easy
 you wouldn't have been making cars
 you would've been buying cars from foreign lands
 we have enough of that
 biden supported the horrendous south korea deal that would've wiped out us production of the pickup truck which is the most … the pickup truck is the most profitable thing the auto industry makes
 you know why
 we have something called the chicken tax
 does anyone know what i'm talking about
 the chicken tax
 it's a tariff of 25 and it keeps other countries out of here and it expired and south korea didn't want to do it but they did it
 we got it right back and we put it on for a long time and now you're making … but remember this go check it out
 the chicken tax
 i'll tell you why someday at another meeting why they call it that
 maybe you don't want to know about it
 but we're keeping those small trucks and we're keeping our whole industry good
 and we're expanding our autos now our cars and we're doing a great job of it and i want to thank everybody
 doing a great job
 and by the way many other things in michigan
 biden supported the outrageous fuel economy standards that have hammered the auto industry and i reversed that rule
 i actually reversed it and it helped millions of families be able to afford a car
 the united states lost 500 auto and auto parts factories under the obama-biden disaster
 before the virus my administration added over 200 new auto and auto parts plants
 how about 200
 i didn't know that
 200
 200
 i thought it was a little less than that
 wait i want to see that again
 200
 it's … … than that
 wait i want to see that again 200
 it says 200
 do you believable it
 that's a lot
 you know i have a choice between teleprompter and freelance
 i hate to say the freelance is always a hell of a lot better but … if you remember and you remember well i actually got elected because of freelance
 we didn't have teleprompters
 there were no teleprompters
 but think of that 200 we're talking about 200 plants
 i thought it was a much lower number
 i thought you should put me in an office based on a much lower number
 at 200 you have no choice
 yesterday biden was in michigan
 he said i better get out of the basement
 this guy is starting to do very well lying about his lifetime of cold hearted globalist betrayals
 biden championed nafta perhaps the worst trade deal in the history of our country
 he continued to embrace and promote nafta for decades
 i told you he just said it was not as good as the deal i made
 i can't believe oh they're giving him hell tonight
 they're giving him hell
 what did you say that for
 boy oh boy
 yeah hiding
 ‘joe hiden
' look this doesn't sound nice
 i'll say it and they'll criticize for it you watch
 but i have the distinct pleasure of running against the worst presidential candidate in the history of presidential politics
 i really believe that
 i do
 can you imagine if i lost to him
 i'd have to say i lost to the worst candidate ever put up
 don't do that to me michigan
 don't do that
 biden supported china's entry into the world trade organization which by the way was a disaster
 china was flatlining for years and years and decades and it got into this world trade organization with all sorts of advantages
 just a terrible terrible situation took place
 that's when china became a big powerful economic power
 but if you look at the numbers just before the plague now the numbers are different we were going up up up we were beating them like a drum
 they weren't even close
 we were gaining gaining gaining
 we were number one by far
 you know for years i've heard that in 2019 china was going to surpass us
 well in 2019 we gained a lot on them
 we were doing great
 we were doing great and we'll be doing even better next year you watch
 yesterday it was revealed that a fund partly owned by joe biden's son where's hunter
 see his first name i now name … his first name is where
 where's hunter
 he must be a brilliant guy because with no experience he's taken more money from more countries
 he had no job and then he became rich
 but where's hunter who facilitated the sale of a michigan automotive company to a leading chinese military defense contractor
 does anyone know that china's military got yet another piece of american manufacturing mike and the biden family made a lot of money on it
 it was a lot of money
 what about ukraine
 he got 183000 a month 3 million upfront and he had no experience with energy working for an energy company by the way
 what's your experience hunter
 what's your experience with energy
 i don't have any
 okay
 we'll pay you 183000 a month and i will give you an upfront payment hunter of 3 million
 will that be satisfactory
 he goes yes
 i'll take it
 would anybody here not take that deal
 anybody
 please raise your head
 this is one guy right you must be a pretty rich guy
 if biden's elected china will own america
 washington vultures like biden and others ripped apart entire towns all across your state
 michigan lost half of all manufacturing jobs after the trade deals that biden supported
 by the way i don't know if anybody … but does anybody remember like 12 years ago
 long before i thought about running for president when i enjoyed my life i had the greatest life
 where would we like to go
 let's go to monte-carlo this weekend
 let's go
 no i had a great life but i was honored
 i was doing very well
 i was honored in michigan
 does anybody know that
 i was given man of the year award by somebody
 i came in and i spent like 45 minutes talking about how you've been ripped off how all your auto companies are leaving and going to mexico and by the way to canada too
 but how they're all leaving and going to mexico and canada
 i spent the whole time talking about it
 at the end i felt embarrassed i said i hope i haven't insulted the state too much but why do you let this happen
 i stopped it
 i stopped
 it won't be happening
 it won't be happening
 it's not going to happen anymore
 biden took a sledgehammer to your state earlier this year i kept my promise to michigan workers when we ended the nafta nightmare that everybody said was impossible to end and when we signed that brand new us- mexico-canada agreement into law
 the usmca includes powerful wage protections to keep auto manufacturing jobs right here in michigan
 now they have a tremendous disincentive to leave michigan fire all of our workers go to mexico or canada make the car or the product send it in here without tariffs
 we end up with closed factories no job and no taxes
 that's not happening anymore
 that's not happening anymore
 but do you remember how bad it was just before i took office
 it was like an avalanche of companies leaving our country
 i also took the toughest ever action to stand up to china's rampant theft of michigan jobs
 biden has vowed to remove these tariffs and allow china to resume its pillaging
 just so you know china's paying us tens of billions of dollars a month
 before me china never paid anything
 they didn't pay us 25 cents
 you know what i did with some of that money
 i gave it to our farmers
 i don't know if we have a lot do we have farmers here
 we have farmers
 raise your hands farmers
 that's not bad no i gave 28 billion to our farmers because they were targeted by china
 they were targeted
 they said you know … and that's what they did in the past to other presidents
 they said if you do this we're going to stop doing business with your farmers and you're not going to be able to get any votes and you're going to lose the midwest and all of that
 i said you know what
 i do whatever you want
 then i went to sonny perdue secretary of agriculture a great guy i said sonny how much are they being targeted for
 sir 12 billion the first year two years three years ago and then 16 billion a total of 28 billion
 i said that's okay
 we're putting tariffs on everything they send into our country 25
 was going to raise it to 50
 also 10 at 12 all different tariffs
 we took in billions and billions and i said you know what we're going to do
 we're going to take of that the 12 and the 16 28 billion and we're going to give it to our farmers who were targeted and our farmers are doing great
 that's what we did
 do you think joe biden would do that
 he wouldn't have a clue
 hillary wouldn't have had a clue
 crazy bernie wouldn't have nobody would add a clue on that one
 by the way we had tens of billions of dollars left over
 you know what i did with that
 we gave it to the us treasury right smack into the heart of the us treasury
 and we're still getting those big tariffs
 even though we made a trade deal with china
 i said no you got to leave the tariffs on
 a lot of people didn't know it
 schumer went well i don't like to do … first of all he didn't like tariffs and then all of a sudden he loves it
 but when i made the deal with china i left the tariffs on 25 and some different amounts
 when i left tariffs largely on and nobody could believe it
 i said to schumer what do you think of the deal
 i don't like it because you got rid of the tariffs
 i said no we left the tariffs on
 this is what it is
 no matter how you do it no matter how good the deal they'll say it's no good because they don't love the country
 they don't love the country
 remember that
 joe biden's agenda is made in china
 my agenda is made in the usa
 that's a nice plane
 somebody said to me your plane's just as nice as that
 i said no it's not
 that's air force one
 that's the nicest
 always that's the nicest
 i also authorize millions of dollars to save michigan soo locks and forget all the problems they had
 for years and years they fought over the money to do it
 we got 300 million to the great lakes restoration initiative and we have done a job on the soo locks
 they were rotting you
 weren't going to have anything come through the soo locks
 it's all done
 that deal is all done
 it's all done
 right
 thank you
 thank you
 where are my guys there
 good job
 right
 even though you're law enforcement that's a good job right
 two months ago i also issued a major disaster declaration in response to the catastrophic flooding caused by the failure of the edenville dam
 where are the people from edenville
 yeah good
 no that was a terrible thing and they're working very hard right now
 we're providing more than 43 million in federal funds to help homeowners businesses and communities in central michigan to recover from that catastrophe
 thank you
 perhaps in no area have our opponents more thoroughly betrayed working families of all backgrounds than on the subject of immigration
 under my administration we've achieved the most secure border in american history
 we've ended catch and release stopped asylum fraud and we've deported over 20000 vicious gang members and over a half a million criminal illegal aliens
 as i said we've already built over 310 miles of border wall
 it's all going to be finished very quickly
 we're averaging about 10 new brand new beautiful miles every single week
 it'll be finished very short
 we've invested 2
5 trillion in the us military
 all made in the usa by the way
 all made in the usa
 you know with the fake news today i said and we have systems and missiles and rockets and military and tech
 we have systems that you've never even seen before
 president xi has nothing like it
 putin has nothing like it
 nobody has anything like what we have
 they said is he giving away military information
 no i'm saying we have the greatest weapons in the world
 that's what i'm saying
 they said he may be giving away classified information
 you don't have to worry about it
 these people are sick
 never speak well about our technology because you're giving away classified information
 now i just want to let people know we have the greatest systems the greatest equipment and the greatest people anywhere in the world
 there's nobody like the us military
 we have the most powerful military in the world
 when i took it over it was depleted
 it was in trouble and was exhausted from these ridiculous endless wars that lasts 19 and 20 years and you know those soldiers are starting to come home very big
 you know that right

 we passed the mission act we call it va choice and va accountability
 we hold people accountable if they don't treat our vets good you're fired
 get out
 you're fine
 we did more in 47 months than sleepy joe biden did in 47 years
 that's true
 we did more
 that sort of has a nice ring to it
 right
 think of it
 we did more and it's true
 just take a look space force by itself that would be a major achievement and with us we did so many things so many things
 but we did more in 47 months than he did in 47 years
 it's true
 it's true
 a lot of what i did is destroy some of the horrible things that they did including regulations all over the place
 i withdrew from the last administration's disastrous iran nuclear deal
 we paid 150 billion 1
8 billion in cash
 we ought to speak to law enforcement about that
 how do we send 1
8 billion in cash
 in cash
 you guys ought to take a look at that please
 i kept my promise recognized the true capital of israel and opened the american embassy in jerusalem
 every president said they were going to do that and none of them did it for decades and decades they all said
 i tell this story it was a hard thing to get done
 it was easy to talk about in the campaign we're going to open up the embassy in jerusalem
 we're going to make it
 it becomes automatically the capital of israel
 everybody said it for very very many decades for decades many presidents
 but i realize now why it was an effort because as soon as i got in i was lobbied by everybody please don't do it
 don't do it
 don't make the capital of israel jerusalem
 don't move your embassy
 so went on and on
 then i said let's do it anyway
 it's true
 and the word got out
 the word got out that i was going to do it and i was called by every king and every queen and every prime minister and every … everybody was calling me please sir don't do it
 please
 so i did what we sometimes will do in business i told them … when a king calls when somebody calls an emir when somebody calls tell them i'll call them back in a few days
 i'm sorry sir
 he won't be able to speak right now he'll call you back on wednesday
 okay
 thank you very much
 i appreciate it
 on tuesday i announced that i'm doing it
 then i got on the phone with 18 different companies
 i go hey how you doing
 you called i'm just returning your call
 oh it's too late sir
 we called about israel
 it's too late
 i said gee i'm sorry
 i wish you got to me a little bit sooner
 i recognized israeli sovereignty over the golan heights and we achieved the first breakthrough in middle east peace in decades
 and by the way on wednesday i believe of next week prime minister benjamin netanyahu and as you know the country a very powerful very respected country with a great leader the uae is coming to the white house and we're going to sign an agreement that hasn't been signed in many decades
 it's peace and its recognition of israel and all of the things nobody thought it could be done
 it's an amazing thing
 i don't say this out of ego but i was nominated for the nobel peace prize
 now i have to tell you that's sort of a big thing and the networks and most of the news didn't cover it
 could you imagine
 when obama came to office they said we're going to give him the nobel peace prize
 he actually said what did i do
 i didn't do anything
 he didn't do anything for eight years frankly
 but he said what did i do
 they gave it to them in a matter of weeks right
 weeks
 with us we've done so much
 we have done so much on so many different fronts
 remember north korea
 remember
 they were going to be at war with north korea
 where's the war
 where's the war
 where's the war
 and we have a good relationship with kim jong-un
 who knows what happens
 all i know is we're not in war and that's okay
 they said but he gave away so much
 i said i gave away nothing
 no he gave away so much
 when i said what did they give away
 you know what they said
 uh we don't know
 i said here's what i gave away i gave away nothing
 they said oh but you agreed to meet
 oh i see
 i agreed to meet
 so now they're saying i agreed to meet it was such a big deal
 instead of being in a war i think agreeing to meet is okay right
 and we did
 he's a different kind of a guy and he's a smart guy a very smart guy
 we get along
 getting along with foreign powers is not a bad thing
 we're trying to teach that to the media and these idiots that ran our government for so many years
 these fools
 these fools
 you know you got nuclear weapons you got big armies big navies he gets along with putin
 that's a terrible thing
 no it's a good thing
 if i get along that's good
 he likes me
 i like him
 not so bad
 he gets along with kim jong-un
 … not so bad
 he gets along with kim jong-un
 that's a terrible thing
 no it's a good thing
 i'm trying to convince him
 it's okay
 it's okay not to go to war
 it's really okay
 he gets along with president xi he gets along with prime minister abe
 he gets along with a lot of people and it's okay
 that's a good thing
 it's really hard
 these stupid people that have been running this operation for 30 40 years and they come out against me and all they did was stick us in these endless wars
 we're fighting for sand and blood
 sand and blood
 syria what do you get out of it
 you get sand you get blood you get injuries you get death
 these people don't know what the hell they're doing and it's one of the reasons i got elected i can tell you that
 we don't like his foreign policy
 and this is said by one of the guy's that got us into the war in iraq got us into the middle east
 so it's … we're doing a great job
 we're doing a great job for you
 we're doing a great job for michigan
 just to finish in the middle east we killed the founder and leader of isis al-baghdadi
 and by the way we're pulling back and we're doing everything so beautifully
 if we do get into war we win the war
 we don't fight for nothing
 we fought for nothing
 we don't ever want to have war but if there is a war nobody's going to even come close to being able to beat us
 and we won't be depleted from fighting in all these ridiculous locations all over the globe
 you people know that a lot better than the idiots in washington that has represented us for 35 years
 we took out the world's number one terrorist and the mass murderer of american troops qasem soleimani is dead
 we kept america out of new wars and we're bringing our troops back home and they're coming home very rapidly
 you see that
 sleepy joe biden voted for the iraq war
 he supported the defense sequester that gutted our military destroyed our military set us back so many years
 i got rid of it immediately
 he opposed the mission to take out osama bin laden
 he was against it
 everything he did he was wrong on as said by gates you know
 secretary of defense secretary of everything
 he was sort of like … he had more jobs than any human being i've ever seen
 but he said everything everything that biden was for was wrong
 he opposed killing soleimani
 he oversaw the rise of isis
 he was unable to do anything with isis
 as he came to the white house two weeks ago
 and we cheered as we looked at all of the success that we've had but he really oversaw the rise of china as a positive development
 remember he said no it's a positive development for america and for the world
 he's been in washington for 47 years now
 he's all of a sudden going to change
 he's going to change
 he's not going to change
 don't forget he was in washington in his primetime which was never considered great and now it's no longer primetime
 when i banned travel from china biden called it hysterical and xenophobic
 if we had listened to joe hundreds of thousands more americans would have died from the china plague
 biden was willing to sacrifice american lives on the altar of open borders
 and now joe biden is once again hurting innocent people with his dangerous anti-vaccine conspiracy theories putting millions of lives around the world at risk
 and the only reason he's doing that is he knows we're right next to having a vaccine
 so he wants to belittle the vaccine because he doesn't want us to get credit plant who converted their factory to produce tens of thousands of ventilators after we invoked the defense production act and they've done a fantastic job
 not a single american who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator any time in our whole country
 they needed a ventilator we had nothing
 we were left bare cupboards
 i always say the cupboards were bare
 we're delivering lifesaving therapies and have achieved among the lowest case fatality rates anywhere of any country in the world
 europe's excess mortality rate is 24 higher than the rate in the united states
 you don't hear that from the fake news
 hey america will prevail over the china virus as franklin delano roosevelt said the only thing we have to fear is fear itself
 that's it
 we're doing very well
 as the british government advised the british people in the face of world war ii keep calm and carry on
 that's what i did
 this whack job that wrote the book he said well trump knew a little bit
 they wanted me to come out and scream people are dying we're dying
 no no we did it just the right way
 we have to be calm
 we don't want to be crazed lunatics
 we have to lead
 when hitler was bombing i don't know if you know this when hitler was bombing london churchill great leader would oftentimes go to a roof in london and speak and he always spoke with calmness
 he said we have to show calmness
 no we did it the right way and we've done a job like nobody
 all of those great generals all of those great admirals our great vice president mike pence they did a fantastic job
 our doctors and they don't get any credit because they want to discredit us as much as possible because they want it to carry over to november 3rd but we've done a fantastic job
 i think we've probably done the best job of any country certainly of any major country anywhere in the world on the pandemic
 through our historic relief programs we've saved more than 1
6 million michigan jobs and over 128000 michigan businesses
 michigan has already gained and regained more than half of the jobs that it lost and if your state was ever allowed to safely reopen by your governor who doesn't have a clue
 she's like joe
 you would have regained far more than that
 open up your state madam governor open up your state
 let's go
 just like crazy nancy pelosi your governor is a liberal hypocrite who lives by a different set of rules
 her husband was caught trying to put his boat in the water on memorial day weekend while she was ordering the people of michigan to stay in their homes and forcing businesses into bankruptcy left and right
 the biden agenda would collapse our economy and destroy this great opportunity that we're having right now
 he would impose job destroying regulations that would demolish the auto industry
 you know on regulations it took in many cases 18 19 20 years to get a roadway or a highway approved
 we have it down now to two years
 we're trying to get it down to one year and it may get disapproved for environmental or safety reasons but we're going to know about it very fast
 no more 20 year approvals or disapprovals
 he wants to force you to provide free government healthcare to illegal aliens
 he will destroy your social security
 he will destroy your protections for pre-existing conditions and we will save social security
 remember they said last time
 oh trump is going to destroy social security
 well it's now four years we haven't touched it
 we've protected it and that's going to remain that way
 biden opposes school choice and has stated that if he's elected charter schools so important are gone
 in a second term i will provide school choice to every parent in america
 a vote for republicans is a vote for safe communities great jobs and a limitless future for all americans instead of letting washington change us despite all that we have been through we are changing washington
 we will make our medical supplies right here in the united states and right here in michigan
 we will enact fair trade deals that create american jobs and grow american wages
 we will rapidly return to full employment soaring incomes and record prosperity and that's already happening
 we will hire more police increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement surge federal prosecutors into high crime communities and we will ban sanctuary cities
 we will appoint prosecutors judges and justices who believe in enforcing the law not their own political agenda
 we will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race color religion and creed
 we will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life
 we will uphold religious liberty free speech and the right to keep and bear arms
 and you're lucky i'm here because you're second amendment would be gone if i wasn't
 and they didn't touch it
 we will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep out people keep them out of these horrible horrible situations where they hurt our country they hurt the people of our country and we're also going to be staying out of the endless ridiculous foreign wars in countries that you've never even heard of
 we will build the most powerful missile and cyber defense
 we've already got it pretty much
 and we will maintain peace through strength
 we will end surprise medical billing require the biggest thing that nobody even knows about and it's all signed and it goes into effect on january 1st
 you better make sure i win
 can you imagine
 this is going to be the biggest thing and nobody understands what it is
 you'll figure it out
 price transparency
 did they fight me on that one
 january 1st
 and further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs at a level like you've never seen before
 i've already signed it
 favored nations
 the drug companies are not happy i will tell you
 just all you have to do is take a look at all the ads they're running against me
 favored nations where we pay whatever the lowest is in the world we pay that number
 we will protect medicare and social security and we will always protect our patients
 we will always our people
 we will your pre-existing conditions as i said
 america will land the first woman on the moon and the united states will be the first nation to land an astronaut on mars
 we will restore patriotic education you know what i mean by that and we will teach our children to love our country honor our history and always respect our great american flag
 and we will live by the timeless words of our national motto in god we trust
 and i don't know if you saw it but during the democrat national convention and caucus they took twice i thought i was sort of maybe they made a mistake you saw that they took the word god out of the pledge of allegiance twice
 and then they said oh well maybe it was a mistake
 it wasn't a mistake
 that's where they're coming from
 don't be foolish
 that's where they're coming from and there's nothing that sleepy joe biden can do about it
 for years you had a president who apologized for america
 now you have a president who is standing up for america and standing up for michigan
 so get your friends get your family get your neighbors and your coworkers and get out and vote
 so important
 from grand rapids to saginaw from kalamazoo to mackinac and from flint to right here in freeland we stand on the shoulders of generations of michigan patriots who gave their blood sweat and tears for this beloved nation
 this is the state where henry ford invented the assembly line
 it's the place where general motors chrysler and kellogg revolutionized entire industries
 michigan well you know this one right
 michigan gave us motown right
 that's right
 that's right motown
 we love motown
 michigan gave us motown gave us motown gave us the mustang and the unrivaled might of the american midwest
 this is the state where tough strong and determined workers made america into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of the world and we are making it greater and greater every single day
 proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we will be taking back our country we'll be taking it back from people that don't love our country and that take back is almost complete
 we have to win on november 3rd
 we're returning power to you the american people
 with your help your devotion and your drive we are going to keep on working
 we are going to keep on fighting
 and we are going to keep on winning winning winning we are going to keep on winning
 vote for john james
