thank you very much and thank you to the original lee greenwood
 thank you
 thank you lee
 great guy
 well i just want to say a very big hello kentucky
 great place
 it's great to be here in the home of a group called the wildcats
 you ever hear the kentucky wildcats
 by the way they play at a very big arena
 this place
 look at this
 hello up there
 this is incredible
 with thousands of proud hardworking freedom-loving american patriots which is what you are
 what you are
 tomorrow the people of kentucky will head to the polls and you will vote to reelect your terrific republican governor matt bevin
 he's done a fantastic job
 he's done a fantastic job
 and we're sending a signal by doing that to the rest of the country to the rest of the world that the republican party you know what we stand for
 but you see what's happening with the democrats they have gone crazy
 the do nothing democrats and they're not getting it done
 under republican leadership the economy is booming wages are rising confidence is soaring
 kentucky is thriving like never ever before and america is stronger than ever before
 true
 kentucky's unemployment rate has reached the lowest point in the history of our country
 that's not bad
 and i want to just tell you that you have incredible representatives and the job that matt bevin has done as governor he's had to do some things that you had to do
 and he's done unbelievably well
 it sets you up to be a rocket ship in the future
 you had to do it
 so i just want to thank him for having the courage to do what he had to do
 you have the best numbers you've ever had in the history of the state
 and with the help of your senate majority leader mitch mcconnell we have confirmed 157 judges to follow the constitution as written
 we're supporting our police we're rebuilding our military we're defeating radical islamic terrorists like never before
 the monsters animal known as al-baghdadi is dead
 and the man that took his place is dead also
 american special forces gave the world's number one terrorist a one way ticket to hell
 no enemy on earth stands a chance against the awesome power of the united states military which is now stronger than ever before
 we've rebuilt it and it was all made in america
 all made in america
 and our country is winning again and our country is highly respected again
 but while we are creating jobs and killing terrorists the radical democrats are going totally insane
 they want to obliterate the rule of law drive out faith from the public square and you know this silence you online confiscate your guns
 you better be careful
 the second amendment very very important very precious
 they are after your second amendment
 with us nobody's touching our second amendment
 and that includes the gentleman that's running against matt
 they're after your second amendment
 we can't let that happen
 they want to indoctrinate your children you know this destroy anyone who calls traditional america american values
 all you have to do is ask the boys from covington catholic high school
 some of whom are here tonight
 the far left wants to impose their authoritarian ideology on the nation telling you what to think what to believe and how you should live
 they want to erase our traditions our culture our history and our heroes
 they want to subjugate you and break you to their will but kentucky will never be broken
 kentucky can't be broken
 you're too strong and you're too smart
 in their craze thirst for power the democrats are trying to tear our country apart
 first democrats engineer the russia hoax the most egregious fraud ever foisted upon the american people the russian hoax
 then they did the mueller scam
 you remember that
 the mueller scam
 two years and they said nothing
 and then mr
 mueller testified
 that was a wonderful day for me
 you remember last week
 i don't know tulsi gabbard but hillary clinton said that tulsi gabbard is a russian agent
 i don't know jill stein
 she's a greenie and that's fine
 she's a greenie jill stein
 but jill stein was an agent of russia also
 these people are crazy
 now corrupt politicians nancy pelosi and adam schiff they are corrupt
 and nancy unlike kentucky which is doing great nancy ought stop wasting time go back to her district in san francisco help the homeless get rid of the drugs get rid of the needles that are lying all over the street and all of the things that are washing into the ocean through their storm sewer system
 what's happened is san francisco and what's happened to so many other places run by the radical left democrats it's unbelievable
 los angeles
 you take a look at los angeles looks like a third world city
 but go back to nancy's area look at what's happened
 there's been no place in the country that's gone down like the area that nancy pelosi represents
 and she's wasting all of her time
 and you know what it's backfiring
 you see it
 but the media and the democrats have launched an even more brazen assault on our nation with a deranged hyperpartisan impeachment witch-hunt
 impeachment
 think of it
 so today we just hit the highest number in the history of the stock market
 now that's hundreds of days
 so last week think of this in the history of our country it's never done better
 and by the way that's not rich that's not poor that's for everybody
 your 401s how you are doing
 pretty good right
 pretty good
 people tell me that their wives their husbands all of a sudden they've been running the 401s for years
 and they totally lost respect for let's say the husband totally lost respect
 now they think he's a financial genius because he's up 74
 she says darling i love you
 you are the most incredible brilliant financial mind
 and you know what if the democrats get in that's not going down by 50 that's going down to nothing
 it's going to be worthless
 it's going to be worthless
 you'll have a depression the likes of which you've never seen
 mark my words
 but hopefully we don't have to even think about it
 and that was going to happen here
 when we took over that was going down in the wrong direction
 and don't forget that was zero interest
 we're paying interest
 in other words people are now getting interest in their money
 but that was with zero interest real easy with zero interest
 last week the democrats voted to try and nullify the balance of 10s of millions of americans
 to be exact 63 million people disgracing themselves and bringing shame upon the house of representatives
 they've been plotting to overthrow the election since the first hour that we won
 and actually before we won they were plotting to overthrow this election
 before we won
 19 minutes after i took the oath of office that disgusting washington post look at all these people back there look
 fake news media
 it's the fake news
 look at all of them
 what they don't know is that when we hang it up in 5 years or 9 years or 13 years or maybe 17 years or maybe if i still have the strength 21 years
 see now they're going crazy
 now they're saying see i told you he was a dictator
 he wants to take charge in control of our country
 these people are crazy said
 the guy goes well we're going to fight and we're going to … no no
 he's going to win
 you know he's never leaving office don't you
 he's never going to leave office
 these people are crazy
 they're crazy
 but that disgusting newspaper that's right there the washington post declared the campaign to impeach president trump has just begun
 all right you can get them out
 be gentle be gentle
 be very gentle
 you know every time i say get them out of here i end up getting sued
 they say he hurt my arm
 all right
 so be very gentle please
 i don't want to get sued
 be very gentle
 very very gentle
 he's going home to mom
 thank you
 by the way do we love our law enforcement
 and in the whole world even on a monday night i like the monday nights because i think we're 58 and 0 that's a good record
 even for the wildcats that's a good
 we're 58 and 0 but even on a monday night is there anything cooler than being at a trump rally
 nothing can
 with last week's vote the far left has declared war on american democracy itself
 these people are lunatics
 in the face of these attacks republicans are the most unified that i've ever seen and i've been watching them and been a big part of them for a long time
 and the democrats have never witnessed anything like it and they know they're not going to win in 2020
 so let's see what can we do to win but that's not working too well
 you'll see
 the american people are fed up with democrat lies hoaxes slander
 the democrats outrageous conduct has created an angry majority that will vote the do nothing democrats the hell out of office soon
 tomorrow kentucky has a chance to send the radical democrats a message
 you will vote to reject democrats extremism socialism and corruption and you will vote to reelect kentucky governor matt bevin who's done a great job
 matt's a veteran
 he's a patriot
 he's done it all
 he's been a very very successful business leader
 he put his whole life at stake to help this state and the job he's done is incredible
 under his leadership kentucky has created over 57000 new jobs but i helped also
 we work together
 now he is difficult
 i have to say you know maybe because of the election but it's okay
 look he's such a pain when he needs something for kentucky like money like aid like he wants me to call one of the many manufacturers now that are coming into kentucky
 could you call the head of some company in japan please
 i say matt do i have to do it
 please please
 but isn't that really what you wanted in a governor
 that's what you want
 he's such a pain in the ass but that's what you want
 and the job he's done one of the best in the country
 not the best
 he's been incredible
 matt is strong on crime and tough on illegal immigration
 thank you
 he's pro-worker pro-life and 100 pro-second amendment
 by the way you're going to lose your second amendment if you vote in democrats
 you think i'm kidding
 i see what they're saying
 i watch what they're doing
 they're calling me all the time
 you will lose your second amendment as soon … i'm telling you
 as sure as you're standing here is anybody sitting
 nobody ever sits
 you can sit if you want
 no just stand
 you know what they say in the fake news
 look you've been standing
 nobody sat
 i don't know
 isn't that exciting
 nobody sat
 you know what they say
 no you know what they say
 they say trump only got one standing ovation
 because they stood at the beginning and they never sat down but they don't say the second part
 it's great
 great spirit
 you know why
 you love our country
 and you see what's happening
 we have turned this big monster ship
 we have turned it around
 and we need so badly
 you know it's like you plant a tree
 it takes a lot
 we have to get those roots to hold
 we have the best unemployment numbers in the history of our country so many things
 so many things
 the best employment numbers we have the best of everything
 and i think i'm going to count but i think it's like 118
 i told you we have a record stock market today
 i think about 100 … i'm going to have to check it
 because you know with the fake news if i'm off by half a point
 if it's 117 and not 118 even if i go under they report it
 they say he didn't tell the truth
 it was really 119
 but like a lot over 100 where we had the highest stock market in our history
 think of that
 that's incredible
 but matt bevin has made record investments in education spending for kentucky students
 education is so important to him
 matt bevin will defend your kentucky values
 he loves his state
 from an all out assault being waged on you from the extreme left
 not good
 i can't even imagine how can you vote for somebody from the extreme left
 this guy beshear is a major lefty
 you know that right
 why are we even … let's just have a good time
 are you sure we need an election tomorrow matt
 i don't know
 how does kentucky vote for a person … i'm telling you he will always vote for pelosi and schumer and shifty schiff
 how about this guy
 how about schiff
 he makes up a conversation
 he gets up before the united states congress
 he repeats my conversation with the head of the ukraine the new president a good guy repeats it
 i said i never said that
 he made a horrible statement
 it was a total lie
 and then i actually wanted to release the actual conversation
 and you haven't heard about the whistleblower after that have you
 because the whistleblower said lots of things that were so good folks you're going to find out
 but these are very dishonest people shifty schiff
 but matt's running against these people and we have to send them a sign because they're dangerous
 the radical left named andy beshear who rejects everything kentucky stands for
 that's who they want to win
 beshear has openly pledged to stop the policies of donald trump
 what are the policies
 take care of our vets take care of our military
 we want jobs
 we want companies to stop leaving us
 they're not leaving anymore
 you see companies aren't leaving anymore
 have you noticed
 remember years ago before i ever thought of doing this
 i mean when i said let's do this i said to our great now first lady
 i said melania let's give it a shot
 and then one by one we were doing good
 and what we've done if you remember before we ran companies were leaving kentucky they were leaving they will go into mexico
 they were going to china japan
 they were going all over
 any place but kentucky
 you don't read about that at all
 now they're all coming back
 they're all coming back
 but beshear wants to shut down your coal shut down your energy raise your taxes and take a giant wrecking ball to the greatest economy in the history of the state of kentucky
 the greatest economy you've ever had he's going to destroy it
 and it won't be long
 it'll go very quickly
 you know you're all sitting there
 everybody has good jobs
 you don't like it you go find another job
 it's like the choice i got from military
 i got you choice too
 if you don't like your job you find another one
 you tell the boss i am getting out of here i don't like this guy
 you go get a better job for more money
 beshear doesn't represent you
 he represents the washington swamp and he's backed by the same people trying to overthrow the last election
 beshear supported crooked hillary clinton and he's funded by the pro-abortion lobby and open borders fanatics
 open borders let everyone pour right in
 let them all pour right in
 beshear wants to bring sanctuary cities to kentucky think of that one
 releasing violent criminals and aliens to terrorize innocent kentucky families
 he wants sanctuary cities
 he hasn't learned what's happened
 we had a great election a couple of weeks ago in north carolina
 we won two house seats
 we were supposed to lose probably both of them
 we won them by a lot
 we won them by a lot
 and i think we won them because of the second amendment because it's under assault from democrats
 but i think we won also because of sanctuary cities
 because of bad news came out of sanctuary cities really bad
 and i think that was the reason we won both house seats by a lot
 beshear is too liberal too extreme and too dangerous for the state of kentucky
 tomorrow everybody needs to vote republican
 we got to go republican all the way
 i want to bring up a man and i'm serious about this
 this guy works so hard
 he's a great natural talent in business which you needed
 and he straightened it out
 and i'll tell you what he will be one of the truly greats in the history and maybe the greatest in the history of this state
 matt bevin come on up matt
 so we're also joined tonight by a very powerful man in washington your great senator mitch mcconnell
 nobody works harder for kentucky than mitch
 i will tell you nobody works harder and frankly maybe more importantly nobody works smarter
 it's up here
 i know a lot of people that work hard
 he works smart
 when the democrat arsonists in washington tried to destroy an innocent man named brett kavanaugh now justice brett kavanaugh mitch refused to cave to the left wing mob
 and that's what it was it was a mob
 there has never been a man treated so badly in washington as judge kavanaugh previously judge now justice
 we got him in and he's been great and he will be great
 mitch confirmed two tremendous supreme court justices
 mitch helped deliver the largest ever investment in our military and pass va choice and va accountability for our amazing veterans
 now i know mitch's opponent because they came here
 do you remember last year
 slightly different location and that's okay it was still the great state of kentucky
 because andy barr had amy mcgrath an extreme liberal against him
 andy barr is here with us tonight and we're going to introduce him but he beat her
 so she said to herself well you know i failed in congress now let's go for the senate
 she wanted to go to the house now she wants to go
 it's not going to work that way
 extreme liberal anti-gun lots of different things
 amy mcgrath compared my election think of this one … it's so insulting
 i shouldn't say it
 should i say it
 yeah why not
 no it's so insulting
 you know you work so hard you love your country so much and they get up to say things
 she compared it to 911 a slander upon our nation
 she wants open borders
 she supports the impeachment hoax witch hunt like nobody
 she wants to get rid of it
 she wasn't too happy with me last year
 we came in andy and we did a job on her and this is going to be easy
 she was caught telling donors democrats that she is further left than anyone in the history of the state of kentucky
 is that what you want
 it's not what you want
 so next november the state needs to defend its values and vote for a rock-ribbed kentucky conservative mitch mcconnell
 but we're going to get back to that later
 we'll be back many times
 we'll be back here many times
 mitch
 where is he
 so president obama left mitch and me and rand and all of us he left 142 openings for judges
 you're not supposed to allow any
 you don't do that
 you know they say the most important thing a president can do is federal judges right
 including the supreme court obviously
 i came in and i said how many do we have
 they said how many what sir
 i said judge openings
 and i thought they'd say none or one or two
 he said sir we have 142
 i said what
 i said tell me again
 he said we have 142
 so mitch and i and rand would like to thank very much president obama because nobody ever been so generous in their life
 also with us tonight is a great warrior and a great guy smart strong loves your state and he's really become a good friend of mine
 and i'll tell you he's a little bit different
 it's okay
 but whenever i've needed him whenever i needed him he was always there
 it's true
 i mean sometimes like i'd say  i don't need you to vote rand
 good
 and he'll vote his own way
 he's got that little libertarian touch
 that's okay
 that's okay
 but whenever we need and i'm not talking about me i'm talking about we we need a vote he's so incredible and he's become a really good friend
 i want to have him come up for a second
 rand paul your senator a great warrior
 wow that was excellent
 whoa
 wow thank you
 thank you very much rand
 great job
 he's a warrior
 he's a warrior i've always said it
 also with us tonight are representatives from your state that are fantastic a couple from outside your state but we'll welcome them also right
 but these are also great fighters great warriors
 hal rogers
 thank you hal
 brett guthrie
 thank you brett
 thomas massey
 man we just spoke about won a great grace andy barr
 james comer
 james great
 and from an incredible state that we won 2016 that crooked hillary said she's going to win that state didn't come too close at winning that state
 it's a great state and we love the people of north carolina
 congressman mark meadows
 along with some of your local great politicians and a person that's done a really spectacular job
 you know in michigan a woman she just kept going she just kept going
 reminded me by the way of your governor from the standpoint she never quit
 now republicans hadn't won michigan in many many years
 she called could you come again
 could you do it again
 could you come make another speech please
 i said all right this is the last one
 no no no
 how about a couple of more
 and then bill clinton actually told hillary clinton you better get going something's going on in michigan
 you're going to lose michigan
 you better start going
 no no no
 the polls say everything's good
 and we won the great state of michigan for the first time in many years
 and i said when it came time to picking the republican party chair head of the rnc i said i got to get the woman from michigan ronna mcdaniel to head it up
 and when they were saying how sophisticated hillary clinton's campaign was … you know we're not sophisticated right
 i don't think so
 remember all during the … well she's got the finest computer technology in the world
 yeah she paid for it but she didn't get it
 she has really fantastic geniuses
 but i had somebody that was a lot better than the people that she had
 his name was brad parscale and he's here with us
 campaign manager
 doing a great job
 and our numbers are looking very good
 but think of it we're one day short of a year now
 can you believe it
 less than a year
 it begins november 3rd this time
 we had that great great date oh boy november 8th remember
 was there ever a day like that in television history
 and they have no idea because when we do hang it up they're all out of business
 they know that
 that's why i think that we will get … i expect to get a full hearty unbelievable endorsement very soon from the failing new york times and from the amazon washington post
 you know before the election started about a month before i announced that i was going to do this i said i'm going to become a politician
 i can't believe it
 i'm going to become a politician
 but i looked at the new york times and it was like a little leaflet that you hand out at a grocery store right
 the wind would blow it away
 it was dead
 i call it the failing new york times only because eventually it will fail
 but we built it up
 they do stories … in my entire life i had a few stories on the front page of the new york times and now if i have three or four a day it's like why are they not covering me anymore
 and they're all bad
 they can take what we did two weeks ago with the number one terrorist in the world and they make it look as bad as possible
 in fact i love dogs but they gave the dog full credit
 they didn't give me any credit
 that's okay
 the dog got the credit and the dog will be coming very shortly by the way to the white house
 but they'll be endorsing us
 and you know all of these crazy like cnn with its bad ratings there goes its red light it just went off
 their red light just went off
 see how it is
 well it's hard
 look put yourself in their position
 they have it on their covering and now they know they're ready to get hit so they turn it off
 i mean i can't blame them
 their red light just went off
 no but put yourself in cnn's position
 without us … you know cable was not supposed to be a good business then we came along
 it's not me it's we
 they came from the valleys they came from everywhere the cities they came from places they're still trying to figure out where the hell did all those people come from
 it's true
 a great senator from tennessee they have early voting and i was in pennsylvania making a speech and he saw me because he had a couple of great congressman friends from pennsylvania and he said you know in tennessee we have very early voting and i just left and i've been doing this for 24 years
 and i got to be honest with you i've never seen so many people vote
 and these are people they love our country they're incredible they work hard but they never liked what they were voting for so they really wouldn't vote
 sounds terrible
 but they didn't like anything that they saw
 they say sir i'm seeing people and he said this come out from the valleys come out from the mountains come out from areas that they've never come out
 we have lines that are five blocks long at every voting booth and parlor
 he said i can't speak for the rest of the country but if the rest of the countries like tennessee you're going to have the greatest victory in the history of our nation
 and that's what happened
 that was a great statement
 that was a great statement from people from a great state also
 tomorrow you must elect the entire republican ticket from governor on down including your next lieutenant governor ralph alvarado
 ralph alvarado
 great ralph
 you're a good man
 and your next attorney general daniel cameron
 should i bring daniel up
 get up here daniel come on
 here's a star
 here's a star
 mr
 president i hope you can tell that kentucky is trump country
 we are proud to stand with you on pro-life issues and here in the commonwealth we are going to stand up for those who cannot speak for themselves
 and mr
 president we are going to stand with you in protecting the second amendment rights of all kentuckians
 and mr
 president i make a personal commitment to you as the next attorney general we are going to make sure that kentucky is never a sanctuary state
 good
 that's good
 thank you daniel
 thank you daniel
 star
 a star is born
 a star is born
 did you ever see that movie a star is born
 thank you daniel
 great
 you're next secretary of state michael adams
 thanks michael
 auditor mark harmon
 thank you mark
 treasurer allison ball
 she's doing great
 and agriculture commissioner ryan quarles
 with the help of everyone here america is the hottest economy anywhere in the world by far
 foreign leaders come in to see me congratulations on your economy
 china's doing poorly as you know but they're paying us billions and billions and billions of dollars and they've never given us 25 cents before
 billions of dollars
 they gave a lot of that money to our farmers who got targeted but no longer
 they're back buying from our farmers
 but we've created 6
7 million new jobs since the election
 and if i would have ever said that during the campaign the fake news back there would have never let me hear the end of it
 think of that 6
7
 and today just today a record 158 million americans are now employed the highest level of employment in our country's history
 african american unemployment just dropped to the lowest level ever recorded in the history of our country
 hispanic american and asian american unemployment rates have also reached the all time historic lows
 the history of our country
 hourly earnings listen to this are up 9 since the election
 nobody ever thought that was going to be happening
 under the previous two administrations we lost 60000 factories
 i thought that was a typo
 i said how the hell can you lose 60000
 it turned out to be right
 and you know how i know
 because i've been saying it for two years and they never corrected me
 it's true two years
 i get a call sometimes from the people in the campaign sir
 sir we have an emergency
 what's the emergency
 somebody's calling from the media the fake news
 did you put a comma in the wrong location sir
 because they consider it to be a front page story
 okay
 under my administration we've added nearly 10000 new factories and many many more thousands of factories are coming into our country
 we reversed it
 to get relief to working families we passed massive tax cuts massive
 to lift up distressed communities our tax law created opportunity zones
 tim scott of south carolina was so involved including 144 designated by your great governor
 by the way the other governor
 i don't think … well i don't know
 you know
 he's not going to do so well
 he'll be calling for a meeting and i won't be able to see him because i don't like him very much
 but i like this one very much and we're going to help him
 we slashed a record number of job-killing regulations
 we ended the war on american energy
 we're now the largest producer of energy anywhere in the world
 and we ended the war on beautiful clean coal
 i announced the withdrawal of the united states from the horrible costly one-sided paris climate accord
 ask them how they're doing in paris with it
 not too good
 i canceled the so called clean power plan and repealed obama's federal coal moratorium
 we're putting our great miners back to work
 on trade we're starting to set records every week we're reversing decades of washington disloyalty stupidity and corruption
 past administrations did nothing as china looted our factories and stole up to 500 billion of american dollars
 by the way people can't even believe it
 not 500 million
 that's a lot
 if you lost 500 million that's a lot
 i thought that was another typo
 500 billion they would take a year from us
 we rebuilt china
 and i give them a lot of credit by the way i give china
 what i don't give credit to is obama and past administrations beyond obama i don't give them credit because they let it happen
 they should have never let it happen
 but now we're taking in tens of billions and billions and billions of dollars
 just recently very slow slippy joe … biden that is said of china's piracy and plunder they're not that bad folks
 he always used the word folks
 i watched him today he used the word folks
 hi folks
 hi
 hi my time is up
 i got to leave
 no they have him all freaked out because he makes a mistake every time he speaks
 so i can just see these handlers because they're handlers like they use on horses they're handlers right
 all right get him off now
 he's been up there long enough
 so they're screaming get off get off
 sleepy joe get off the stage please
 please joe you're doing fine
 joe you're doing fine
 you're doing fine
 and then he goes i love being in ohio but he was in iowa yesterday
 yes sir
 and they say dammit he should have left sooner we told him
 get off the stage sleepy joe
 sleepy joe get off the damn stage
 but he said about sleepy joe about china they're not that bad folks
 they're not really competition for us
 no they're not
 500 billion a year right
 he did nothing in eight years him and obama
 in fact i'm here because of them when you think about it
 right
 just thinking
 i'm here because of them
 kellyanne conway stand up kellyanne
 stand up
 another warrior
 i just saw kellyanne
 i said stand up
 no but think of it as somebody saying that
 now look 1
5 billion that hunter who got thrown out of the navy who had no experience who had not anything got a lot of money from ukraine but he got 1
5 billion from china i got to tell you i've been negotiating with china they're very tough
 china
 i got to tell you i've been negotiating with china
 they're very tough
 that is not the same group of chinese people that i've been negotiating with
 they gave him 1
5 billion
 he'll make millions and millions with that
 and how about saying by the way mr
 president would you please take over the negotiations that president trump is no longer handling
 guess what
 you would be sold down the tubes so fast and we're so close
 china wants to make a deal so badly
 i think they'd love to see another president
 they would like to see another president more than crooked hillary would okay
 can you imagine if they ever took over negotiations of this deal which is going to be one of the greatest deals ever made
 has to be because we started down here and they were up there
 has to be
 can you imagine if they ever took over negotiations
 this is what china would love more than anything else
 it's not going to happen folks because we can't let our country go back to hell
 we can't do it
 we can't let it happen
 because the bidens got rich while america was robbed and let me tell you the fake news will not put it in
 i watched the last debate and this weakling named anderson cooper saying well it's totally unsubstantiated mr
 biden solely answer
 what's unsubstantiated
 he is on tape doing a real quid pro quo
 sure it's totally unsubstantiated sir
 i've never seen anything like it
 could you imagine if i did what he did
 could you imagine if don jr
 or eric trump walked out of china while i was let's say vice president or president
 let's say they walked out of china with 1
5 billion
 do you think the press would be saying well it's unsubstantiated
 no it's something
 let me just tell you something
 these people not all of them but these people are very dishonest people
 very very dishonest
 but under this administration the great betrayal is over
 america is not for sale
 and we're more determined than ever to drain the swamp and that's what we're doing with these crazy people
 a lot of bad things happened and a lot of bad things i think are going to be revealed because there's no way we can allow them to get away with what they would have with a normal person gotten away with
 let's face it
 these are bad people
 thanks to my tariffs we will soon have over 100 billion from a country that didn't want to do anything with us
 and i'll tell you they started buying our farm product
 you see that
 they started buying a lot of our product even before the deals are done
 last year i got our farmers 16 billion because they were targeted
 and the year before i got them 12 billion
 i just took them out of the tariffs and we had a lot leftover
 and i said congratulations farmers
 i love you
 i love our farmers
 they love me
 that's why they did they targeted our farmers
 i said congratulations
 that's compliments of china
 and they do
 they want to make a deal so badly
 frankly honestly they want to make a deal a lot more than i want to make a deal
 that's the way it is
 because we're doing very well right now with china
 we're replacing the nafta disaster with the us mexico canada agreement
 a huge win for kentucky farmers for kentucky auto workers for kentucky manufacturers
 unfortunately nancy pelosi so far and the do nothing democrats don't want to give the people of our country a victory
 it's really let it be a bipartisan deal
 i don't care
 it's such an incredible deal for this country and nafta was one of the worst deals ever made
 democrats need to pass the us mca
 we need their votes
 otherwise you can't pass it
 and it's up to pelosi who has to put it forward but she's too busy wasting their time
 so either pass it or go back to san francisco and clean up your mess
 the obama biden's administration's trans-pacific partnership would have dealt the death blow to the american auto industry
 that would have been one of the great catastrophes
 my first week in office i canceled that job-killing travesty
 you know all about it
 under our policies just days ago ford and the uaw announced a 1 billion investment in louisville
 1 billion
 before my election our leaders used the great american middle-class as a piggy bank to fund their delusional global projects
 they were globalists
 i was elected to be president of the united states not president of the globe
 they decimated american manufacturing to promote economic growth in foreign countries
 tell me how is that good
 they try and convince you it's good
 i was a very good student
 i'm a very like we're all smart
 we sit back we listen and i say these people are something wrong with them
 only in kentucky can somebody be so precise
 you're right about you are right about that
 they deployed our military to protect immensely wealthy nations subsidizing their welfare states with your money
 the money we spend on other country's militaries but it's coming down
 and i'm telling other countries i'm sorry you're going to have to pay now
 i'm sorry
 pay
 pay
 pay you got to pay
 and they poured precious american blood and treasure into the middle east while our great cities fell into decay and disrepair
 we go in for internet
 we want rural we'll bring it in
 and we're bringing 5g into places like kentucky that haven't been properly served
 we're bringing it in all over the middle west all over the country
 and we're really ahead of schedule
 we're doing really well
 people will be very surprised soon when some numbers come out but we're doing very well
 but you were very much underserved for years
 and yet we're investing billions and billions of dollars in places you've never even heard of
 doesn't make sense does it
 but after years of rebuilding other nations we are finally rebuilding our nation
 we are finally putting america first
 yet the deep state and the failed ruling class are trying to resist any changes to their failed policies of the past
 they believe it is their right to rule over you and to redistribute your wealth all around the world
 no thank you
 no thank you
 that's why we ended the paris accord
 that's why… we've ended a lot
 i don't even want to tell you
 but the sellout of the american nation ended the day i took the oath of office and you understand that
 past leaders transform far away nations into chaotic war zones
 then they demanded that america accept unlimited migration from those terror afflicted regions
 take the people take the people
 we defeated isis
 we
 when i took over three years ago when we took over when i took over isis was all over
 i defeated isis
 i didn't even know to what extent
 i was watching the other night the great lou dobbs and he said when trump took over president trump he used to say trump is a great president
 then he said trump is the greatest president since ronald reagan
 then he said no no trump is an even better president than ronald reagan
 and now he's got me down as the greatest president in the history of our country including george washington and abraham lincoln
 thank you
 we love you too
 but we didn't fight them over there only to invite them over here
 we didn't do that
 we're not doing that
 you see what we're going and you see what we're doing and you see it's never easy because i get hit by the swamp 15 different ways but it doesn't matter
 we're doing the right thing to protect our communities
 my administration implemented the travel ban on some of the world's most dangerous countries
 a lot of people were against it
 they said isn't that terrible
 countries that have crime rates that are so high you wouldn't even believe it's possible and we have a travel ban now
 we don't take people from those countries
 i'm sorry
 and we won a historic victory on the travel ban in the united states supreme court ruled it totally constitutional
 on no issue have democrats more totally betrayed you than on immigration
 democrats want open borders
 they want to give illegal aliens free healthcare free education more advantages than our own citizens have and more benefits than our own military gets
 in the republican party we believe taking care of our own citizens first is paramount
 thanks to our tireless efforts to secure our southern border illegal crossings have dropped 60 since may
 the wall is being built
 it's going up rapidly
 it's got a big impact
 and i want to thank mexico
 we have 27000 mexican soldiers on our border policing our border because the democrats will not do anything to end loopholes
 it would take us 15 minutes and we could end the loopholes
 think of the word loopholes
 they don't want to end the loophole
 if you want to keep violent criminal aliens out of your communities you have only one choice tomorrow and that's to vote for matt bevin
 democrats are becoming more extreme and militant by the day
 the democrat's planned government takeover of healthcare would obliterate medicare
 what are they doing
 i will always protect medicare for our nation's seniors
 it's going to be protected
 what they're doing is crazy
 and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions
 and we will also protect you with preexisting physicians
 how about that
 preexisting physicians
 first time i've ever said that just thought of that
 true
 because under their plan you don't get your own doctor
 you know what you get
 whatever the hell you get
 that's what you get
 oh great doc fix me up doc
 you mean you want to work on my heart
 who are you doc
 i don't think so
 thanks to our campaign to combat the opioid epidemic with your governor's help we have seen a 17 drop in overdose deaths in kentucky which is a record
 democrats have also waged an unrelenting assault against people of faith
 anybody in here a person of faith
 great people
 the last administration threatened adoption and foster care agencies purely for their religious beliefs
 last week my administration took action to stop that obama era assault
 it was an assault
 and governor matt bevin is a national leader on behalf of vulnerable children and there is no better leader than him what he has done
 and together we're fighting for american orphans foster families and the sacred rights of religious believers
 and he's done a fantastic job
 virtually every top democrat also now supports late term abortion ripping babies straight from their mother's womb right up until the moment of birth
 and that's why i've asked congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from god
 democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion socialism and blatant corruption
 the republican party is the party of the american worker the american family the american dream and it's the party of the great abraham lincoln
 we forgot that
 abraham lincoln
 the incredible rebuilding of our military includes over 100 billion investments all across the state of kentucky
 i withdrew our nation from the horrible one sided iran nuclear deal
 it's not the same country
 when i came in that country there were in 18 different sites of confliction they called it
 and now they're a little different a little different
 we'll see what happens with iran
 and i recognize israel's true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem
 for years you watched as your politicians apologized for america
 remember
 he'd go around oh thank you so much
 he wouldn't apologize to you but he apologized to others
 now you have a president who is standing up for america and we are standing up for the people of kentucky
 the next step to victory begins tomorrow and it begins with all of you
 you have to do this
 look maybe you'll be late for work
 maybe you'll be late for whatever
 i don't want to know everything
 some things i don't want to know but you have to just put it off
 you have to go vote
 it's so important
 tomorrow is so because beyond even the governorship and it's so important
 because again your state is setting records
 in the history of your state you've never done this well economically job wise unemployment employment factories moving in new factories open expansion of your car plants
 you've never done this well but you're sending that big message to the rest of the country
 it's so important
 you got to get your friends you got to vote
 because if you lose it sends a really bad message
 it just sends a bad and they will build it up
 here's the story
 if you win they're going to make it like ho hum
 and if you lose they're going to say trump suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the world
 this was the greatest
 you can't let that happen to me
 and you know what
 you can't let that happen to your incredible state kentucky
 you can't let that happen
 that would be a disaster for yourself because you'd be losing an incredible governor
 but you're going to have a great victory tomorrow
 with your support you have to go out and vote
 we will show the corrupt democrats that the american people are not backing down and we will never ever back down
 so tomorrow we need you to go out and get your friends get your family get your neighbors
 get out and vote for governor matt bevin and all of these great republicans
 with your help we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity
 together we will elect a republican congress
 2020 we're going to re-elect because of their stupidity
 these people are on the run and i will campaign in every one of those states that were so corrupt if they raise their hand
 and don't forget
 out of 194 we got 194 not one republican left us last week
 and two republicans think of that
 and the other three couldn't get there because of but they were votes
 they said they were totally votes had airport problems
 i said you can't do that
 airport problems
 but then we had the democrats
 we picked up two democrats so we had bipartisan support
 that's unusual
 i always say because they're lousy politicians they've got lousy policy but they do stick together
 that's about it
 we will elect a republican congress in 2020
 and we'll have a great speaker of the house in kevin
 we're going to create a fair safe sane and lawful system of immigration
 we'll enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with those beautiful words made in the usa
 we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending listen to this the aids epidemic in america within less than 10 years
 we've already started
 who would have felt we could have done that
 we've started
 in the past administration toward the end we had certain things that we could have done
 they didn't do anything
 they didn't do anything but we did
 we have it all funded and we started think of that aids within 10 years will be out of this country
 nobody would have thought that was possible
 we will end it
 great great
 i came into my office they were telling me about the breakthroughs that have been made
 it's incredible what they're doing
 and don't forget right to try by the way where somebody who's terminally ill can now use our medicines which they were never allowed to in the past
 so instead of traveling to asia and europe and all over the world or going home hopeless and dying they can now use what we call right to try
 we have the greatest doctors the greatest drugs greatest labs in the world
 they can now go and try
 and we are having unbelievable success
 unbelievable
 right to try
 we will chart a new era of discovery in space and someday soon we will land on believe it or not the surface of the moon only to go to mars
 you know i said we've done the moon
 no they say sir we land on the moon to go to mars and that's what we're doing with the moon
 and we are really really advanced
 it's moving along rapidly
 we will defend privacy free speech free assembly religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms
 and above all we will never stop fighting for the cherished values that bind us together as one america
 we support protect and defend the constitution of the united states
 we stand with the incredible heroes and warriors of law enforcement
 we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life
 we believe that faith and family not government and bureaucracy are the true american way
 we believe that children should be taught to love our country honor our history and always respect our great american flag
 loyal citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country
 we are returning power to you the american people
 the great state of kentucky was settled by some of the most devoted and courageous people ever to walk on the face of the earth
 these tough pioneer men and strong pioneer women braved the wilderness and defied the danger to build a life and to build a home
 they didn't have a lot of money
 they didn't have a lot of luxury
 but they all had one thing in common
 they love their families they love their country and they love their god
 these proud kentucky patriots did not shed their blood sweat and tears so that we could sit at home while others try to erase their legacy and destroy their magnificent heritage
 our allegiance is to our nation
 our loyalty is to our citizens
 and our devotion is to our creator
 for the sake of our freedom for the sake of our children we are going to keep on working
 we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning winning winning
 we are one movement
 we are one people
 we are one family and one glorious nation under god
 america is thriving like never before
 and ladies and gentlemen of kentucky the best is yet to come
 together we will make america wealthy again

 and we will make america great again
 thank you kentucky
