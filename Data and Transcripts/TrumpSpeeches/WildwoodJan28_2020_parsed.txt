thank you
 thank you
 i love new jersey and i'm thrilled to be back right here in the garden state
 thank you
 the garden state
 together we're achieving historic victories for new jersey families
 you see it every single day
 the new jersey unemployment rate has reached the lowest of all time
 more people are working today in the state of new jersey than ever before
 i have to tell you more people almost 160 million are working right now in the united states
 that's the highest level of employment in the history of our country
 a lot of countries aren't doing so well just so you understand
 tomorrow we will replace the nafta nightmare one of the worst trade deals ever in history with the incredible brand new us-mexico-canada agreement the usmca
 a massive win for new jersey workers new jersey farmers new jersey union people new jersey manufacturers and everybody
 weeks ago we also signed a fantastic new trade agreement with china that will boost new jersey exports and defend new jersey jobs
 250 billion coming in
 oh that's going to be so nice
 we're restoring america's industrial might like never before
 they're all coming back
 they want to be where the action is
 after years of devastating defense cuts we have fully rebuilt the united states military
 thanks to the incredible courage of our warriors the greatest warriors in the world the isis caliphate has been totally destroyed and its savage founder and leader al-baghdadi is dead
 weeks ago at my direction the us military launched a flawless precision strike that killed the world's number one terrorist qasem soleimani
 soleimani was responsible for murdering and wounding thousands of americans and actively planning new attacks but we stopped him cold
 yet washington democrats like crazy bernie sanders and nervous nancy pelosi they opposed our action to save american lives
 they oppose it
 they oppose it
 you know the roadside bombs that you see hurting our people and lots of other people so badly
 the legs the arms wiped out
 no legs no arms
 soleimani loved that
 that was his weapon of choice
 we didn't like him
 he's not around anymore
 well we are creating jobs and killing terrorists the congressional democrats are obsessed with demented hoaxes crazy witch hunts and deranged partisan crusades
 it's all they know how to do
 the do nothing democrats
 they have spent the last three years and probably even before i came down on that beautiful escalator with our beautiful future first lady trying to overthrow the last election
 we will make sure that they face another crushing defeat in the next election
 we are going to have a victory that's even greater than 2016
 this november we are going to win back the house we are going to hold the senate and we are going to keep the white house
 the american people are disgusted by the washington democrat … you see it
 you see it
 which is worse the impeachment hoax or the witch hunts from russia
 but we're going to be signing up millions and millions of registered independents democrat voters
 today i had the best polls that i've ever had since being elected
 the best we've ever had
 remember i used to go over polls
 but i only used to talk about them when i was doing well otherwise i wouldn't
 we had our best polls
 americans of all political beliefs are sick and tired of the radical rage filled left socialists
 i never saw anything … what's going on in this country … what's going on in this country really the democrat party is the socialist party and maybe worse
 voters are making a mass exodus from that party and we are welcoming them to the republican party with wide open arms
 the republican party is doing great
 we are privileged to be joined tonight by a courageous leader who left the democrat party because he has had enough of their extremism enough of their socialism and enough of their vile hoaxes and scams
 he's had enough
 i tell you he really is he's a brave guy
 he just said  i'm not doing it
 i'm not doing it
 it's a hoax it's a scam i'm not doing it
 we called him you're our kind of guy
 let's go
 it didn't take much because he believes like we do
 we are truly honored to be here with the newest republican member of the house of representatives your great congressman jeff van drew
 i have to tell you a few weeks ago jeff was one of the few brave and principled democrat lawmakers in all fairness we've been after him for a longtime who stood up to the house democrats and the outrageous abusive power that you see going on right now
 they can't win an election so they're trying to steal an election
 it's not happening folks
 it's not happening
 jeff had the guts to defy the left-wing fanatics in his own party and to stand tall in defense of our constitution our freedom and democracy itself
 i just want to … i have to tell you i've gotten to know him really well over the last couple of weeks
 he's a great guy he's a brave guy he shares our values
 he supports lower taxes not bad
 they want to raise your taxes
 how did that work jeff
 how did you get elected with that one
 less regulation a strong national defense
 he loves our military loves our vets and police
 he is a tireless champion for the state of new jersey
 he loves your second amendment which is under siege by the democrats
 jeff it's an honor to be with you
 please please
 thank you
 thank you man
 we have tens of thousands of people outside
 if anybody would like to give them your place please let us know but we have thousands and thousands
 tens of thousands
 jeff gave me a number he said 175000 people signed up
 is that a fact
 175
 i think he's on his way
 i think he's on his way
 thank you jeff great job
 thank you jeff
 thank you jeff
 it's been a little bit of a story
 you see the fakers back there
 fake news
 fake
 you know if another candidate has 1000 people they say he spoke to a massive crowd
 if they have 10000 like pocahontas went into central park in new york
 this young men could have 10000 people you know that in central park
 she had 10000 people like in central park
 i said what's the big deal
 they made it oh the crowds are so large
 jeff just told you he had 175000 people sign up
 seriously you have to see outside
 they know because they have to follow they're trailers
 i call them trailers
 but they're fake
 they're fake
 they're not honest
 let me just tell you so here's the story so we have these massive crowds that fill up stadiums every single time
 we have tens of thousands of people outside
 they never mention it
 they never mention it so maybe they will tonight
 but that's an all-time record
 this is not a brand new place and unfortunately it holds 10000 people or less
 we set the all-time record
 you know why
 because for games … see the floor packed with people
 for games you're playing ice hockey or basketball so we broke the all-time record in this house
 it's a wonderful house in a wonderful community
 also in wildwood like we're in the middle of winter
 there is nobody in the middle of winter and it's a great place in the summer
 those streets are packed all the way back to the airplane practically
 but on june 2nd everybody has to do us all a favor
 number one you have to get out and vote republican
 get rid of these clowns
 you have to get out and vote for really a brave man
 what he did was incredible
 jeff van drew what he did was incredible
 get out and vote
 he's going to have a big victory
 he's going to have a big victory
 we're grateful to have with us this evening some wonderful friends of mine people that i've known forever your former governor who did a terrific job chris christie
 chris
 great chris great job
 your wonderful republican state chairman doug steinhardt what a job he's doing
 thank you doug
 thank you doug
 my campaign's two great new jersey co-chairs and i think we'll play for the state … you know they all say republicans can't win
 tell me why
 they said should you move this to the meadowlands
 i said no i want to be in south jersey
 we want to be with our friends
 but we could have filled up the meadowlands arena two or three times
 maybe we'll do it during the summer
 should we do it during the summer
 maybe
 but two brave guys two great politicians
 people that love our state
 state senators mike testa and joe pennacchio
 joe pennacchio
 thank you joe
 thank you
 thank you
 two incredible new jersey natives you've never heard of kellyanne conway have you say something
 thank you kellyanne
 i just want to thank republicans because what they've been doing is incredible
 republican leadership in this country we're winning winning winning like never before
 we're winning again and we've got a party that's a very different part a much stronger party a much more inclusive party
 we have a party that we love
 we have a party that has the votes
 we have a party like they've never had before
 the republican party respected again
 i have to say this america is winning again and america is thriving again like never before
 since the election we have created seven million new jobs
 the average unemployment rate under my administration is lower than any previous administration listen to this one in united states history
 that's a good fact the lowest in history
 thank you man
 we have a great veteran up here and he said we love you
 we love you
 the veterans
 are we doing good for the veterans
 thank you
 african american hispanic american and asian american unemployment rates have reached the lowest levels ever recorded in the history of our country
 ever recorded
 women's unemployment is at a 65 year low
 sorry about that
 soon it's going to be historic
 another couple of good months it'll be historic
 65 years for women
 in the eight years before i took office over 300000 working age people left the workforce
 they had no choice
 in just three years of my administration 3
5 million people have joined the workforce
 nobody believes it including the fake … the workforce
 nobody believes it including the fake news
 if i would have said that during the campaign that we were going to produce numbers like this the fakeness would have been hitting me
 he's exaggerating
 he's lying pinocchio pinocchio
 the press is very dishonest
 more than two million millennials have gotten jobs and their wages have grown by nearly 5 every year which is a record
 a record number of americans between the ages of 25 and 34 are now working another record
 under the trump economy the lowest paid earners are reaping the fastest gains of anybody
 you don't hear that because this is a blue collar boom
 it's very nice
 it's about time
 it's about time
 it's been many many decades
 earnings for the bottom 10 are rising faster than earnings for the top 10 first time ever
 since my election the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased listen to this by 47 three times faster than the increase for the top 1
 median household income is at an all time high
 for president bush in eight years it was 450 over eight years
 think of this for a second
 under president barack hussein obama for eight years it was 975 so eight years eight years 450 975 under your favorite president and when you include the tax cuts the regulation cuts that nobody's ever cut taxes like this
 nobody's ever cut regulations
 that's why all these jobs are being built
 under president trump for three years the number is almost 10000 and that's three years and it's going up
 it's going up very substantial
 that's a big difference
 new business applications in new jersey have just soared to a record high and we have lifted 10 million people nationwide off federal welfare
 they're off
 they are off federal welfare
 nobody would've believed these numbers
 someday they're going to write the true story
 our child tax credit alone is delivering 2200 a year to 40 million american families
 we have ended so importantly for you the war on american energy
 the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world
 we don't need anybody else's energy anymore
 it's so nice
 what happened in the last three years with energy is incredible but extreme liberals in washington want to shut down u
s
 energy including through the so-called green new deal
 close your factories
 get rid of your cows
 you don't have too many cows in wildwood but if you do they're gone
 we will never sacrifice america's energy independence
 took us a long time to get there and we really picked it up over the last three years
 what we've done is incredible pipelines all over
 pipelines are good
 they're underground they're good environmentally sound
 to lift up forgotten communities that need investment the most
 these are the communities that really have suffered
 we created with the help of a great gentleman from the state of south carolina you know who i'm talking about
 tim scott right
 senator tim scott he's an incredible guy
 he really is
 he came to my office and he had this idea that he's wanted to do for a long time
 senator tim scott opportunity zones and jobs and investment are now pouring into nearly 170 newly designated opportunity zones right here in new jersey all over the united states
 billions and billions and billions of dollars and not government dollars they're flowing into the opportunities zones into areas where investment was dead
 for decades politicians ran for office promising to protect american workers but then they went to washington and they lined their pockets with special address cash and they shipped american jobs and dreams to other countries
 they closed up your factories
 they got rid of your jobs
 they didn't have to pay taxes
 globalist politicians lowered our economic defenses and allowed other nations to rob our factories steal our farms and ransack our communities
 not anymore not anymore because we are defenseless no more because long last you have a president who puts america first
 is that okay
 the united states laws listen to this number and you know if it was wrong the fake news would be all over me and i've been saying it for three years
 the united states lost 60000 factories and plants
 think of that
 you wouldn't think that's possible because of stupid trade deals because of bad leadership
 during the 16 years of the two prior administrations under just three years my administration has now added 12000 new factories and many more are being built and they're pouring back into the united states because that's where the action is
 that's where they want to be
 they are pouring back into our country new plants and factories
 you see them all over
 i passed two of them coming in brand new beautiful plants and factories
 they're pouring back in
 this is where the action is
 this is where they want to be
 i see the leaders they say it's incredible what happened to your country
 i said don't tell me that
 we want you to have your companies build plants in new jersey and other places and that's what's happening
 but on no issue have washington democrats thoroughly betrayed the american people than the issue of immigration
 left-wing radical politician support deadly sanctuary cities and remember a sanctuary city is a jurisdiction that refuses to hand over criminal aliens that are in local law enforcement custody
 instead they order them to be released into your community
 what the hell is going on
 what is going on
 once set loose these criminal aliens are free to continue their crimes spree against innocent americans
 right here in new jersey your state's democrat leaders have instituted sanctuary policies that result in dangerous predators being set free into your community
 for example cumberland county we all know cumberland county very well right
 good luck with this one
 they released an illegal alien criminal with multiple charges for sexual assault of a child
 he is now at large free to search for another innocent victim
 they didn't want to give him to ice and i want to thank ice because the abuse they take and the incredible job they do
 right here another criminal alien was arrested for a violent assault in new jersey
 the sanctuary jurisdiction of middlesex county defied the ice request to detain him
 local authorities released him and he went on to commit a gruesome triple murder
 i could read these cases honestly i could read and state these cases to you all night
 i could state these cases to you all night
 no american should ever be hurt harmed or killed because left-wing politicians democrats decided to shield and shelter… look look wait
 you have criminals that are on the streets that should be in jail
 you have criminals that on the street that should be taken the hell out of our country and brought back to where they came from
 by the way ice has removed thousands upon thousands of ms-13 gang members the most brutal people
 you don't want to do that job
 maybe you do a couple of tough people up there
 anybody want to be with ice
 you got a lot of tough people in new jersey
 new jersey is different
 i think new jersey is different
 no but these ice people they love our country
 they're proud and they're tough people and they'll go right into a pack
 they call it a pack and they start swinging
 everyone's swinging or they end up standing up
 that's the end of that and you know what they do
 they bring the ms-13 and many other gang members and other members back to el salvador back to honduras back to guatemala back to mexico
 i want to thank mexico because you know what's happening right
 thousands and thousands at this moment 27000 soldiers from mexico protecting our southern border
 i want to thank the president
 democrats stand for crime corruption and chaos
 republicans stand for law order and justice and say what you want but those are the facts
 we are removing these illegal criminals and gang members
 we are literally taking them by so many thousands and thousands and we're bringing him back
 thanks to our tireless efforts of border patrol to secure our border we have reduced illegal border crossings seven straight months in a row
 we have the numbers down by 75 since spring 75
 we have ended catch and release and really look i had another party
 i could get anything
 if i wanted to spend money on anything look with the military we got two trillion dollars right
 more
 two trillion all made in america right
 everything
 best planes best missiles best everything made in america
 if i wanted to build anything the only thing they put the whole weight of their party they didn't want us to have the wall
 they knew it worked
 many of them voted five years ago for a wall
 they just didn't know how to get it built
 i do
 but what happened is through a series of court cases and other things the money has won and we are now building that beautiful wall and this powerful border wall is going up at record speed and we just reached over 100 miles of wall and by next year we'll be over 400 miles and shortly thereafter it will be complete
 a lot of people were saying a year ago he didn't build the wall yet
 he didn't build the wall
 let me tell you
 when you have the strength of a party that has the house okay hopefully they're not going to have the house for long
 we'll have a wonderful new speaker will get rid of nancy pelosi nervous nancy nervous nancy
 we'll have kevin mccarthy who's been fantastic
 we have to win back the house
 but think of this
 the wall so many people were saying build it
 well it's not easy when you have the weight of an entire party and they control the house not easy
 we did it and frankly we were building the wall through the help of the military the army corps of engineers anyway but you know what
 now we actually have the money and it's going up very rapidly
 in all due respect to mexico we like mexico very much and we've gotten along great with mexico and the president's a friend of mine and i think he's doing a fantastic job
 it's a tough situation
 but mexico is in fact you will soon find out paying for the wall
 okay
 they'd hit you with that
 now the wall is ultimately and very nicely being paid for by mexico and it's an advantage for mexico too when you think about it
 the wall is a vital barrier for blocking deadly drugs from pouring into these communities
 what we're doing is stopping drugs at a record number
 it's still anything that comes over is too much but we're blocking it at a record number
 i'm also very proud to report that we won a critical supreme court victory yesterday on immigration
 we will now be finally able to enforce federal law and ensure that those seeking admission to our country are able to support themselves financially and not abuse taxpayer funded programs
 they were killing our country killing our country
 washington democrats have never been more extreme than they are right now
 frankly they're crazy
 these people are crazy
 they're taking their cues from socialists like bernie
 left-wing lawmakers are pushing a government takeover of health care that would strip 180 million americans of their private health care plans which many people like
 the plans of every democrat running for president would demolish the economy of new jersey where half a million new new jersey workers are employed at some of the best and most innovative health care employment companies
 we have them working at the companies and we have people getting great health care
 it's been so long
 it's finally working and they want to destroy it
 the republican party will never let it happen
 we are saving your health care while the democrats are trying to take away your health care take away your doctors take away all of the good care that we fought and we fought hard and we're doing well and now we're doing better
 by the way some time prior to the end of the year we're putting in for a new middle income tax cut a very big one
 but we're making health care better and much much cheaper
 we've done a great job in running it and we've given you a lot of alternatives
 we are protecting people with pre-existing conditions and we always will the republican party pre-existing conditions we saved it
 we are stopping surprise medical billing and making everything transparent
 that's a big deal and that will take effect starting in about two months from now
 everything's transparent
 you'll be able to see pricing
 you'll be able to go and price other hospitals other doctors
 it's going to be an incredible thing
 nobody believes i was able to do it but we did it
 we are defending your right to keep the doctor and the plan of your choice
 we are lowering drug prices
 the democrats are increasing drug prices
 we are fighting the lobbyists and special interests
 we are serving you and how are we doing
 we're doing good right
 but because of price transparency we are getting it done
 we're approving more generic drugs than ever before in the history of our country
 that means they come in frankly they're just as good as the big names but they sell for 80 less in some cases
 we are unleashing innovation to cure diseases of all kinds
 we are cutting out the rich middlemen and delivering prescription drugs directly to the consumers
 these are all things that we had to fight like hell to get
 we're making less paperwork for your doctors and giving you easy control of your medical records which is a big deal for a lot of people
 we are prohibiting hospitals from hiding their prices and charging hidden costs
 you go home you say oh i'm feeling better
 the doctor was fantastic and then they send you a bill for 25000
 that's the end of that
 all of a sudden the doctor wasn't so good right
 we are making companies compete for your business
 we are repealing burdensome taxes
 we have accomplished more than any president in the first three years of their term by far not even close
 we have provided health insurance options 60 cheaper than obamacare and we have historic investments in treating kidney disease hiv pediatric cancer and alzheimer's disease
 we're making so much progress
 we have just passed a thing that i think is great
 i never understood
 for 45 years they've been trying to get it passed
 we've just passed a thing called right to try
 you know what that is
 so we have the greatest doctors the greatest technicians the greatest labs in the world and we'll have a drug that's looking good but it's going to take five more years and by the way we've brought the timing way down from 12 years to half of that but it takes years to get it approved
 you have people that are terminally ill
 if they have money they go to asia they go to europe they go all over the world looking for help
 if they don't have money they go home and they die
 what we did is a thing called right to try
 people sign something and they don't hold the country responsible
 they don't hold the drug company responsible
 it's called right to try and they get the newest and the best and the latest medicine where it's looking good but you're not going to have it for five more years and you know why they didn't do it
 because they didn't want to hurt anybody except the problem is the people were going to die soon
 i said they're terminally ill
 let them have it
 we sat down with a great group of leaders republican leaders and honestly we had some bipartisan support and we got it done
 they've been tried to do it for 45 or so years
 we got it done
 you have to see the results and i've seen some of the results
 some of the results are incredible
 we've transformed veteran's health care including through va choice right
 va choice
 for 48 years they've been trying to get veterans choice
 i thought i had the greatest secret
 you know i haven't been doing this that long so four years ago i'm campaigning for president
 everyone said no he's only having fun
 yeah it's some fun
 this is a lot of fun
 right
 but for 45 years- but for 45 years they've been trying to get it veteran's choice
 so i come back one day i say to my people i have the greatest idea
 i am so smart
 i am like the smart- i have an idea because the veterans are waiting online
 they're waiting online for two weeks three weeks four weeks ten weeks
 some are okay and they end up being terminally ill by the time they see the doctors too long
 and i said folks i have the greatest idea
 all of my people i say i have the greatest idea
 i'm so smart
 here's what we're going to do
 we're going to send all those people that can't see a doctor we just can't get them to see a doctor
 we're going to send them down the road to private doctors and we're going to pay the bill and they're going to get fixed up
 right
 so smart
 but you see i said i was smart and they looked back at me and they said sir we've known about that concept for 45 years
 we just can't get it approved
 but i got it approved
 and i got it approved about 11 months ago
 and the va is doing fantastically well
 our veterans are doing great
 that was a big thing
 that was a big thing
 we also got accountability
 where people could mistreat our veterans do whatever they want they could be sadistic
 they could be so many other things
 they could steal they could rob
 you couldn't do anything you'd keep them
 you couldn't do a thing
 we got accountability
 now you look at him you say get the hell out of here
 you're fired you're fired
 now you can fire
 they've let go of more than 8000 bad people
 we have reduced opioid deaths for the first time and very substantially in 30 years
 and we are modernizing critical vaccines
 we're doing a great job with vaccines
 we are creating a pathway to buy drugs from canada that are much much cheaper in florida
 governor ron desantis came to me
 he said sir this system is so bad
 and you can't fix it unless you have democrat votes that's why you got to vote the house
 you got to get us back the house
 they say sir we can buy the drugs in canada for 50 less
 the same drug made in the same factory made by the same company
 50 and we can give the benefit for the people that live in florida or colorado or new jersey or wherever you are
 this has been going on for a long time
 no president has wanted to do it
 you know how long it took me to make that decision
 i said if you can say 50 or 25 or 15 buy it
 do it
 go
 and i gave him authorization do it
 we are protecting medicare for our nation's seniors
 democrats want and you know this democrats want to raid medicare to fund benefits for illegal immigrants
 and you know we all have a heart
 we all have a heart but when you tell people to come into our country like this clown governor of california come into our country
 they're all going to come
 if they think they're going to get free education free healthcare they're all going to come
 if you don't say it they're not going to come
 because who would even think this
 virtually every top democrat also now supports late term abortion
 ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up until the moment of birth
 and that is why i've asked congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from god
 democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion socialism and blatant corruption
 look at what's happening to their cities
 los angeles it's so sad
 what you see is so sad with the homeless and the way they don't take care of the homeless
 san francisco starting in new york
 you could take a look at what's happening to our cities run by democrats
 it's a disaster
 they don't know what the hell they're doing
 the republican party is the party of the american worker the american family and the american dream
 republicans are fighting for citizens from every background and from every race religion color and creed
 we are asking all americans to join our incredible movement
 that's what it is
 it's one of the greatest moments
 it's probably the greatest movement in history
 the 2016 election was probably i mean you could say the greatest election in the history of our country
 and now we have to do it again to keep it going
 it's like a giant tree you plant it but it takes time to grab on
 we need this next election so badly
 the good news is it's much easier because here i've done it all
 i've achieved more than i promised
 i never told you about space force
 we got space force
 i never told you about all of these things that we got
 we are a big tent party in the true idea
 it's big ideas and we have a big future together
 this country has tremendous potential if we don't blow it
 to give former prisoners a second chance at life we pass bi-partisan criminal justice reform
 they came to me they couldn't get it done including many conservatives
 and these people that i fight every day they came to me help help help
 criminal justice reform
 i got it done
 as soon as i got it done they don't even want to mention my name
 i got it done
 i got people to vote for it that they could have never gotten
 president obama tried he couldn't get it done
 president bush couldn't get it
 they couldn't get it done
 that's okay
 they couldn't get it done
 i got it done
 i got it done
 and after i got it done and i mean solely got it done and after i got it done they had news conferences
 they're thanking people that i never even heard of
 the only one they didn't think was president trump
 and i got it done but that's the way it is
 that's why i always say you have to thank yourself because nobody else is going to do it
 we're fighting to give school choice to every child in america who needs it
 during national school choice week we reaffirmed that no parent should be forced to send their child to a failing government school
 school choice very important
 democrats don't want that
 to uphold the rule of law we have confirmed 191 brand new beautiful federal judges who will interpret the constitution as written
 and two great supreme court justices two great ones
 as we rebuild our military we have authorized over 160 million to support our warriors at a place called huh mcguire air force base and fort dix
 have you ever heard of those places
 have you ever heard of those places new jersey
  160 million two great places
 i recognized israel's true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem
 and we recognize israeli sovereignty over the golan heights
 nobody else was going to do it
 they've been trying to do that one for 52 years
 for years you watched as your politicians apologized for america
 now you have a president who is standing up for america and we are standing up for the people of new jersey
 my friends
 at stake in our present battle is the survival of our nation
 i really mean that it's the survival of our nation
 and if you would have had the other party winning this last election instead of your market being up 72
 instead of your 401ks being up numbers that you can't even believe where your wife or your husband says darling you're the most brilliant person in history
 for years you've been losing your ass with 401ks
 now you're making a fortune
 right
 right
 now you're making a fortune
 i have people coming up to me all the time
 i had one gentlemen come up sir
 thank you sir
 you've made me look so smart
 my wife never respected me for anything not anything
 but now she thinks i'm a great investor
 thank you
 401k
 if you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of americans have fought and died for it to secure then we must devote everything that we have toward victory in 2020
 we have to
 and by the way when we talk about inheriting victory in 2020 in our nation just so you understand under a big tax cut biggest tax cut plan in history guess what you have
 you have a business you have a farm you have a small business no more inheritance tax no more what we call death tax
