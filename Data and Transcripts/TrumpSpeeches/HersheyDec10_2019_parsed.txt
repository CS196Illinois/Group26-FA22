 well thank you to vice president pence
 thank you mike
 and hello pennsylvania
 hello
 it's great to be back in this state that gave us the liberty bell pennsylvania steel hershey chocolate
 i like hershey chocolate
 the nittany lions
 the nittany lions they're doing pretty well too and the incredible american patriots just like you you are patriots
 thank you very much
 thank you
 under republican leadership america is stronger than ever before and we are respected again
 last month you saw it we smashed expectations with another 266000 jobs and unemployment is now more than a 50-year low
 we have never seen what's going on with different groups
 unemployment is at a position we've never had anything like this
 you are so lucky i became your president
 i'm only kidding
 i have to say i'm kidding because the fake news back there will take that
 they'll take that statement and they'll blow it up and they'll say he said they were lucky to have him as president
 what a horrible thing to say
 because they're fake
 anyway here in pennsylvania you had the single best year that you've ever had in the history of our country not bad
 the pennsylvania unemployment rate has reached an all time record low
 and i hate to tell you this when i was campaigning three and a half years ago i'd come here you weren't doing so well folks
 you weren't doing so well
 wages were way down unemployment was way up
 it wasn't a pretty picture
 just a few months ago i visited the new shell petrochemical plant in beaver county at 6 billion with a b 6 billion
 it is the largest investment in pennsylvania history
 we're ending decades of failed trade policies that devastated communities all across the state
 for generations american manufacturing was the bedrock of your economy the bedrock
 remember the last administration  you need a magic wand
 it'll never come back
 we found the magic wand didn't we
 then came nafta the nafta disaster i call it one of the worst trade deals in the history of any country and the loss of one in three pennsylvania manufacturing jobs
 your politicians always pledged to fix it
 they'd talk about it for years and years and decades but they never were able to do it
 they came and they went to washington and they did nothing
 but unlike those politicians i keep my promises
 and i love pennsylvania
 i went to school in pennsylvania you know that right
 i know it well
 and i'm thrilled to report that we are on the verge of ending the nafta catastrophe once and for all
 congress will soon vote on my new trade deal the us-mexico-canada agreement or usmca
 after years of waiting many many years many many decades they've been looking for this and then we got it done and we've been waiting for a long time for nancy pelosi to announce usmca and she did it on the same day that they announced that they are going to impeach the 45th president of the united states and your favorite president i think
 and the reason they announced it on the same day one hour later they announce impeachment a few guys standing behind her
 they announced the impeachment and then an hour later she announced that she's going to usmca
 you know why
 it's a huge deal and it plays down the impeachment because they are embarrassed by the impeachment and our poll numbers have gone through the roof because of her stupid impeachment
 and think of it this way also the silver lining of impeachment and this witch hunt that's the reason they approved usmca
 so that's okay with me because they approved it and they're very happy to have it
 but honestly it's an incredible deal for our country
 took too long it waited in congress for too long a time
 incredible deal and replacing the worst nafta
 we've also just reached a deal with congress to invest a record 738 billion more into our great military
 when i took over i will tell you i became president… think of it almost three years ago
 by the way was that the most exciting night ever
 i'm just watching these people that was one of the greatest evenings in the history of television from a rating standpoint from an excitement standpoint what the hell would they do without me and you
 they'd be gone
 about a month before i ran i picked up a new york times it was like a leaflet that you had out at a grocery store and now it's thick
 they've got all their reporters covering trump trump trump
 i can't imagine they won't endorse because without me winning you know what happens
 they all go down the tombs they got all of them washington post new york times those very dishonest networks
 they are very dishonest very very dishones
 no they're very dishonest people
 and i have to say this look and i always have to say this you have some really great journalists and you have some honest publications but not too many of them i have to be honest with you
 well you know that
 does anybody think the media is honest
 does anybody think they're totally corrupted and dishonest
 all right
 the legislation will also officially establish something that's so important to me because it's where it's at
 and a lot of people used to smile and now outside of the wall which we're building… the wall is going on
 it gets one of the biggest applause of anything it's the sixth branch of the united states armed forces the space force
 we're opening up the space force because you know what that's where it's at
 and everything's built right here in the united states
 that's simple
 and by the way we build the greatest weapons the greatest planes the greatest ships we build it in the united states there's nobody that comes close
 we have the greatest military equipment anywhere in the world rockets and missiles no place builds it like us
 we have the best in the world and we sell it to allies and they all want to buy from the united states
 we've never had a thing like this
 we are so hot
 we are so hot
 and just a few weeks ago the united states special forces brought the world's number one terrorist to justice
 thanks to the strength and courage of our warriors and they're great warriors the bloodthirsty savage known as al baghdadi is now dead
 and he was quickly replaced by his second-in-command and his second-in-command is now dead
 and we've got our eye on and our sights on third also we know exactly where and when but it's becoming a very unpopular job not a lot of takers and that's what we want
 go back to living a good normal life because america is winning again
 america is winning again like never before
 and as i always say and i've already said it twice tonight this country is so respected and we were not respected four years ago we were laughed at
 but while we're delivering historic victories for the american people the radical left democrats and the failed washington establishment are trying to erase your votes nullify the election and overthrow our democracy
 not going to happen don't worry about it
 i wouldn't lose too much sleep over it
 and i have to say this about the republicans the republicans… and you have a lot of great ones here tonight your congressman
 you have a lot of great ones these congressmen are great
 the republicans have never been so united as they are right now ever
 the house the senate we've never been this united because it's all a hoax and they understand it
 they also understand poll numbers but i'm sure that had nothing to do with it
 but the impeachment hoax is about overturning your great 2016 vote or in the alternative trying to win the 2020 election
 that's not going to happen
 yesterday the justice department's inspector general released a report detailing the outrageous scandalous and unprecedented abuses of power
 get them out
 get her out
 get her out
 get her out
 see these guys want to be so politically correct you get her out
 you see that
 i'll tell you law enforcement is so great
 that particular guy wanted to be so politically correct
 we don't want to be politically correct
 i don't know who he was he didn't do the greatest job so they tried to frame innocent people in the ludicrous… it all started with the russia witch hunt
 then the inspector general shocking report proved that the obama fbi obtained secret warrants to spy on my campaign based on a phony foreign dossier of debunk smears paid for by crooked hillary clinton and the dnc
 the fbi failed to disclose the nature of the political hit job to the pfizer court
 they hid it they deceived it and they lied
 the dossier was written by a discredited foreign agent who quote desperate that donald trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being the united states president
 what's this
 folks they spied on our campaign they spied
 never happened before in the history of our country and we're really wise to it
 we're wise to it
 the inspector general found that the fbi spying application contained 17 errors and omissions commonly known as lies and deceit
 when the fbi… and you have great people in the fbi but not in leadership
 you have not good people in leadership you haven't had
 when the fbi uncovered evidence showing that we did absolutely nothing wrong which was right at the beginning they hid that exonerating you know that
 they hid it
 they hid it so nobody could see it so they could keep this hoax going on for two years
 they knew right at the beginning that it was all a frame up a set up but they hid it so that nobody could see it so they could keep it going on thinking they were going to hurt us politically
 but now we're stronger politically than we were ever before
 and the fbi also sent multiple undercover human spies to surveil and record people associated with our campaign
 look how they've hurt people
 they've destroyed the lives of people that were great people that are still great people
 their lives have been destroyed by scum by scum
 an fbi lawyer forged took an email… forged forged an email used as evidence an act which is now the subject of a criminal referral
 what they did is so unbelievable
 oh i look forward… i don't know
 i don't know keep away
 i look forward to bull durham's report that's the one i look forward to
 and this report was great by the ig especially since he was appointed by president barack hussein obama
 considering that fact it was great because we learned a lot of things that nobody would have found out variously although i suspect we would have
 we also know from a previous inspector general investigation that many of these same high ranking officials were consumed with anti- trump and anti-trump people hatred and bias texting about an insurance policy let's have an insurance… remember
 remember
 peter strzok and his lover lisa page
 remember
 lisa i love you so much
 lisa please lisa please
 lisa i've never loved anyone like you
 we won't allow this to happen to our country
 lisa please tell me you love me
 lisa i love you
 peter i love you
 i love you like i've never loved anyone
 and if for any reason she loses even though she's a stone called corrupt person if for any reason she loses peter we've got to have an insurance policy we have to do it because we're going to go…  and that's what's been happening for the last two and a half years
 it was their phony insurance policy
 so fbi lawyer lisa page so in love that she didn't know what the hell was happening texted the head of counter intelligence peter strzok likewise so in love he couldn't see straight
 this poor guy did i hear he needed a restraining order after this whole thing to keep him away from lisa
 that's what i heard
 i don't know if it's true
 the fake news will never report it but it could be true
 no that's what i heard
 i don't know
 i mean who could believe a thing like that
 no i heard that peter strzok needed a restraining order to keep him away from his once lover
 ah lisa i hope you're miss him
 lisa he'll never be the same
 but he said he's not ever going to become president and strzok look back no no he won't
 we'll stop it
 we'll stop it
 can you believe we found these texts
 this is fbi agents at a high level
 no no
 we'll stop it
 they're going to stop us from winning an election and then we have to listen there was no bias
 oh there was no bias
 think of these people they write here was no bias
 and yet he saying no no darling we'll stop it
 and then they announce there was no bias
 now you know what we're doing and it's not easy and somebody said a regular president… i don't want to use the word normal because that's not a nice normal refer… a regular president would have been under a table thumb in the mouth saying take me home mommy this is too tough for me
 it's true
 true they know
 and while it was tough on my family i have to say very unfair to my family very tough on my family
 i have a great family tough… for me it's my life
 i do it i do it
 it's one thing but very tough on a family thing a thing like this happens it's a disgrace
 but day after day we're exposing something called that filthy disgusting horrible swamp and we're cleaning it up
 and now after and a half years now that the russia witch hunt is dead a big fat disgusting fraud the congressional democrats are pushing the impeachment witch hunt having to do with ukraine but that's already failing
 you saw their so-called articles of impeachment today people are saying they're not even a crime
 what happened
 all of these horrible things remember
 bribery and this and that
 where are they
 they send these two things and not even a crime
 this is the lightest weakest impeachment…
 our country has had actually many impeachments you recall judges and lots of… many impeachments but it was on today everybody said this is impeachment light
 this is the lightest impeachment in the history of our country by far
 it's not even like an impeachment
 these people are stone cold crooked
 when a guy like shifty schiff he's a corrupt politician he made up my statement because… see i did one thing very good as soon as i heard about this deal i released my statement immediately but he had already made horrible statements
 and by the way the whistleblower the whistleblower defrauded our country because the whistleblower wrote something that was totally untrue and we broke up the game
 remember the second whistleblower was coming right
 and then the informer who is the informer
 i know who the informer is
 so the informer obviously gave him a false information because they wrote in the whistleblower report they wrote something totally different from what i said what i said was perfect
 but it screwed up the whole works because most guys would never do that
 they didn't even know probably that we had it transcribed professionally transcribed word for word transcribed so beautiful
 am i lucky i had it transcribed
 think of that
 think of that
 so when i said release it… and i don't like doing that because you're releasing it it's a conversation with a foreign leader in this case a very fine gentlemen president of ukraine the new president of ukraine
 and we call them up and we said would it be okay
 our secretary of state made the call would it be okay
 and they didn't know what we were talking about but they said yeah it's okay
 and by the way he his foreign minister everybody did you know they said there was no pressure
 he didn't do anything wrong
 there was no pressure put on us
 that didn't stop anybody but we released the conversation and that gummed it up
 now all of a sudden we never heard from the second whistleblower
 we never heard about who the informer was
 the whistleblower who's going to come out strong he's disappeared
 where's the whistleblower
 he's disappeared
 he's gone
 maybe our great congressman can find him
 he's gone
 maybe our great congressmen can find him
 okay
 but the whistleblower is gone
 he flew the coop because he reported incorrectly and the ig who didn't want to look at the conversation he was so anxious to turn the whistleblower report over to congress so that congress could have fun with it ought to be ashamed of himself
 but today the house democrats announced these two flimsy pathetic ridiculous articles of impeachment
 the house democrats are walking back from everything they claimed
 with today's announcement they're now admitting there was no collusion there was no obstruction of justice and there were no crimes whatsoever
 there are no crimes
 it says that there are no crimes
 they're impeaching me and there are no crimes
 this has to be a first in history
 they're impeaching me
 you know why
 because they want to win an election
 and that's the only way they can do it
 so the democrats have nothing and they've turned the somber process of impeachment
 and it was you know to me impeachment is a very ugly word
 it's a word i associate with some very bad times in our country
 the good news is we're having the best times in history in our country
 okay
 but the word impeachment to me is a very very ugly word
 it's a dark ugly word
 but but i have to tell you as bad as it is it meant something
 when you had serious high crimes and misdemeanors when you had serious go ahead it's impeachment
 that would happen every 50 years every 40 years every 100 years
 this was a big deal
 they're making it so like let's do it every six months
 they've cheapened a process
 they've cheapened a process
 these people are so bad the radical left democrats and i actually think that pelosi who by the way by the way by the way she has totally lost control
 she has totally … it's being run now by this crazy aoc plus three
 aoc plus three
 now it's being run by other people
 the far left has just grabbed that party
 it is so sad to see
 and she knew what would happen
 i didn't because i didn't figure the polls would go through the roof
 they went out today
 in michigan in wisconsin in a place called pennsylvania
 no no
 the polls are through the roof
 they're called swing states very important states
 we won pennsylvania the last time and we're going to win it again but even bigger
 our polls have gone over the last month they've gone through the roof
 you look at it take a look at it it came out today
 the firehouse poll it's an important poll
 it was always good
 i never looked at it
 today i like it a lot
 we're up through … nobody can even believe it
 so what pelosi did and as i said they do the impeachment then right away let's do usmca right on top of it
 you'd think she'd wait like a day
 she wanted to smother the impeachment crap and that's probably what she did at least to an extent
 but any democrat that votes for this sham will be voting to sacrifice their house majority their dignity and their career
 okay
 and some of these partisan lunatics have already said that if they fail this time think of this
 how about low iq maxine waters
 how about green
 how about green
 we've green
 how about green where he said we have to impeach him because if we don't impeach him we're not going to win the election
 this is what we're dealing with
 you know we're dealing with some very bad people
 we're dealing with people that don't respect you
 and by the way you know they talk about the elite
 you're the elite
 they're not the elite
 you're the elite
 you're the elite
 you got better education
 you got better everything
 you're the elite
 it always bothers me they said the elite
 this is the elite
 look at these people
 how beautiful
 this is the elite
 you know who are the elite
 you look at those jobs reports
 we're the best in history unemployment for african americans best in history unemployment hispanic americans best in history unemployment asian americans
 you're the elite
 you're the elite
 but they said they'll do it again because this has been a total bust
 they'll do it again
 and by the way the senate's been so professional so good so strong so solid
 just like these gentlemen in the house
 so solid
 so we have to vote these crazy people the hell out of office
 and in 2020 i'm going to work like hell that we take over the house
 we have to take over the house
 we have to
 right
 got to take over the house mike
 so here are the facts that shifty schiff … is that guy the worst
 he comes up to a microphone now he comes up to a microphone like two and a half years ago i have absolute proof that the president of the united states conspired with russia
 russia
 what the hell do i have to do with russia
 by the way russia wishes that hillary clinton won
 they wish
 we are now number one in the world in energy
 russia is number three
 we're beating out russia and saudi arabia
 you'd have windmills all over the place if you had crooked hillary
 they'd be knocking out those birds left and right
 those windmills
 wah wah wah
 darling i want to watch television tonight and there's no damn wind
 what do i do
 i want to watch the election results
 darling there's no wind
 the damn wind just isn't blowing like it used to because of global warming i think
 i think it's global warming
 global warming
 no more wind no more life
 the ocean is going to rise 18 of an inch within the next 250 years
 we're going to be wiped out
 look i want clean air
 i want clean water crystal clean i want and that's what we have at a record level
 our air and our water are cleaner now than it's ever been with all that we're doing and we haven't closed up all of our industry and we haven't closed up our businesses and lost all those jobs
 and right now we're by far the largest economy in the world
 if you remember you could look if you go back five six seven years in 2019 they say china was going to catch us as the world's largest economy
 guess what
 they're way behind
 they're way behind
 because over the last three years you see the stock market set 131 records from the day
 think of that
 and that means jobs that means 401ks
 i have so many people that come up to me thank you sir
 my wife is so in love with me because i went up 79 in the 401k
 she thinks i'm a genius
 she always thought i was a total stiff a dumb stupid dope
 now she thinks i'm a financial genius sir
 and all i did was buy some stock
 i have stock in a 401k and you made me into a genius sir
 she loves me so much more than she ever did
 shows you the power of money right
 isn't that terrible
 but i have so many people 401ks are through the roof your jobs are through the roof we have the lowest unemployment rate
 and now more importantly than anything wages are up for the first time in many many years decades decades
 you remember four years ago i was here and i told people i said you know 20 years ago people made more money than they made four years ago
 not now
 not anymore
 because people now can not only make a lot more money if they don't like their job they go out and they get a different job and they get more money and ultimately they find one that they love
 you have so many opportunities right now
 wages are up jobs are up
 and today we set a new record almost 160 million people are working
 we've never come close to that number
 that's a hell of a number
 but just quickly here are the facts on shifty schiff
 dishonest guy makes up my statements
 he said the president of ukraine repeatedly declared that there was no pressure but he didn't want to say that
 we said say it
 say it you crooked bastard say it
 but he doesn't want to say it
 we said sat it
 i'd like to force him to say it
 he'll walk up to the mic ladies and gentlemen guy's a total corrupt guy
 listen just to finish off a man who i really i don't know him but i respect him because the ukrainian foreign minister and he said it so strongly i have never seen a direct link between investigations and security assistance
 he just said that the democrats who are corrupt refuse to say that and that's ultimately the only one that matters the leaders of ukraine because they're the ones that know of this pressure not some crooked ambassador that's a deep stater or that's a bushy or that's a clintonite or that's a barack obama ambassador
 okay
 the ones that matter are the leadership of the country that we're talking about
 they refuse to say it because they're dishonest people
 there's only one way to stop the rabid partisan democrats pennsylvania voters must show up in 2020 so we can take back the house hold the senate and keep the white house
 it's the only way
 only way
 okay so i'm going to ask these people to come up on this stage because we have warriors with us tonight
 we love warriors like the guys that killed al-baghdadi
 you know how much press i got
 i don't care about press
 but conan the dog got more than i did and that's okay
 conan was almost electrocuted he deserves it
 they gave me about a day and that's okay because the people understand we made a great decision
 and remember this al-baghdadi was the founder of isis al-baghdadi was a vicious ruthless person al-baghdadi created a caliphate bigger than the state of ohio
 think of that that's a big caliphate
 and we now have taken 100 of the caliphate and we have thousands and thousands of isis prisoners
 with obama you did nothing
 you did nothing but get your ass kicked
 true
 true
 all right we're joined tonight by many of the terrific warriors that have helped me so much in so many ways
 they fight for us
 they really are incredible
 and they come right from the state of pennsylvania
 hey do you ever notice where biden keeps saying he's in the wrong state
 like if he's in ohio it's great to be an iowa tonight
 if he's in pennsylvania it's wonderful to be in the state of delaware
 what is wrong with this guy
 what's wrong with him
 there's something wrong
 okay
 there's something wrong
 no he keeps … how many times can you do that
 so far it could happen because you know i was doing six and seven a day that last month that last beautiful month that i loved i was doing six
 i left these guys alone
 i didn't want to do interviews they were a waste of time
 we just did these big beautiful rallies
 and you know if you start getting a little … you know i went to michigan then i went to wisconsin then i went … i'm sitting here saying what the hell is going on
 these crowds are incredible
 and we had the biggest crowds
 by the way to this day there has never been and they'll always correct me in the history of politics in the history of our country there has never been anybody that drew crowds like we draw and i don't have a guitar
 i have no guitar
 but this has never happened
 i mean if you took ronald reagan and we all like ronald reagan i liked him i thought he was a great guy but if he came to pennsylvania for a rally if he had 1000 people in a ballroom or something you know
 i mean we're getting crowds 25-30000 people and then there'll be 20000 people outside
 we set up screens outside and if anybody would like to stand in the rain watching
 and do you people out there i'm sorry it's pretty rough
 but no there's never been anything like it
 one instruction get me the biggest arena you can get
 we don't have empty seats
 i mean look at this
 how many seats is this
 11000
 how much
 10500 it's packed
 it's beyond that
 and don't forget look at the floor and then you go out
 no and then you go out and you look outside and you have thousands and thousands because there's a spirit for what we're doing
 we're fixing our country we're healing our country
 we're making america great again
 so i want to ask a couple of our great warriors to come forward
 representative glenn thompson come up here glenn

 so i just want to thank this is an amazing group of people and with their help and the help of everyone here we are going to set records like we've never set before
 you know i used to say and i sort of still have to say 2016 i don't know if anything like that can ever happen but i think we're much better
 all of the things i said we're going to cut taxes
 we're going to cut regulations
 we're going to take care of our vets look what we did for our vets with choice right
 look what we did
 look what we did
 we now have the ability to fire all of the bad people that are in the va
 right
 fired over 8000 people that were disrespecting our vets
 they wouldn't have done it in primetime i can tell you that
 but what we've done for our vets what we've done in rebuilding our military what we've done in so many ways and we unlike the democrats will protect your second amendment
 okay
 so we've done a job and we're proud of it and we have tremendous people
 let's give them a hand and thank you very much
 thank you
 thank you everybody
 thank you
 thank you folks
 vote for these people
 even if you don't like them vote for them
 oh that's a beautiful new hat
 look at the hat that guy's got on
 how's that hat working out
 is that good
 i love that hat
 look at this guy that says keep america great
 should we do the poll
 should we do a poll
 okay ready
 so we have the greatest phrase in the history of politics make america great again
 wait
 and we have our new phrase because we've made america great
 i've told you stock market we've rebuilt our military we've cut your taxes at a level that nobody could even think possible
 take a look at your median income take a look at what's happened
 the numbers median household income take a look at your numbers
 with president bush it went up 400 in eight years
 with president obama it went up 975 in eight years
 with president trump it went up 5000 but whoa whoa whoa in less than three years
 that's a big thing
 wait
 and then when you add energy savings and you add tax savings you have almost a 10000 gain in three years
 that's a big difference
 and that's one of the very big reasons why our i think that and regulations but that's one of the very big reasons why our economy is doing so well because they talk about our consumer is loaded with money
 thank you very much mr
 president i appreciate it
 but with the help of everyone here we have now the hottest economy
 you know when i meet dictators and presidents and kings and queens and prime ministers they all come into that beautiful oval office
 so beautiful right
 so respected
 and the first thing they almost always say sir congratulations on your economy
 we're trying to do the same thing
 i said you won't be able to do it
 you won't
 they won't be able to
 let them give it a shot
 but they all say congratulations on the great job you've done with economy
 but we've all done the great job
 not me
 we've all done it
 i've been your spokesman and i've done a good job as spokesman
 but they all say that
 but we've done a good job in many ways
 you know all of the promises that i made i'm the only politician in history that i've actually kept more promises than i made
 think of that
 in other words i made here like a thing like right to try nobody talked about right to try
 we got right to try
 that's somebody terminally ill we have the greatest medicines in the world the greatest doctors the greatest labs in the world nobody close but it takes years to get it approved
 and i got it approved so you can sign a document get it
 if you want to see the lives that we're saving it's a beautiful thing
 a beautiful thing is happening right to try
 right to try
 but we've also created 7 million new jobs since the election
 if i would have said that the fake news would have gone crazy they would have said that's impossible
 these people would have gone crazy
 they go crazy anyway and i don't even say it
 and right here in pennsylvania we've created 160 000 brand new beautiful jobs and you have companies moving in and moving back
 and as i said african american hispanic american asian american unemployment the lowest ever in the history of our country the lowest unemployment rates
 wages for low income workers have gone up more than 10
 nobody thought that was possible
 they're one of the biggest in terms of a group one of the biggest beneficiaries
 this year 40 million american families will benefit from the republican child tax credit each receiving an average of 2200
 we ended the last administration's war on american energy the united states is now and i said it and i'll say it all night long number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world and there's nobody even close
 in the state of pennsylvania natural gas production is up 34 since our election 34
 virtually every leading democrat has pledged to entirely eliminate american production of oil clean coal natural gas
 i don't think somebody coming into pennsylvania you know those new petrochemical plants they don't like them at all
 thousands and thousands of jobs
 incredible
 millions of dollars in taxes
 how about going to the state of texas
 we had one candidate who turned out not to be too good a candidate right
 beto beto
 remember
 so he wanted to get rid of religion the bible he wanted to get rid of guns and he wanted to get rid of oil
 how about going to texas and say no bible no oil think of this one no bible no oil no guns
 i think you could be abraham lincoln and not win that particular race
 and it wouldn't be much different in the state of pennsylvania that i can tell you
 but you know somebody that believes in that is sleepy joe biden
 he was caught telling a far left radical activist that he would shut down fossil fuel production in pennsylvania
 you saw that
 but the voters of this commonwealth will never ever let that happen
 can you imagine a guy coming in whether it's him or anybody else
 they all want to do it
 he just raises his hand he has no clue what he's doing
 they raise their hand
 remember he looked
 do you want to give illegal aliens healthcare even though we're taking it away from our own soldiers that are up … and he looks and they're all raising their hand
 did you see that
 well he oh oh oh okay i'll do it too
 in addition to replacing nafta i've taken the toughest ever action against china's trade abuses
 they want to make a deal so badly
 and we're doing well with the deal but they want to make a deal
 please make a deal
 we don't want to pay tariffs anymore
 please please
 thanks to our steel tariffs steel mills in pennsylvania are roaring back to life
 and u
s
 steel has just announced 1 billion investment in mon valley works in pittsburgh
 you know that right
 1 billion
 they weren't investing they were divesting
 the steel companies it's an amazing achievement
 we tax all of the dumped steel comes in from china and other places 25
 … the dump steel comes in from china and other places
 25
 all of it
 all of a sudden our steel mills are doing again
 we need steel
 it's not like you could say gee we'll get it from another country
 we need that for defense
 we need it for our ships we need it for our planes
 we need it
 we can't play games with steel
 after years of rebuilding other nations we are finally rebuilding our nation
 very importantly in everything we do we are putting america first
 sorry
 we gave up on the globalist folks
 let's build the world
 let's forget about our country
 let's just rebuild the world
 or no issue have the democrat politicians more thoroughly betrayed the american people than on the issue of immigration
 far left politician… i mean they're fighting me on the wall you have no idea
 but we're building it and it's fine and we have the money coming in from the military
 i've got it from here from there from there
 believe me if i weren't a good developer you could forget about that wall
 i've got here there there
 these people fought me and we've started winning in court
 you know what
 speaking of court we will soon have 182 federal judges including court of appeals
 nobody can believe it
 all because barack obama gave us 142 empty seats
 when you're a president they always say i disagree
 i think the most important thing we can do is defense right
 but beyond defense they always say the most important thing you can do is judges and justices of the supreme court
 we have two great ones
 great ones
 but they always say judges and supreme court justices
 when you leave office i hope in 5 years 9 years 13 years 17 years 21 years 25 years 29 years
 when i leave office… now i'm only doing that to drive them totally crazy
 that drives them crazy
 even joking about it
 we have this idiot comedian who stands up he's talking to a guest right
 he said you know he's going to win don't you
 you know it
 the guy goes no no
 we're going to fight
 we're going to fight
 and they will
 no no no
 you know he's going to win
 then he goes you know he's going to win
 and you know he's never leaving don't you
 he's never leaving
 at first i thought he was kidding
 he's a whack job
 he is totally serious
 he honestly believes that
 i don't know should we give it a shot
 maybe we'll give it a shot
 i'm only kidding
 i'm only kidding
 media i'm only kidding
 they won't write that but that's okay
 they won't write the i'm only kidding part
 but far left politicians support deadly sanctuary cities demonstrating their sneering contempt scorned and disdained for everyday americans
 these jurisdictions deliberately release dangerous violent criminal aliens out of their jails and directly onto your streets where they are free to offend where they are free to kill where they are free to rape where they are free to beat up people except for ice because ice is much tougher than them
 they don't beat up ice
 they don't beat up ice
 you're lucky we have ice
 they want to put ice out of business
 that's not happening
 ice is… they're incredible people
 they're great patriots and they're tough
 thanks to democrat immigration policies innocent americans in all 50 states are being brutalized and murdered by illegal alien criminals
 last summer at least 19 illegal aliens were charged in connection with grizzly homicides including hacking victims to death and ripping out in two cases their hearts
 weeks ago two illegal aliens and members of the savage gang ms-13 who we are removing from our country by the thousands were charged with relentlessly beating a wonderful beautiful high school teenager to death with a baseball bat and chopping the body apart with a machete
 one of the animals accused was previously released by local authorities in defiance of an ice demand
 ice warned and said you can't let them go
 they wanted them
 they would do anything for them
 they wanted them to hand this animal over for deportation back to his country
 get them the hell out of our country right
 democrats' sanctuary cities also give safe haven to those who commit violent sex crimes
 since montgomery county maryland declared itself a sanctuary jurisdiction in july we have already identified nine illegal aliens who have been arrested for rape sexual assault including a 26-year-old man charged with raping and viciously strangling a young wonderful woman who was entering her apartment innocently entering her apartment
 she was raped and killed strangled to death
 sanctuary city
 maryland
 but these are only the cases we know about
 sanctuary cities and jails actively conceal illegal alien crime and criminals from federal government
 federal government wants to take them out or in some cases if it's real violence and we don't want to pay for the cost but we do put them into very strong jails
 the sanctuary city of philadelphia
 the sanctuary city in philadelphia is one of the very worst sanctuaries anywhere in america
 did you know that
 i mean i know philadelphia well
 going to school here we never heard about sanctuary cities did we
 weeks ago an illegal alien charged with rape sexual assault of a child and inflicting serious bodily injury was released by philadelphia to wander free in your communities
 by the way you may have the worst district attorney or whatever the hell you call it
 this guy i've been hearing about this guy he lets killers out almost immediately
 what the hell
 how did you let that happen
 instead of handing them over while still in jail they defied ice
 they fought with ice and set him loose upon an unsuspecting family
 thankfully at great time and effort our brave ice officers were eventually able to track him down arrest him detain him and do what has to be done
 how do you elect democrats when they create a sanctuary city of philadelphia
 i don't get it
 four ms-13 gang members were also arrested in pennsylvania in connection with the brutal and sadistic murders of a 21-year-old and a 15-year-old
 as we speak a criminal illegal alien with three prior deportations is roaming free in pennsylvania because he was released by the city of philadelphia the city of brotherly love
 you better get yourself a new prosecutor in this place i want to tell you
 that's a horrible thing
 no it's a national story how he wants everybody to not pay the price
 you're talking about not paying the price for rape for murder for other horrible crimes
 how stupid can you be
 the charges against this alien include rape aggravated indecent assault unlawful contact with a minor indecent exposure and terroristic threats
 other than that he was a very nice person
 philadelphia has defied ice and released illegals charged with everything from assault to kidnapping to drug crimes to sex crimes to homicide murder
 democrats stand for crime corruption and chaos
 republicans stand for law and order and we stand for justice
 we stand for justice
 we side with law enforcement and with law-abiding americans not ruthless gang members and not violent criminals aliens that come into our country illegally
 they take our payments
 payments
 some of these people with these crazy laws that you have
 look at what's going on in california
 they do better than our great veterans
 they do better than citizens of our country
 and they advertise we will take you
 we will take care of you
 we will pay for it
 and then you wonder why we have so many people trying to come through at the borders
 but we do a great job
 we're removing these criminal illegal aliens from our country by the thousands
 we're sending them home and we're not letting them come back in
 we're being very tough
 mexico is now giving us 27000 soldiers at our border
 and guatemala honduras and el salvador we signed a very important agreement with each
 when their people come into our country they weren't taking them back
 now they take them back and they say thank you very much
 they weren't taking them back
 if we had a murderer from honduras guatemala el salvador we want to bring them back under past administrations
 they bring them and they say we don't want them
 don't land
 you're playing with us
 they say thank you very much
 we will take them back
 because we've let them know the price is very bad if they don't do that
 thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border illegal crossings are down 75 since may and the wall is going up at a very rapid pace
 the radical democrats have gotten more and more extreme
 that's why they did this impeachment hoax because nancy pelosi had absolutely no control
 she knew what was going to happen
 she knew
 the radical left has taken over the democrat party
 democrats are pushing for a socialist takeover of healthcare that would strip you of the doctor and coverage of your choice
 we have 180 million people with private healthcare that love it
 they're going to take it away from you
 i don't think so
 crazy elizabeth warren or as i affectionately call her pocahontas her ridiculous plan would cost 52 trillion
 that's more money than we take in in one year two years three years four years five years six years about seven years
 that's for one year
 52 trillion
 and you don't have your doctor
 i mean the whole… well she's starting to crash again
 i thought i knocked her down
 i did that heavy heavy pocahontas deal
 i give her credit
 i thought she was left for… i mean there were just little embers and then she rose
 she rose then she became strong
 but then she opened that fresh mouth of hers and it stopped
 it stopped
 i don't see her as a threat
 i don't think she makes it
 i mean you don't know
 crazy things are happening in the democrat party
 it used to be a sane party
 now it's an insane party
 so you don't know
 but they're all looking at the same thing
 i mean you have alfred e
 neuman who's running who's this guy
 this guy buttigieg
 buttigieg
 can you believe he's doing well
 he's like the leading fundraiser
 i dream about him
 it's true
 no buttigieg
 but i'm not going too far with any of these people because i thought i was way too early with elizabeth warren
 we destroyed her too fast
 so she came back
 but she's going back down again
 did anybody see her beer deal where she said darling
 did you ever see that deal
 darling
 it's about her husband
 darling it's great to see you
 what are you doing here
 it's like that's her husband he's supposed to be living in the house
 you're here
 i don't think she's seen him in 10 years
 hey i have an idea
 can i get a beer
 let's get a beer
 she wants to be one of the group
 hey let's get a beer
 did you ever see such a phony disgusting deal
 republicans will defend your sacred right to choose the doctor and you can choose your plan and you choose the plan that's right for you
 we will strongly protect patients with preexisting conditions
 we will also protect your right to get the physician that you want
 virtually every top democrat also now supports late-term abortion ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up until the moment of birth
 this character in virginia
 did you see the virginia governor
 i mean he gave a whole expose
 the baby is born and then basically they start talking to the mother
 the baby is born
 and there's no other word
 if the mother decides no then they execute the baby
 okay
 he's the governor of virginia and why the republicans aren't going to win virginia this next election 2020
 i'll tell you what we're going to give it a very strong shot
 when you have people like that we're going to give it a very strong shot
 but that's why i've asked congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion
 because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from god
 democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late-term abortion socialism and blatant corruption
 the republican party is the party of the american worker the american family the american dream and the party of honest abe lincoln
 party of abe lincoln
 i told you about judges
 i'm telling you about so many other things
 there's nobody that's ever done what we're doing
 you look at school choice for every child in america who needs it including the 50000 pennsylvania students who your democrat governor has blocked from getting school choice scholarships
 no scholarships available
 what's that all about
 how did that happen
 i withdrew from the horrible one-sided iran nuclear deal a disaster
 i recognize israel's true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem
 for years you watched as your politicians apologized for america
 now you have a president who is standing up for america and we are standing up for the people of pennsylvania
 you've never had that better year
 never at stake in our present battle is the survival of the american nation itself
 it's the survival
 we will destroy our country if these people get in
 i say we've done so much in the first three years will soon be four years
 all of a sudden the time will be up
 but it's like when you plant a tree it needs time to grab on
 it needs time to let it… it's got to grab
 that's what we need
 we need time
 and we have other things we're going to do that are incredible
 we still have tremendous regulation cutting that we can do
 we've cut more regulations than any president in the history of our country
 we did it in less than two and a half years
 two and a half years
 we did it in less than two and a half years
 some had eight years one had more than eight years
 more regulation
 and we have regulation and you need some regulation but you don't need regulation that doesn't allow you to build a simple road or highway
 so what we've done has been incredible
 that's one of the reasons our job numbers are so good
 if you want your children to inherit the birthright of american liberty that generations of americans have fought and died for to secure then we must devote everything we have toward victory in 2020 and we have to get rid of the democrats in the house of representatives
 they are stone cold crazy
 only this way can we save the america we love and clean up washington corruption once and for all
 with your help we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity
 we have tremendous prosperity going on in our country and the people in this room are… i mean you know what's happening
 you know what's happening with your families
 you know what's happening with your jobs
 you've never had a time like this
 they always say are you better off now than you were four years ago
 i mean who is better off now
 everybody i think
 everybody
 but together we will elect a republican congress to create a fair safe sane and lawful system of immigration
 we will enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase made in the usa
 we just finished a deal with south korea a great new trade deal
 we just finished a 40 billion deal with japan
 we're in the process of getting our deal done
 let's see what happens
 they want to make it more than i do with because we're taking in a lot of money
 we haven't taken in money from china ever and it's coming in now by the billions
 when they target our farmer i give our farmers that money that they've been targeted and our farmers are thrilled
 we have a lot leftover but we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the aids epidemic in america
 we'll have that done within 10 years
 it could have started
 that could have started earlier than the beginning of our administration
 we'll have that done in less than 10 years
 think of that
 the aids epidemic will have ended in america within less than 10 years
 we will defend privacy free speech religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms
 above all we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one america one great country
 one america
 we support protect and defend the constitution of the united states
 we stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement
 we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life
 we believe that faith and family not government and bureaucracy are the true american way
 we believe that children should be taught to love our country honor our history and always respect our great american flag
 and we live by the words of our national motto in god we trust
 we stand on the shoulders of generations of pennsylvania patriots who gave their blood sweat and tears for this beloved nation
 pennsylvania's the place where our founding fathers declared american independence where the army weathered its brutal winter at valley forge and where general george washington led his men across the delaware on christmas night
 they used the password
 you know what the password was
 victory or death
 victory or death
 how incredible is that
 victory or death
 pennsylvania is the state that gave us self-made titans of american industry from andrew carnegie to milton hershey
 i love hershey
 i love hershey
 and henry j
 heinz
 pennsylvania is the place where strong american workers mine the coal work the railroads and forge the steel that made america into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of the world and we are making it even greater every single day
 it's greater than ever before
 and proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country
 we are returning power to you the american people
 they are trying to take your power away
 it will never ever happen
 with your help and with your devotion and your drive we are going to keep on working we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning winning winning
 we are going to keep on winning
 we are one movement one people one family and one glorious nation under god
 america is thriving like never before
 ladies and gentlemen of pennsylvania the best is yet to come
 because together we will make america wealthy again we will make america strong again we will make america proud again we will make america safe again and we will make america great again
 thank you pennsylvania
 thank you
