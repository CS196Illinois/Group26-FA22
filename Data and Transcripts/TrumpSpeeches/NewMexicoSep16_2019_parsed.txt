 wow thank you
 thank you new mexico
 thank you
 we love being with you
 we love being with you
 incredible people incredible people
 thank you very much
 and i'm thrilled to be here in albuquerque with thousands of hard-working freedom-loving american patriots
 thank you
 incredible
 we're all united by the same love of our great country
 and by the way our country is doing great
 you see it
 the same devotion to family and the same profound faith that america is blessed by the eternal grace of almighty god
 good night to that person
 tomorrow they'll say massive protest
 no one person just going home to mommy a little bit sooner
 good night
 but we're bound by these convictions
 we will campaign for every vote and we will win the great state of new mexico in 2020
 and by the way you have thousands and thousands of people outside who can't get in
 so we love you we love you we appreciate it
 we try to get the biggest arena we can get and they're never big enough frankly
 so there's something going on
 and i always say 2016 i don't know if there'll ever be another 2016
 but right now it's like a great tree or a great plant you plant it and it has to take hold
 we have to win 2020
 we're doing so well
 we have to win 2020
 and every day and you know as well as i do we're battling against the corrupt establishment of the past and we're achieving historic victories for the american people
 we're winning again
 we're winning again and we're winning big
 we're winning big
 crucially for your state we have ended the last administration's war on american energy
 and since my election natural gas productions big story today in new mexico has increased by 40 4-0
 and that means great wages and it means jobs
 and that's why you're breaking every single record in your state's book
 crude oil production in new mexico has more than doubled and going up a lot higher very quickly
 and your state's energy revenues are up by nearly two-thirds
 think of that
 two-thirds
 and that's in a short period of time
 give me a little bit more time okay
 the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world
 and this means more jobs higher wages and american energy independence which is what we have
 a few years ago if we had a problem like you saw two days ago in the middle east we would've been in a panic
 although not if i were your president
 we never panic
 we don't want to panic
 but a few years ago they would have been in a panic
 today we got a lot of oil we got a lot of gas
 we got a lot of oil and gas
 we don't have to send too many boats over there
 did you notice the other day they were saying we don't see too many american ships anymore
 you know why
 because we don't need … we're independent as independent as we want
 and we are now a net exporter of energy
 revenues from energy production provide up to 25 of your state's budget and going much higher in the very near future
 and they've generated nearly a billion-dollar budget surplus in new mexico
 thank you very much president trump
 thank you
 now under the green new deal that all goes away
 that all goes away
 it all goes away
 you can forget it
 no more cows no more airplanes no more trips
 a single car
 make it electric
 single car
 you're not allowed to travel more than 162 miles
 they'll call us the hermit nation
 we'll never leave our house
 no it's crazy
 but that's okay
 i don't want to bring it up because i don't want to do it too early
 maybe they'll change and i don't want them to change
 but think of it for you and for texas and for so many other places they want to get rid of your energy
 i mean explain that one
 explain that
 yet every major democrat running for president they want to abolish all production of oil and natural gas
 in other words the democrats want to completely annihilate new mexico's economy
 the democrats want us to be subservient to foreign producers
 they want us to be at the mercy of rogue regimes
 that's not happening anymore
 it's been a long time
 it's been a long time
 it's not happening anymore
 but democrats will never get the chance because new mexico will never give them that chance
 under this administration america is working again
 america is winning again
 and america is respected again like it hasn't been for a long time
 and i can tell you because i meet so many of the leaders and their presidents and their kings and their queens and their prime ministers and their everything dictators every once in a while
 every once in a while you get an a rogue dictator
 and i'll tell you they always start off today i had the crown prince of bahrain and they come in and they say sir i'd like to congratulate you on what you've done with the economy of the united states
 it's a model for the entire world
 they all say it
 and earlier today … do we have any baseball fans
 right
 right
 you know what i'm going to say
 but earlier today in the white house i had the honor of awarding the presidential medal of freedom that's the highest civilian award to someone who truly embodies the american dream baseball legend the greatest by the way the greatest relief pitcher of all time you look at those records mariano rivera
 he was something
 the yankees won a lot of world series because of mariano
 great guy
 we gave him the medal
 done so much for charity
 a fantastic man fantastic family
 it was a beautiful day at the white house so it was good
 my administration is fighting to empower all americans to reach their dreams and achieve their potential
 we have created six million new jobs since election day
 the fake news would never have allowed us to say that during the campaign even as a projection
 unemployment recently reached its lowest rate in over 50 years
 more than seven million americans have been lifted off of food stamps
 nearly 600000 americans came into the labor force last month alone
 think of that
 wages in your state new mexico are growing at a rate of much more than 3 a year which is unheard of 20 years ago
 and i used to say during the campaign you go back it's hard to believe i'm here almost three years … can you believe how time is flying
 can you believe it
 i don't know about it me but you look all much better than you did three years ago
 you're wealthier
 and even with the me too movement we can't say this but i'll say it anyway you're better looking including the men including the men
 now you're all looking good
 since my election the number of new business applications for new mexico has increased by almost 30 more than any state in the united states
 think of that
 more than any state in the united states
 so essentially that's saying you're in a certain category which is a very important category you're doing better than any state in the united states
 how do i lose new mexico
 explain that one right
 how do we lose that one
 and yet for whatever reason it's been quite a while since a republican won this state
 but we're going to win this state
 and i think we're going to win this state easy
 you had to see the people all the way in from the airport
 that was a long drive by the way 35 minutes
 that was a long drive
 but all the way in we had people and they were waving
 and i didn't see any negative hand gesture right
 no i think we're going to do great here
 and we're here for a number of reasons but we're here because we really think we're going to turn this state and make it a republican state
 yesterday marked the beginning of the hispanic heritage month
 who is hispanic here
 latinos for trump
 thank you
 incredible people
 but we have much to celebrate
 unbelievable when you think the unemployment for hispanic-americans is right now at the lowest level ever recorded in the history of our country
 hispanic-american poverty reached a brand new all-time low in history
 and after years of stagnation that you know very well wages for hispanic-americans are rising really fast up nearly 8 since my election
 those are unheard of numbers
 they're unheard of
 and median income think of that median income for hispanic-americans surpassed 50000 for the first time ever
 that's your median
 that's not bad
 that means you're wealthy and you're getting wealthier fast
 and i just want to tell you it's an honor
 but when i'm on the debate stage debating one of these far left radical democrats whoever it may be and they start telling you what they're going to do for you and you say but we have the best numbers every category that we've ever had
 hispanic-americans … excuse me new mexico as a whole we have the best numbers
 african-americans the best numbers that we've ever had in the history of our country
 asian-americans the best numbers that we've ever had in history
 women the best numbers that we've had in 71 years
 we're working night and day to deliver a future of limitless opportunity for our nation's hispanic-american citizens including millions and millions of extraordinary mexican-americans who enrich our society strengthen our country serve in our military and contribute immensely to our shared american family
 and i want to just tell you that mexico is doing a great job for us on the border and i want to thank the president of mexico
 you know it's very interesting i hear everybody screaming well you know we're building the wall and it's going up and it's going up fast
 and if you think that's easy with the democrats who control the house we have to take it back but if you think it's easy … but we're building a lot of wall
 we'll have almost 500 miles of wall built by the end the next year and it's making a big difference
 500 miles
 but you know we won a big case two months ago in the supreme court that allowed us to do what we're doing
 this has been … i'll tell you what
 ready
 another president would have given up a long time ago
 we don't give up
 so we're building the wall the army corps of engineers we're doing a beautiful job
 it's a great it's a great structure
 it's a great structure
 you're going to have to really want to get over that wall to do it
 but it was very interesting because not too long ago i saw where the hispanic-american the hispanics were up with me in a poll 17
 and everyone said how is that
 how is that
 how is that
 17
 up by 17
 i won't even tell you what the final number was because they won't believe it but you're going to see what the final number … but you know why
 because the hispanic-americans they understand they don't want criminals coming across the border
 they don't want people taking their jobs
 they want to have that security and they want the wall
 they want the wall
 and we have a man in the audience who is i think the best dressed man in this entire place including me right here
 look at him
 come here
 look at him
 look at this guy
 and he's been to a couple of rallies too haven't you
 huh
 we have some people a group of people the other day you know we had a victory in north carolina that was unbelievable
 two of them
 one of them it was going to be very very close
 here's another one of my friends
 thank you
 i like that beautiful red tie you're wearing
 but we had a victory two victories north carolina where one was 17 points down three weeks ago we got involved we started sending out lots of different social media messages we did a couple of little robo calls but the big thing we did a speech the night before
 the turnout was beyond belief
 and instead of being down by 17 points he easily won the election 4000 or 5000 votes
 dan thank you dan
 thank you dan bishop
 and greg murphy was up a couple of points and he ended up winning i don't know i'd ask the media but they won't give me how many … what did he get
 do you know
 like 20 21
 he won by a lot
 he won by a lot
 i'd asked them but we're not going to get a straight answer
 they were not happy
 they were not happy
 i'll tell you tuesday night the fake news was not happy
 they had their studios all built
 cnn had their a- list talent
 they don't have a-list talent but they had the best they could have
 and they were all set
 this was going to be the end of trump because this man was going to lose
 but he turned out to be tough and smart
 and in all fairness i helped a lot too
 and toward the end of the night they started dismantling that studio
 probably it would have been there for four weeks
 this is the end
 but we had two great victories congressional victories on tuesday night
 and it was something
 the one gentleman won by a number that nobody thought even possible so much
 and the other won a race that he was way way way back
 in fact i shouldn't tell you this but my geniuses my people some of those people standing right there right there some of them right there they said sir don't get involved in that race sir
 you can't come back from 17 points sir
 it's too much
 i said but you know i really like the guy
 i think he's great
 let's give it a shot
 they say sir if you lose they will never ever … it'll be much worse
 i said let me tell you i know them very well
 whether i help him or don't help him it's going to be the same
 it's going to be a disaster
 so let's help him
 and we campaigned and we worked hard right
 they said don't do it sir
 don't do it
 please don't do it sir
 it'll be very embarrassing
 i said no i don't mind being embarrassed
 i don't mind being embarrassed
 we're also very proud that unemployment among native americans has reached the lowest rate in nearly two decades
 and we're building an amazing future for citizens of every background race religion color and creed
 and that's what we have
 that's what we have
 race religion color and creed
 but the radical left democrats want to demolish everything that we've gained
 they want to raise your taxes
 they want to bury you in regulation
 they want to take away your health insurance 180 million americans
 they want to erase american history crush religious liberty indoctrinate our students with left-wing ideology
 and left-wing democrats want to confiscate your guns and eliminate your god-given right to self-defense
 you know that
 as your president i will never allow them to take away your liberty your dignity and your social security
 and i will never ever allow them to take away your sacred right to keep and bear arms
 the left tries to threaten bully intimidate americans into submission
 they use democrat prosecutors and phony congressional committees whenever they can
 they'll do whatever they can to demean you to libel you
 they try to blacklist coerce cancel or destroy anyone who gets in their way
 look at what they're doing today to justice kavanaugh
 look at what they're doing
 did you see the new york times
 did you see what they're doing
 did you see what democrats they're calling for his resignation
 they're calling for his impeachment
 and the woman involved said she didn't know anything
 but they still so the new york times had to put out a major apology and they had to change their story
 the woman said i don't remember that
 can you believe
 and they still want him to be impeached
 and i just put out a statement
 and he's a great man by the way a great talent
 a great brilliant man brett kavanaugh
 and i just put out a statement on social media that said i don't think they'll do it but they should for the good of the nation i call for the resignation of everybody at the new york times involved in the kavanaugh smear story
 and while you're at it the russian witch-hunt hoax which is just as phony a story
 they've taken the old gray lady do you know the new york times for years the old gray lady so prestigious they've taken the old great lady and broken her down destroyed her virtue and ruined her reputation
 she can never recover and will never return to greatness under current management
 the times is dead
 long live the new york times
 long lived the new york times
 and i do want it to live but they have to be they have to change their ways
 think of it they wrote a story about somebody that said she doesn't remember this
 can you even believe it
 and yet all of these radical left crazies are in judiciary committee and all of these committees that are set up to hurt the country
 with all that we have going with saudi arabia with iran with china trade deal with russia with north korea with all that we have going look at the cards that we've been dealt lucky we won the election in 2016 believe me
 with all that we have going they say let's impeach justice kavanaugh one of the smartest most brilliant students top at yale incredible life incredible family
 let's impeach him
 it's a made-up story
 let's impeach president trump
 think of that
 the muller report came out
 think of this
 this crazy mueller report comes out 18 trump haters liberal democrats some worked for hillary clinton they found nothing
 no think of it
 after two years they found nothing
 they spent 40 million
 there's not a person in the room that i couldn't find something on with that
 they spent think of it they found nothing
 no collusion no obstruction no nothing
 to stop the far left's campaign of destruction you must vote republican
 and you're going to get the chance very soon
 we're joined tonight by many terrific republican leaders and somebody that's done an incredible job she ran michigan for me
 and as you know for the presidential races michigan hadn't been won in decades and she kept saying could you come back sir
 i didn't know who she was
 i said who the heck is the woman in michigan that keeps asking
 she said sir if you keep coming back you're going to win michigan
 hasn't been won in decades
 and i won michigan
 remember that great great night
 november
 that great great night
 donald trump has won the great state of michigan
 and they were going crazy on television
 they were going that was not a good night- going crazy on television
 they were going that was not a good night for certain people
 remember the couple of people that were crying
 i guess they don't like a strong military
 they don't like cutting regulations
 they don't like low taxes
 they don't like right to try you know right to try
 all these things we've done
 for the vets we got choice
 we got choice for the vets
 choice
 everybody said it was impossible
 we've rebuilt our military
 i told this story for the first time today
 a general came into my office in my first few weeks you remember
 it was a little dangerous out there
 president obama left us with a few beauties right
 and i said to this general you better be prepared because this is looking like it could really be conflict
 and he looked at me and he goes sir we have very little ammunition
 i said say it again
 and i want to tell you the words very little he didn't use because it was less than that
 and i said i never want to see a president in a position like that where we may have conflict and a general looks at him and said ‘we have very little no ammunition
' i never want a president of the united states to be in that position
 and since then three years 700 billion we've spent then 716 billion
 and now 738 billion
 and our military is by far the greatest in the world
 there's nobody that even comes close
 so anyway no president should ever be put in that position
 and by the way no president should ever have to go through what i've gone through either
 that should never happen
 what happened is a disgrace to our country
 no president should ever have to go through it
 and i'll tell you what 99 of them would never have been able to take it
 they wouldn't have been able to take it
 but we won the great state of michigan and now we're doing really well because we've moved a lot of car companies
 i tell japan sorry big deficits with all these countries we're changing it but you've got to get car companies
 we're building car companies now in michigan
 they're not going to be leaving for lots of other countries including china including mexico
 they're going to stay home and they're going to pay you a lot of money and everybody's going to be happy
 but michigan's doing great
 and ronna mcdaniel was the republican party chair of michigan
 so when we won the election i said let's get the woman from michigan to run the rnc
 and she has done an incredible job
 thank you ronna
 a great gentleman who loves the republican party co-chairman tommy hicks
 tommy what a job
 new mexico republican party chairman
 steve pearce
 my friend and a really talented guy he just gets the hell knocked out of him all the time
 brad parscale
 what a job he's doing brad
 great job brad
 great job
 and another great friend of mine somebody that was on cnn and they didn't like him because he was too positive on trump
 can you believe it
 he happens to be hispanic
 he happens to be hispanic but i've never quite figured it out because he looks more like a wasp than i do
 so i haven't figured that one out
 but i'll tell you what
 there is nobody that loves his country more or hispanic more than steve cortez steve
 thank you steve
 nobody loves the hispanics more
 who do you like more the country or the hispanics
 he says the country
 i don't know
 i may have to go for the hispanics to be honest
 we got a lot of hispanics
 we love our hispanics
 get out and vote
 you know just before the last election the cubans from miami where we got a tremendous percentage of the vote close to 90
 they gave me the bay of pigs award
 can you imagine right
 the bay of pigs award
 and the venezuelans and the cubans are all for trump i will tell you that
 they're all for trump
 they like what we're doing
 with the help of and steve i want to thank you very much by the way and you were incredible on cnn and now you'll get a real job
 okay
 steve that audience wasn't big enough for you
 their ratings aren't good
 with the help of everyone here tonight we're taking power out of washington and giving it back to the great people of our country and to the people of new mexico
 we've cut a record number of job-killing regulations saving the average american household 3000
 we passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in american history
 what that means is a typical family of four in new mexico making 75000 has seen their tax bill reduced by more than 2000
 and it's one of the reasons that as the world is not doing great you look at europe and you look at asia and china's not doing too well
 i must be honest with you worst year in 57 years i'd say that's not good
 but i hope they still like me
 and we've taken in tens of billions of dollars worth of tariffs and we've given those tariffs and by the way china's eating the tariffs they're devaluing their currency the prices are very similar
 they're eating the tariffs
 and out of the tens of billions we gave our great farmers because they were targeted by china because china knows very smart that the farmers love trump and trump loves the farmers
 i said to our secretary of agriculture sonny perdue i said sonny how much did the farmers get hit by china targeting them and pulling back and doing all sorts of things
 he said 16 billion
 i said that's okay
 we'll take 16 billion out of a much much much larger number
 we're going to give it to the farmers so that they're even
 and i tell you the farmers do love trump they do love trump
 and to keep new mexico's farms ranches and small businesses in the family we eliminated the unfair estate tax or death tax so that you can now give your farm or your ranch to your children
 now if you don't like your children don't do it
 but when it's your time to kick the bucket you worked hard
 you have great kids you love your kids they're taking care of you
 you really love them
 it's a great thing
 if you don't love them don't even listen to the last line because it won't matter
 don't leave it to them
 if they're not good leave it to charity
 leave it to something else
 don't get it to them
 i know a guy who can't stand his children they're horrible horrible human beings
 they're a little older now but they're horrible human beings
 he wants to leave his wealth
 i said why would you leave them
 they don't even like you
 but on the assumption that you love your children you'll be able to use small farms and your ranches and things
 you'll be able to leave them to your children
 your children won't have to go out and borrow a fortune to pay tax
 they won't be losing it to the banks five years later
 we got rid of it
 that's a big deal
 thank you
 thank you
 our shared republican agenda is pro-worker pro-jobs pro-family pro-growth and 100 pro-american
 for many decades our leaders put global interests and special interests ahead of your interests
 you know that in new mexico you know exactly what i'm talking about
 people came in they took your jobs they had no border they had no border control
 look at what's going on now how we're doing
 i mean honestly i mentioned the president of mexico
 we have today 27000 mexican soldiers on the border protecting our country
 and i'll take it
 because our laws are so bad they're so pathetic
 and the democrats could change these laws
 they could change them so quickly
 we could change them all in less than an hour
 we could whether it's asylum whether it's any of the laws we have so many of them that are so bad
 how they got that it took years and years to end up
 but we have the mexican soldiers out there
 you see them and they're stopping people
 the numbers are plummeting down
 so i just want to thank all of the representatives of mexico
 amazing
 well we've got to get rid of the loopholes
 you know the word is loopholes and the democrats could do it fast
 but in the meantime we're doing really well
 and as the wall goes up it becomes less and less of a problem because as the wall gets up people aren't getting through
 i mean you got to be a a world class pole vaulter or a world class mount everest type climber
 there's not too many around like that
 it's really doing the trick
 the failed liberal establishment in washington squandered your tax dollars shipped away your jobs sacrificed your sovereignty and bogged us down in one foreign war or debacle call it whatever you want after another
 and that's changing also you see what's happening and when these rich countries think we're going to pay for their military every year billions and billions and billions and they're rich and they take our business and we're supposed to on top of everything else i could tell you stories but i'm going to save them for the campaign
 because to be honest this is a little earlier than the campaign
 wait until this campaign starts you know like i was telling brad and i was telling a few of the folks one thing i don't want to do michael back there michael hello
 what a job he's done
 but i'm telling them i don't want to do this too early
 i don't want to do it
 you know the pocahontas thing i did that it was before its time
 right
 it was before it's time
 too early
 1024
 that means i have more indian blood than she does and i have none unfortunately
 i'd like to say i have a lot
 got to get me another 4
 maybe another 10
 but i was early with her and frankly oh it's coming back don't worry about her
 but those days are over under this administration
 we are finally putting america first
 putting it first
 we're reversing decades of calamitous trade policies that ravished our industries and devastated communities all across our land
 you see the factories empty buildings empty hulks
 some have been demolished some have been reconverted into senior citizen housing and housing
 but all those jobs are gone and we're bringing them back
 they're coming back like almost never before
 probably i can say they're coming back like never before
 people are coming back now because they want to be where the action is
 and this is the country where they have the security and where they do have the action
 in my first week in office i proudly withdrew from the last administration's job-destroying… and this was a catastrophe
 you know the trans-pacific partnership tpp this would have destroyed the automobile business in our country
 now new mexico you know that you were totally devastated by another disaster known as nafta
 your state lost 33 of its manufacturing jobs after nafta was signed
 this was one of the great catastrophes
 and now we're replacing nafta with the brand new us-mexico-canada agreement usmca
 think of the song ymca
 ymca
 think of the song
 usmca that's us-mexico-canada agreement
 and it's drawing strong bipartisan support from all across your state and all across the country
 it's amazing
 i want to just yeah
 the dona ana county board of commissioners all democrats just unanimously endorsed the usmca and urged congress to pass it immediately
 thank you very much commissioners
 all democrats
 hopefully they'll put it up for a vote
 nancy pelosi they put it up for vote
 it's going to be very popular
 the republicans love it and the democrats love it and frankly labor loves it
 unions love it
 farmers love love love it and everybody wants it
 your farmers your ranchers everybody wants it
 it's an incredible agreement
 and mexico's already passed it and canada's ready to pass it soon as we do
 see they don't maybe trust us that's why
 they say why aren't you passing it now
 they say oh we'll pass it
 they're going to pass it as soon as we do
 past leaders invited china to freely loot and pillage the united states economy
 china's been taking out from 300 billion to 500 billion a year
 billion not million
 billion
 think of what 500 billion is
 we've rebuilt china but now it's a different ball game
 somebody had to do something with china
 president obama should have done it
 presidents bush should have done it
 president clinton should have done it
 they all should have done it
 frankly they all should have done a lot of things that we're doing right now
 so if you look at it nobody did it so i'm doing it and that's what's going to happen
 we're doing well
 so now we're taking in billions and billions of dollars from china
 when in the past we never got 25 cents
 we never got money
 we never got anything
 you know what we got
 unemployment and losses
 and some cheap pencils
 more than we needed
 you could do with one less pencil
 following decades of outsourcing and offshoring our jobs and factories are coming back home where they belong
 if foreign companies do not want to pay our tariffs there is one very simple solution
 come and make your product in america
 come and make your product in new mexico
 and by the way i'm just seeing this great group of people this spirit is there any place in the world that's more fun or more exciting than a trump rally
 really
 is there anything
 when you think about it it's not about fun
 it's about achievement
 because what we've achieved in the last almost three years is unparalleled
 there's never been an administration that in the first two and a half years has done what we've been able to do or achieve
 in a few short weeks we'll be up to 180 sounds impossible federal judges including court of appeals judges
 because president obama did us a great favor when i came in i said i assume i have no judges to appoint
 no sir you have 138 judges
 138
 didn't put them up couldn't get them approved
 i don't know what happened but we started off with 138 now we're up to 180
 i just signed my 150th federal judge and court of appeals judge and we already have two great supreme court justices gorsuch and kavanaugh
 great great men
 so think of that
 you know you come in and i've always heard the most important thing a president does i disagree with this by the way but that's okay
 i disagree with a lot of things
 because i think the most important thing is our military and protecting our country right
 but have you listened to the so-called washington elite now why are they elite
 we do better than they do we're smarter than them
 we make more money we have better houses we have better everything and then they say the elite
 that means you're the super elite
 i've always take offense when somebody said president trump is tired of listening to the elite
 i said no no i'm more elite than them
 right
 i think so
 i mean if we go by the old standards better houses better schools made much more money lived better had everything going and then i decide to run for president
 and i'll be honest while we have to put up with these people and others are it's incredible
 but it's the greatest single decision i've ever made because our country is turning around so rapidly
 i could not be happier despite what they put us all through
 could not be happier
 after years of building up other countries we're finally building up our country
 isn't that nice
 it's time to finally take care of our own
 and we're all so aggressively combating the opioid epidemic which is horrible
 and as a result of our nonstop efforts and billions and billions of dollars invested last year we saw the first nationwide decline in drug overdose deaths and it was a very big decline in nearly three decades
 30 years
 and at the center of america's drug crisis this is where the hispanics know it better than anybody
 people said oh the hispanics won't like a wall
 i said i think they're going to love it
 they won't like border security
 i think they going to love it
 you know why
 because you understand it better than other people but at the whole center of this crisis is the drugs that are pouring in and you understand that when other people don't understand it
 the border crisis every day dangerous criminal cartels smuggle vast quantities of lethal narcotics across your southern border including heroin meth cocaine and fentanyl and we're stopping them now
 you see the kind of numbers we're getting millions and millions and millions of dollars worth
 we've had some shipments where it could kill half of the country some of the fentanyl and some of the bad really bad stuff
 if it were distributed it could actually has the power to kill half of the country
 this is like a warlike situation
 that's why you're liking trump because you're not going to let that happen
 if you want to stop the drug smugglers and the human traffickers how about the human traffic and they traffic really for the most part in women that's what they traffic in it's women
 they're not trafficking in men
 they capture women and they bring them across the open borders and they don't go through ports of entry where you have guards standing there with guns and rifles and everything else
 they go out into the desert areas and they hang a left or they hang a right and they come in but now when you have a wall they can't do that
 right
 they can't do that
 and so many of these democrats that are against the wall it's common sense
 look you know what i saw the other day
 where the democrats are having their convention their national convention they just gave out a tremendous contract
 you know what it's for
 they're building a big wall around the building they're building a big wall
 a massive wall
 we should tell them open borders
 let anybody come in
 and a few years ago almost every one of these they're on tape
 that's the problem with politics
 three years ago they could say look i saw senator schumer i saw nancy… i saw all of them
 they said no we need a wall
 we must have a wall
 president obama we must have a wall
 we must stop people from coming into our country illegally
 we have to stop it
 we need a wall
 now a few years later they don't want a wall
 you know why
 because anything i want they want to do the opposite
 and that's okay
 that's the only reason
 but if you want to stop the drug smugglers human traffickers and vicious ms-3 gang members which we're taking out every year by the thousands and getting them the hell out of our country because of ice
 and if you want to stop all these people from threatening our communities and poisoning our youth you know it's poisoning our youth
 that's what it is it's nothing other than that it's very simple
 they're poisoning our youth
 you have only one choice
 you must elect republicans
 and to be honest with you you've got to elect president trump
 we need four more years
 president trump
 how about these phony democrats
 they started with russia russia russia
 that turned out to be be a fraud
 that turned out to be a fraud
 then they went to race
 do you believe that one
 race
 i'm the least racist person in this room
 then they went to recession there's going to be a recession
 oh please let there be a recession please
 because we have a better chance of defeating him if there's a recession
 and unfortunately the stock market's only a few points from its all time high which we've broken on i think it's well over a hundred times
 we broke the all time record
 and now they have a new one
 and i'm enriching myself
 let me tell you by doing this and taking this particular job which i love it will cost me billions and billions of dollars but if somebody from the middle east that i never saw before comes in and stays in one of my hotels for an evening and pays 439 emoluments
 nobody ever heard the word emolument before
 emolument nobody ever heard that word emolument
 he's enriching himself
 if somebody buys a tank of gas in scotland from an airport that i don't own and they happen to go to a hotel he's enriching himself like 20 people i'm going to lose billions of dollars and that's okay
 i expected to do that when i did it
 i didn't know what would happen if i lost
 can you imagine
 supposing i lost and we would have had the same basic rhetoric
 i mean winning was great
 supposing you know i'm doing all the things
 i'm telling you all the same sort of things
 supposing i didn't make it
 i'd have to go around
 i would've lost and lost billions then i would have been really unhappy
 but i'll tell you what i expected that when i did this in terms of opportunity in terms of certain places they can never do as well when you have this kind of rhetoric they can never do
 so i'll lose billions of dollars always expected
 they say i enrich myself because somebody is going to stay at my hotel
 it doesn't work that way folks
 and these are very very dishonest people and they know it
 so they've given up on every other hoax but it doesn't work that way
 you know it too
 you get it
 the democrat agenda of open borders places vast burdens on your communities and your schools and your hospitals and public safety all at the expense of hardworking new mexico families and throughout our country
 sheriffs and commissioners from nine mexico counties recently sent a letter to your state's congressional delegation begging them to vote for strong border security they want in new mexico
 they don't want open borders
 they don't want criminals pouring into your communities and doing what they do and we won't even talk about that
 they want strong these are people that are with you in many cases democrats
 they write letters we need strong border security
 in san diego california is very difficult
 always complaining not doing great but they wanted a wall in san diego good mayor in san diego by the way
 they wanted a wall
 and i said you know what let's build it someplace else
 because california you know once we build it they'll complain
 but then i said you know the people are pouring in
 they needed it
 they're pouring into san diego like going all over the place
 and people that had houses they didn't like people running over their gardens all day long coming in from the other side
 so we put up a wall and i thought everybody would be happy
 as soon as it was finished the day it was finished i was notified
 we didn't want the wall
 why did you do the wall
 and i will tell you in other words it's all a game
 i'd love to take the sucker down and move it right now to new mexico
 and if i did that they'd go crazy
 and they'd say please sir don't do that
 please please
 the same people that are saying we don't want a wall
 why did you put up a wall
 and i knew that was going to happen
 i told my people that was going to happen
 but they're very happy with their wall
 most of them won't say it
 they love it
 it stopped… it only stopped 99
9 of the people coming in
 and the only reason i'm not moving it to new mexico is that it would cost more money to move it than to build you a brand new beautiful wall so i'll give you a brand new beautiful wall
 … new beautiful wall i'll give you a brand-new one
 it's true
 it's true
 i actually priced it out
 it's true
 these contractors all my life i've been deal… they can find a way to make money
 sir it'll cost more money to move the wall that they built a new one
 they have it but the commission your commissioners wrote i quote our communities do not have the resources nor the budgets to handle the massive influx of immigrants we are experiencing
 this is your commissioners writing to us in washington
 our scarce resources are in danger of being rapidly depleted to the point that we will be unable to effectively care for our own citizens you and our existing homeless populations many of whom are american veterans right
 so democrats put illegal aliens before american citizens
 republicans believe that we must take care of our own citizens first
 i'm sorry
 that includes millions of hardworking lawful immigrants who waited in line followed the rules and came into our country legally
 and among those hardest hit by illegal immigration are hispanic americans who obey our laws pay their taxes contribute to our communities and play by the rules and they're the ones that want to see something done and we are doing it at a level that nobody else would be capable of doing it
 whether you're a first generation or a 10th generation every american citizen deserves a government that defends your jobs your safety your family and is always loyal to you
 your politicians have not been loyal to you
 they have been loyal to themselves
 the democrats are also trying to turn every city in america into a sanctuary for criminal aliens and that's one of the very good reasons we won on tuesday night north carolina because they let people out of their sanctuary city and what those people did i will not tell you tonight but it wasn't good
 it's one of the reasons we had big victories two of them in north carolina sanctuary cities
 and plenty of people even in california where they have sanctuary cities they don't want sanctuary cities
 the politicians do but they don't want them
 right here in new mexico democrats are trying to turn you into a total sanctuary state creating a safe harbor for dangerous criminal aliens and gang members that sanctuary policies release from jail
 now think of it
 they want to make your whole state a sanctuary state
 so when ms-13 comes in and i told you before we take them out by the thousands and they're tough
 they're tough but our ice folks are even tougher
 there's nobody tougher
 i would say naive but maybe it's much worse than that
 they're naive these politicians
 the naive politicians they don't want ice to come in
 they don't want to take these criminals out
 and if you don't take them out and they're in new mexico i got to tell you something folks
 you got problems
 you got problems
 you've got big problems
 republicans believe our cities should be sanctuaries for law abiding americans not for criminal aliens
 and republicans will always support the heroes of ice border patrol and our great law enforcement
 the democrat party… do you notice i always say the democrat party
 you know before i came they were all calling it democratic because it sounds better right
 it does
 it's much nicer
 the democratic party is much nicer than the democrat party but their name is the democrat party and i'm not looking for them to sound nice
 i want to give their name
 so i always say the democrat party but that's their name the democrat party
 frankly they should probably change it because it does… and then i'd call them the democratic party but the democrat party has never been farther outside the mainstream
 every major… that's a nasty fly
 i don't like those suckers
 i don't know about you in new mexico but i'm not into flies or mosquitoes
 i don't like snakes too much
 we have plenty of them in new york and washington a different variety
 i don't like snakes either
 we got a lot of snakes in washington dc
 we got a lot of steaks in new york
 i don't like either kind of snake
 i think i like the kind on the ground better than the ones we have in washington
 every major democrat running for president supports a massive government takeover of healthcare that would destroyed medicare as we know it today
 my administration will protect medicare and defend your right to choose the plan and the doctor that is best for you
 and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions
 the republicans will always do that
 our ambitious campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs has produced the largest decline in drug prices in more than 50 years
 you don't hear this because the fake news doesn't want to write about it
 sometimes i'll have a news conference about something that's so good and i'll say you know… i'll call my wife first lady first lady
 people love our first lady
 i'll say wait until you see television tonight and we did something that was so great whatever it may be
 we did a lot of things
 we did something so great and it won't be on but if there's something that's just slightly negative or even if it's good that they could turn negative that's what they like best
 take something good and turn it negative
 it's breaking… we have breaking news
 we have breaking news
 these are phony people but that's okay
 you know when you think of it i'm president and they're not
 crazy
 it's crazy
 you know sometimes i'll be in the oval office and i'll be with my people
 we have great people and i'll say you know and it's great comm in the oval office
 you don't like to hear about it because you don't hear about it too much
 that's not what they… but we have great comm considering it's pretty wild stuff going on in the world right
 but i'll be saying you know they don't treat us right
 they don't treat us right
 it's not fair
 it's not this
 and then i'll just sit back i'll say but we're in the oval office and they're not
 it's pretty amazing
 it's pretty amazing
 and when you have the democrat party and the press the media the lame stream media the fake news and they're partners… they are partners okay
 remember the word manufactured
 they used the word manufacturer on something never been used for that thing and every news gets the manufactured crisis started
 the next one this crisis was manufactured
 every one of them used the word manufactured
 they know what i'm talking about now
 now that's called collusion folks
 that's real collusion
 you have that and so you have the democrats you have the media their partners
 then you have the deep state
 we're getting rid of a lot of them
 i'll tell you we're finding them left and right
 boom
 you take a look at what… i'll tell you what
 i'll tell you what
 you take a look at what we're doing with all of the things
 i'm not going to get into detail but you know what i'm talking about
 clean the swamp
 that's the ultimate cleaning of the swamp
 and then i hate to say this but we have some republicans they're not good
 you call them a rhino
 they're rhinos
 the rhinos are worse and some of them are worse than the obama people right
 they're worse than the obama people
 they're worse than the clinton people but there aren't too many of them left
 they're pretty much on respirators
 they're gasping
 they're gasping for air but we do have some bad people that you wouldn't believe
 i didn't hear you
 why did you say why
 what
 i didn't hear that
 virtually every top democrat also now supports late-term abortion ripping babies straight from the mothers right up until the moment of birth and that's why i've asked congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from god
 it's true
 right
 i see it
 just like mom i see it
 democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late-term abortion and socialism
 the republican party is the party of the american worker the american family and it is the party of the american dream
 we've achieved record funding for the us military
 all of that money trillions and trillions of dollars spent all produced right here in the good old usa
 and i have to tell you new mexico i know you're going to like this
 a lot of those trillions because you know when you do the 716 and the 730 and the 700 -billion all of a sudden you're in trillions and i can save a lot of lines when i just say trillions
 a lot of that money's going to be spent in the state of the art military equipment that's being used at holloman air force base white sands missile range kirkland air force base and many other vital new mexico military installations that are going up as we speak
 that's also jobs but more importantly than even jobs incredible
 what you've done for the military new mexico is incredible and we've remembered but we're pouring a lot of money into new mexico and that means a lot of good things
 and we're investing in our nation's nuclear security including right here in new mexico and sandia national laboratories and los alamos national laboratory
 to protect american security i withdrew the united states from the horrible one-sided iran nuclear deal
 it was no good and we oppose the toughest ever sanctions on the iranian regime
 watch how that works out folks
 that'll be very good
 i recognized israel's true capitol and opened the american embassy in jerusalem
 and don't forget what i did for israel with respect to golan heights
 don't forget right
 for years you watched as your politicians apologize for america
 now you have a president who is standing up for america and we are standing up for new mexico
 and you must never forget
 get out there and vote and get ready and get everybody
 we need it because we're fighting a lot of forces including facebook i saw and google i saw
 did you see google
 he said i may have lost two-million to 10-million votes according to this character that worked at google right
 and we still won
 how the hell did we win
 everybody was against us
 how did we win
 how did we win
 this is a google executive
 from two-million to 10
5-million votes and we won
 i don't know we must be doing… i will say this
 that happened and people came from the valleys
 they came from everywhere
 they came from places that nobody's ever talked about before and it was the forgotten men and women but the truth is i know these men and women and they're the most incredible men and women in this country
 they really are
 they just never had anybody they really wanted to vote for or at least for a long time they didn't want to get out there
 they said oh boy
 oh boy
 is this the best they can do
 i mean in all fairness i don't want to go too early here
 look at the field
 did you watch the debate the other day
 we've got almost 350-million people
 i'll take it
 that's the best they can do
 we'll see
 we'll see
 you never want to get too cocky
 somebody said in the great state of texas donald trump is down two points to buttigieg
 buttigieg
 buttigieg
 they're phony polls
 you know they have phony polls
 i told this story the other night
 for six months i was hearing that i'm going to lose the state of texas and friends of mine from texas that look just like these guys
 see these two guys with the hates
 they might even be better looking
 they look just like… and they want to say i don't know about you but i know a lot about texas and donald trump is not going to be losing the state of texas
 remember that
 see they don't say it's in play
 they're too smart
 they say texas is in play
 and utah they said was it play
 all these are in play and play means we could lose them right
 it's a better term though because this way they can't get skunked but they can get skunked with me
 so what happens is on that beautiful election… was that one of the greatest coolest nights ever
 well they can never call a victory unless you absolutely have it and unless you're winning by a lot
 this is six months
 texas is in play
 you know he could lose texas
 i keep saying i go to a stadium we sell out to thousands of people lines that are miles long
 i mean and every friend of mine says you're going to win by a lot
 00 whatever time the polls in texas are closed
 donald trump has won this state of texas
 the polls in utah are closed
 donald trump has won the state of utah
 they don't even take a breath
 now if it's close like it's in play you wait two three four or five hours to see what it is but they don't even a breath because they're called suppression poles and they're no different than all of the dishonest reporting that you people see
 they're no different
 they're suppression polls and i'll tell you what
 we're going to win the state of new mexico and i'll be so surprised if we don't
 i'll be so surprised
 no we're going to win new mexico
 you know when i came here during the last election came here a little because i was told very hard to win and i came here a little but i saw great spirit
 but i didn't really have a track record because i never did this stuff before
 so i said i was going to cut your taxes
 i did
 i said i was going to cut your regulations
 i did more than any president in history and they've been there for many years
 i've been there for two and a half
 and i think the regulation cutting… like the waters of the us that was another beauty where you couldn't build a house you couldn't farm your land
 now what we've done on regulations is incredible
 i've done… i've rebuilt our military i've taken care of our vets
 look how happy our vets are with choice
 instead of waiting for two months to see a doctor or two weeks or three days they now go out
 if there's a wait they go out they get a private doctor
 they get taken care of
 we pay the bill
 and for the first time they've tried to get that for 45 years they haven't been able to get it but i'm good at getting things
 you must never forget
 the 2020 election is about one thing
 what's it about
 it's about you
 it is
 it's about you
 it's about you
 i'm doing a good job as your messenger but basically i'm a messenger
 i know what you want
 i understand that it's about your family
 it's about your future and it's about the fate of your country for your children for everybody
 it's about the fate of your country
 it's about the future of our great country
 no matter what label they use a vote for any democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the american dream
 that's what it's about
 look at venezuela
 venezuela 15 years ago was one of the wealthiest countries in the world and today very sad
 no food no water no nothing
 socialism
 we begin this campaign with the best record the best results the best agenda and the only positive vision for america
 and it's not just a little bit positive
 our country is going to be greater than it ever was
 that's where we're headed
 together we will help millions more citizens know the dignity of work the pride of a paycheck and the satisfaction of a job really well done
 with your help we will elect a republican congress to create a safe modern fair and very lawful system of immigration
 and we're going to have a lot done anyway
 we already do have a lot done
 you saw the figures last week but we're doing it the hard way
 it would be so much easier with a little stroke of the pen
 we will enact trade deals that ensure more products are proudly stamped with those beautiful beautiful words that incredible phrase made in the usa
 we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the aids epidemic in america within 10 years and we've already started that program
 it will happen
 we have the medicine
 nobody even knew that
 the aids epidemic in this country will be gone within 10 years
 we've already started the process
 it's been funded
 it's been funded
 who would've thought that
 honestly when i ran i didn't know that
 we have now the technology and what they've done with respect to aids is incredible
 what a terrible terrible period of time the world went through but we will have it ended within 10 years
 we will defeat the effort to drive up the cost of houses cars healthcare light bulbs
 right
 they took away our light bulb
 i want an incandescent light
 i want to look better okay
 i want to pay less money to look better
 does that make sense
 you pay much less money and you look much better and on top of that with the new bulbs if they break it's considered a hazardous waste site
 it's all gases inside and you're supposed to bring it back to where you bought it in a sealed container
 give me a break
 i asked the people the professionals well what do people do when it breaks
 because they break all the time
 what do they do
 nothing they throw it away
 a lot of people didn't know
 they didn't understand
 you got a much better light at a much reduced cost and it's much safer because when those other bulbs break they really are dangerous
 the gases come out they're dangerous
 these are the little things that i have to explain
 otherwise people will say what the hell are you doing with light bulbs for
 and we're trying to do the same thing with cars
 cars have so much junk on them now to save a tiny little fraction of gasoline
 they have so much junk that they're less safe
 so what i want to do is the following
 under our rules and regulations the cars are environmentally terrific but they're safer and they're 3500 less to buy right
 and the reason they're safer is because they could be a little bit heavier
 makes sense right
 they could be a little bit heavier
 i mean they make them now like paper mache
 somebody touches them and the entire car collapses
 when somebody hits me i want to be in as close to an army tank as possible
 no they're made out of paper mache
 they weigh about three pounds and if you get hit by a bus it's over
 they say what happened to that car
 no i think of it it's safer and it's less expensive by 3500 on average
 and california wants you to do the other cars and we don't
 we're going to end up in a big litigation and i'm fighting for you
 look
 look it's not the kind of thing most presidents would be fighting for because they say let them pay more
 let it be unsafe
 they listen to the environmentalists and i'm an environmentalist
 i believe in the environment
 i want the cleanest water on the planet
 i want the cleanest air
 i want a lot of things
 you know right now we have the cleanest air that we've ever had in this country
 but what are they going to do about china and india and russia and other countries that are spewing stuff
 what are we doing about them
 we're going to keep our nation clean
 but you know the universe is so big that when you talk about china the usa india you talk about these different places where a lot of bad stuff comes out right
 it's so big that it's right next to each other
 it's right next to each other
 does that make sense
 right
 it's right next to each other
 so what are they going to do
 we want to have the cleanest water and the cleanest air
 we will defend privacy
 we will defend free speech free assembly religious liberty and we will always defend your second amendment and we're doing it now
 and above all we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one america
 we support protect and defend the constitution of the united states
 we stand with our incredible heroes of law enforcement
 we believe in the dignity of work and in the sanctity of life
 we believe that mothers and fathers not washington bureaucrats know best how to raise their strong beautiful families in their loving and wonderful communities
 we believe that children should be taught to love our country honor our history and always respect our great american flag
 and we will always live by the words of our national motto
 nobody will ever take it down
 nobody will ever take it down
 we will never allow them to take it down
 in god we trust
 we stand on the shoulders of american patriots who built this country into the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth and we are going to be better than ever before and it won't even be close and we're right there
 our ancestors crossed the oceans settled a continent tamed the wilderness revolutionized industry pioneered sciences won two world wars defeated fascism and communism put a man on the moon and built the most exceptional country in the history of the world
 and every day of my presidency we will never forget that we are americans and the future belongs to us
 the future belongs to each and every one of you
 right
 with your help your devotion and your drive…  gee it's too bad
 he did it right in the crescendo
 how do you top that
 i just readied the big beautiful crescendo and this character's going back home
 it's all right
 it's two people tonight
 remember when they say massive protest at the trump rally two people
 with your help your devotion and your drive we are going to keep on working
 we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning winning winning in a win like never before
 we are one movement one people one family and one glorious nation under god
 america is thriving like never before
 and ladies and gentlemen of the great state of new mexico we love you
 the best is yet to come
 best is yet to come
