well thank you very much
 thank you
 thank you very much
 it's a great honor to be in north carolina
 we had great great luck and great people backing us in north carolina
 and i'm thrilled to be in winston salem with thousands of loyal hard working american patriots
 you are great people
 great people
 i don't know how many people here but there's a lot
 we said let's keep it down
 they didn't do too good a job but that's good
 that's good
 now these crowds i tell you it's beyond what we had in terms of enthusiasm beyond what we had four years ago in 2016 and that was a record enthusiasm and we are breaking that record by a lot
 this is the most important election we've ever had
 56 days from now we're going to win north carolina
 we're going to win four more years in the white house
 this is a choice
 and i must say this is a choice for many many decades
 i don't think you has a bigger difference and maybe you've never had a bigger difference
 this is the american dream and the other i don't want to say it because i'll get myself in trouble with the fake news back there
 but the other is a basic disaster for our country
 joe biden devoted his career to offshoring your jobs throwing open your borders dragging us into endless foreign wars along with some of his other friends and surrendering our children's future to countries like china
 remember this very simple to remember
 if biden wins china wins
 it's as simple as that
 so you have a situation where we built the greatest economy in the history of the world
 we were forced to close it because of the china plague that came in and now we've opened it
 and by the way your state should be open
 your state should be open
 any governor that does that
 and even if you look statistically it's you it's michigan it's a couple of others
 they're closed
 new york
 look what they're doing in new york what they're doing to our beautiful new york
 it's so sad
 but you just take a look at what's going on in north carolina
 they want to open
 they want to open
 they want to open in michigan so badly
 they want to open
 they want to have football
 they want to have their schools open
 and it's a shame what's going on
 and i'll tell you what on november 4th every one of those states will be open
 they're doing it for political reasons
 they're doing it for political reasons
 they think by hurting the economy by keeping all these store owners and all these people that work in shops and stores and buildings offices they think by keeping them and hurting them you're hurting the economy
 our economy is doing phenomenally well
 and it's not only is it a v it's a super v
 you see what's happened
 we just had a jobs number come out 1
4 million
 it's down to 8
4
 nobody thought that 8
4
 so we had the greatest economy we closed it up and now we're opening it up and your state should go with it
 we're opening it up
 and we will have a great third quarter
 it's going to be announced by the way just before the election but we're going to have a great third quarter
 we have unbelievable retail numbers unbelievable numbers all over
 and this is that super v
 but next year is going to be one of the greatest years in the history of a country economically unless the wrong person gets in and quadruples everybody's taxes in which case you will see a depression the likes of which you haven't seen
 and remember this if biden wins the violent mobs you see these mobs all over the place
 they're biden people
 they're biden states and cities
 they're democrat states
 if they win the mobs win
 you see these guys they go around saying yeah i want your meal
 give me that food
 give me that
 a woman sitting there she wants to eat
 and they come and they grab her food
 they grab her drink
 nobody's ever seen stuff like this
 this is all that ideology
 we're not going to let it happen
 we're not going to let it happen
 and in portland you see what happened last night they arrested over 50 people the first time
 we said either do it or what going in
 we're going to have to go in do it
 let us go in
 we're saying i spoke to the governor of oregon the other day
 let us go in
 i said let us go in
 we'll straighten it out in less than a half an hour
 now the us marshals did go in to take care of that one guy who killed somebody
 you saw that
 he killed a young man in the middle of the street violently
 he had other charges against him
 and i put out when is he going to be arrested
 and they went in about 15 minutes later
 and i'll tell you what our federal government is so ready to go
 all they have to do is call us
 it'll all be solved very quickly
 they have to call them
 but all of these places are democrat run places radical left run places
 they don't know what the hell they're doing
 if biden wins the rioters arsonists and anarchists win
 he said the other day well if i win that doesn't mean that's going to stop
 he doesn't he will never stop
 if they win it's not going to happen hopefully
 because this is not like a second place crowd
 let's face it
 are you seeing
 are you seeing all the polls numbers are coming out
 that's why he left
 finally he left his basement
 he said we got problems
 i don't think he knows that but the people that manage him know it
 they understand it
 he doesn't
 so i'm running for reelection to keep jobs at home to put violent criminals behind bars and to ensure the future belongs to america not to china and other countries
 because if we win america wins
 you know that
 you've seen that
 over the last three and a half years we've secured america's borders fixed our broken trade deals and they were broken like you've never seen
 they weren't even broken
 they were bad
 they were bad from day one
 rebuilt the awesome power of the united states military obliterated the isis caliphate 100
 in fact i got it down to 98
 remember a year and a half ago i got it down to 98
 and they all said no no it's got to be a 100
 i said somebody else could finish
 we want to get home
 they said no you've got to finish it so we took another two months we finished it and we're bringing them home
 we're bringing them home
 these great great warriors
 people don't like it when i say that
 secured american energy independence and built the greatest economy in the history of the world
 and now we are very simply we're doing it again and we're on track to have as i said the best year we've ever had next year
 you just had the best year
 you just had the best year of the history of your state last year
 we've created a record breaking 10
6 million jobs in the last four months
 but if sleepy joe biden takes power the economy will collapse
 he won't even know the difference
 how's the economy
 not good sir
 we're in a depression
 we are
 what's that
 joe biden who spent 47 years shipping north carolina jobs to china and other countries you know that
 and i've spent the last four years bringing jobs back to our country
 we've never had so many jobs
 we're up to 160 million jobs
 we were never anywhere close
 we got up to 160 million and we were never anywhere close to that
 here in north carolina voting is already underway
 on november 3rd americans will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity or whether we allow the same left wing extremists that have no idea what they're doing to burn down buildings or take control of government set fire to a whole country
 you know when they started knocking down the monuments and statues a few months ago i signed a very strong executive order
 you want to knock them down
 that's fine
 but you go to jail for 10 years
 it was amazing
 it was amazing how that stopped
 and then they said well we'll do it easily
 we'll do it through the process because they don't want to spend 10 years
 you know they'd look at it
 they'd say not worth it
 10 years is too much
 but the dc committee did you see about that
 they want to change the name of the washington monument
 they want to get rid of the lincoln monument jefferson monument
 now we're talking the big stuff
 they finally hit the big time took them awhile to get there
 but i said that was going to happen
 don't worry about it
 you don't have a thing to worry about
 if our foreign adversaries were devising a scheme to cripple america they could hardly do better than the biden kamala harris kamala
 remember kamala
 she started at 15
 she was supposed to win
 problem was she went from 15 to 14 to 12 to 10 to seven to four
 it's like a free fall
 you know what people don't like her
 nobody likes her
 she could never be the first woman president
 she could never be
 that would be an insult to our country
 biden wants to impose a 4 trillion tax hike a ban on american energy eliminate america's borders confiscate your guns
 he wants to get rid of your second amendment
 we're going to be appointing very pro crime judges but they want to destroy your suburbs
 you know the rule the regulation that i just terminated
 they want to build low income projects in the suburbs
 they've been doing it
 they've been destroying suburbs
 we're not doing it anymore
 somebody said suburban women how's trump doing
 but do you remember last time too
 they said women don't like trump
 i said i think they do
 i think they do
 they said women don't and then we did great with women
 and remember that great
 was that one of the greatest evenings ever
 four years ago
 that was one of the greatest
 but one of the things they did first of all we did much better
 now we're doing really well
 african american vote much better hispanic vote much better
 he did better with african americans than we thought
 he did better with hispanic than we thought
 he did better with asians than we thought
 he did really well with women
 what's this all about
 ladies and gentlemen
 and they said donald trump is projected the winner of 2016
 you remember that evening
 was that the craziest
 that was the craziest thing
 and they thought i think they didn't think it but i'll tell you what anything we had then we have much more now
 they don't understand
 they do understand it
 they do
 right
 they understand it
 look at that beautiful dress
 and she wears that dress right through the middle of hollywood and everyone says thank you very much
 beautiful
 like it
 but they want to indoctrinate your children and implement a ruin or shutdown of the united states economy again
 biden said the other day well if the experts told me
 we're not shutting it down again
 we don't have to
 we learned about the disease
 we did the right thing
 we saved millions of lives
 people don't realize we saved millions of lives and hundreds of thousands of lives by not letting china
 we put a ban on china heavily infected
 and biden was against it
 three months later he said he did the right thing i have to admit
 it's clear why both china and the flag burning rioters want biden to win
 they know his policies will be the downfall of america and they know my policies will lift america to new heights of national greatness like we've never seen before
 that's what's happening
 that's what's happening
 and never forget they're coming after me because i'm fighting for you
 there's a lot of truth in that one
 and they do come after me
 they do come after me
 they have more things to say about me
 every day it's something
 they said you see the plane where it is
 sir would you like to take the car
 i say why
 i'm saying what
 well i heard you had a limp
 i do
 i don't know about a limp
 i don't have a limp
 hey someday i'm going to have a limp
 i'll let you know when
 you'll see it
 no they make this stuff up
 they make it up
 they make stuff
 it's called disinformation
 they give a phony deal out
 they did it two days ago with the military
 there's nobody that loves the military more than me
 i was very lucky though
 i had 15 incredible american patriots that came by and they said he never said that
 they were there
 they were there
 but they make up stories horrible stories many many
 hey look look at last time the fake dirty dossier
 it was all made up
 and frankly if the shoe was on the other foot if it was on the other foot you'd have many people 20 25 people right now in jail for two years and they'd be there for 50 years because they got caught spying on our campaign and it's treason or whatever else you want to call it
 and it's a disgrace that it's taken this long
 it's a disgrace that it's taken this long
 and let me just tell you a little secret
 obama got caught and so did sleepy joe biden
 remember biden just sitting in the room saying why don't you use the logan act on general flynn
 look at general flynn what he's going through for years
 if that were ever reversed i'm telling you you'd have many people in jail for many many years and it would have started three years ago
 it's a disgrace but let's see what happens
 biden's a globalist sellout who spent his career laying waste to american communities
 and you know he talks about like well he's going to do this
 he's going to … he doesn't have any idea
 he has no clue
 he's going to do this
 he's been there for 47 years
 and he just really left
 he left three and a half four years ago
 so he just left but he's been there for 47 years
 i'm going to do this
 after 47 years he's had a change of heart
 this is the craziest election
 this is the craziest … look somebody said what's the difference between crooked hillary clinton and slow joe
 so the difference is the following
 she's meaner probably not as nice
 i don't know
 you can't get any worse than her when you think
 but the big difference is she's smarter than he is
 okay
 he's a nicer person but he's not smart
 he never was not in prime time and certainly not now
 the washington vultures ripped apart our towns in exchange for his party's nomination
 biden has now formed an unholy alliance with the most extreme and dangerous elements of the radical left you know that with crazy bernie and everyone
 and by the way you know who's further left than crazy bernie
 kamala kamala kamala
 you remember she left the race
 sort of interesting that they picked her because in theory they should be able to win in california
 i don't know
 maybe we'll make a play for that one too
 but they picked somebody from california
 i don't quite get it but you always pick somebody that's hot
 that's going up in the polls going up
 frankly i'm not sure
 i don't think i've ever said this but probably hillary should have picked bernie sanders to be her running mate
 right
 because as crazy as it sounds he was hot
 he gave her a hell of a fight
 a lot of people think he won and it got taken away
 one thing about bernie he's the greatest loser i've ever seen because look any children here
 no not too many but they've heard it before
 he got screwed four years ago and he got screwed again
 biden got the nomination
 he got the nomination
 but if biden would have sat back and if elizabeth warren pocahontas you remember pocahontas
 she finally faded
 she faded badly
 but if she would have dropped out on super tuesday prior to super tuesday bernie would have been the nominee
 and i don't know who i'd rather run against
 one is super left
 the other one's had to become super left
 one is competent
 the other one is only half competent now and heading south
 he's half competent and heading south rapidly
 but the globalists and the leftists make natural partners because they're united by their contempt for the american middle class in the truest sense
 that's why powerful corporations and far left politicians have both sided with radical demonstrated over
 if you look at that it's over the law abiding areas that we have
 republican cities and towns are doing great
 we're doing great
 and we don't have crime and we don't have this violence
 chicago over the weekend many people killed many people shot shot
 they're actually shot and killed
 new york the same thing
 new york's gone through the roof
 they were up 300 in certain categories
 and you say what's happening
 and we want to send them in so badly
 joe biden and his party spent the entire summer cheering on the rioters rampaging through a democrat run cities falsely labeling them as peaceful protesters
 and you know we call you peaceful protesters you know why
 because they have rules in these democrat run states that if you're campaigning you can't have more than five people
 they- that if you're campaigning you can't have more than five people
 they did that for me
 if you are going to church you can't go to church anymore
 you can't go to church
 you can't go to church you can't do anything
 you have to stay in your house but if you're willing to riot running down main street if you're willing to riot and stand on top of each other's face and do whatever the hell you want to do you're allowed to do that because you're considered a peaceful protester so we decided to call all our rallies peaceful protests even my people my very brilliant consultants who i don't listen to too much maybe i should
 sir please don't say law and order
 that's too tough
 now in the meantime you look at these streets people crazy
 they say say law and order but with safety
 i said look people get it
 it's just law and order is that okay
 we want law and order
 they say law and order and safety sir
 could you add the word safety
 because it's … i said i don't want to add
 it's sort of obvious right
 we want law we want order
 biden is fueling the violence with his relentless attacks on police and his constant slander that america is racist
 by the way i've gotten the support of almost every police group in the country
 sheriffs in florida ohio texas north carolina
 all over the country but did you notice he's starting to talk a little bit tougher now did you notice that
 he sees what's going on his polls are dropping like a rock and he sees what's going on
 now he's starting to say no we need law and order
 no he didn't say that did he
 he'll never get to say that can't say that because then it'd lose the whole left and let me tell you the left is running that party
 you take a look at … you don't want to be dealing with the left
 these people are stone cold crazy you don't want to be dealing
 meanwhile biden he doesn't say a word about the thousands of african-americans who are murdered each year as a result of violent crime in democrat-controlled cities
 they're murdered by the thousands and they never ever mention it
 my heart is with the hardworking patriots of all backgrounds who build up our communities not the violent criminals and extremists and agitators and anarchists who burn them down
 next time you see video of screaming far left maniacs shouting wildly at peaceful americans remember this
 these are biden supporters and if he wins they will be in charge of your government as sure as you're sitting there
 you'll be taking your monuments down
 you'll be taking your statues down
 i'm not kidding you'll be taking them down
 you have to look at the d
c
 report i'm just telling you go get it you wouldn't even believe it
 it's too crazy to even talk about but we're never going to give them a chance to do it
 we're never giving them a chance
 we're going to win we're going to win big
 this is a very important state and by the way … by the way when they send out their millions and millions of unsolicited ballots when you get a ballot say well i wanted to go and vote darling
 i wanted to go and vote
 why are they sending me those ballots
 there's something really … the only way we lose north carolina and a couple of others like nevada we're doing great there
 now the governor decides we're doing so well that they're going to send out unsolicited
 you have solicited and unsolicited
 they're going to send out millions of ballots to you
 people that never really thought in terms of it
 now sometimes you'll ask for a ballot
 that's a solicited ballot
 it's okay you have to go through a process you have to sign the form you get it
 sending out millions of unsolicited ballots
 make sure you send the ballot in and then go to your polling place and make sure it counts
 make sure it counts
 because the only way they can win is by doing very bad things
 that's the only way as far as the eye can see but they'll correct it
 they'll say he's wrong it was 14500 he's misrepresenting
 he's misrepresenting
 now i was told we have 15000 and we're in the middle of an airport someplace
 it's a wonderful thing
 i actually think … i don't know if you agree
 so we go to the arenas but because of china the arenas aren't working out too well right
 you can't really do that anymore for a while but we are rounding the turn i will tell you we're rounding the turn on that but because of that … so we said where because we have the same crowds
 i think we have bigger crowds potentially
 we were in new hampshire the other night we had to turn away 8000 people at an airport
 we're doing all mostly hangar things because we're outside
 outside is very much different than being inside according to the great doctors right
 but they say it's very much different
 so we're doing these and we're doing the outdoors we're doing the hangars but i really believe that these crowds are bigger than they were four years ago
 it's pretty amazing
 it's pretty amazing
 we started off in new hampshire we said look let's have 1000 people and they had like five or six show up and they had thousands more
 we're trying to be nice but then eventually we landed … two weeks ago we landed in new hampshire and the entire runaway was lit up with thousands and thousands of people as the plane was landing and i mean it's really amazing what's going on
 all over the country it's amazing
 it's amazing
 it's a great thing
 more support than we had four years ago because four years ago i said i was going to do this i was going to cut your taxes i was going to cut regulations i was going to get right to try i was going to take care of your vets i was going to rebuild your military i was going to do all these things and you said i don't know
 that's a lot of … you know what
 i've actually done more than i promised
 build a wall build a wall true
 i've done more
 for instance you never heard me say you never heard me say a lot of you were at various rallies you never heard me talking about space force
 we built think of it
 a new branch of the united states military the united states armed forces called air force
 i never talked about that
 that's something we never talked about
 i only figured that one out after i became president because i saw what russia was doing and what china was doing
 i said we have to do the same thing and if you think that was easy that was not easy
 that was not easy it was very hard
 but what we've done … you know the wall now is past 300 miles
 it's exactly the wall that our great border patrol wanted
 i was hoping a nice concrete plank for the builders in here boom boom you put it
 sir we have to be able to see through
 i said all right let's go
 much more expensive
 i said let's go
 so we're over 300 miles now and we will be finished with it very soon and we have among the safest borders that we've ever had by far and it's a good time to have it too
 that's right
 mexico is going to pay for it
 what happens if they fight us
 remember that answer
 it's going to get 10 feet higher
 remember that
 what happens if they fight us on the wall
 the wall's going to get 10 feet higher but now mexico and i get along great
 in fact they have 27000 soldiers along our southern border protecting us from people coming to our country
 can you imagine that
 27000 and i did that so that we don't put tariffs on their products coming in it was very simple
 i said you got to do it and the president's been great he's a friend of mine he's doing a very good job
 not easy mexico's not easy but he's doing a very good job but the wall is almost completed and it's a tremendous wall
 it's everything that the border patrol wanted
 i gave them everything
 i said what else do you want
 it's wired for every single thing you could have
 remember the democrats we don't want a wall we want drones flying
 oh that helps us a lot drones so you can watch everybody pour in to our country right
 biden supports cutting police funding and he has pledged to end cash bail
 just last week sleepy joe proudly accepted the endorsement of the pro-criminal anti-police portland district attorney who has a policy of releasing rioters vandals criminals and violent extremists without charge
 now last night though they arrested more than they've ever done because we said you have to
 we said you have to and we told them about … we will federalize them we'll do whatever you need and i spoke to the governor it looks like they're finally after 107 days like they're finally doing what they're supposed to be doing but we'll let you know very soon
 otherwise we're going in
 the biden-bernie manifesto pledges to implement these same policies nationwide
 now you got to understand bernie's a radical lefty but not as bad as her but a radical left and i got a lot of bernie voters
 i think 15 last time because they agree with me on trade
 they understand that many of these countries including our so-called allies are ripping us off they're ripping us off on trade
 i agree with him on that
 the difference is i know how to do something about it they don't
 they don't have a clue
 they just know they're being ripped off and a lot of bernie people feel that
 that's a big point and they came over and they voted for me instead of crooked hillary which was a very nice thing
 we appreciate it we hope we don't lose it
 because we've really implemented things
 we've taken in billions and billions and billions of dollars for china from china and china's never given us 0
10
 it's a one-way street with china
 they haven't given us … we signed a great trade deal but the ink wasn't dry when the plague came in so i view that trade deal much differently than i did before much differently
 it's a great deal
 they just last week they ordered the biggest order of corn in history the biggest order of soybeans in history and i say just shows you though they're smart very smart
 instead of saying he's not talking very nicely about us and we're not going to order any more we're not going to do business no
 instead they do the opposite
 they give us the biggest orders … our farmers are very happy
 our farmers are very happy
 biggest order of corn biggest order of beef biggest order of soybeans and i gave the farmers 28 billion because that's what you were targeted for by china and i gave you 28 out of the tariffs and we had tens of billions of dollars left over which went into the u
s
 treasury but nobody's ever done this before
 nobody's ever done this before
 with biden it's the reverse
 his son goes sits down for 10 minutes with the father and whoever the hell they sat down with
 walks out with one and a half billion dollars to manage he'll make millions of dollars a year and he has no experience at all
 never happened before
 biden's plan is to appease the domestic terrorists
 my plan is to arrest them
 so on november 3 america faces a very simple choice
 do what you want vote for the candidate backed by violent left wing rioters if you have to or do what you want to vote for the candidate backed by the selfless heroes of law enforcement and just about everybody else
 wait till you see the numbers
 wait till you see the numbers
 you know there was a poll that just came out i think it was gallup and it was a weird kind of a poll because it said 62 of the people that are polled are lying
 i said that's a big number right
 i think it was 62 a couple of weeks ago it came out and they're only lying if it's us because they don't want to be bothered
 in other words they're not lying about sleepy joe they're lying about us and i don't know if i'm supposed to love that or hate it i don't know if it's an insult or not but i will take it
 we don't give a damn
 if that's the case we have a virtual landslide going
 we have a virtual landslide and this would look like it it would have been terrible but you know what
 fortunately we had really talented people taking down everything word for word
 we had the call perfectly and if i didn't have it somehow with these people i guess i'd still be here if you want to know the truth but it was a lot easier but we were 196 to nothing the republicans stuck together and kevin mccarthy's done a fantastic job
 he really has
 with the exception of a half a vote from mitt romney you can have him
 he's not too popular i want to tell you he's not a very popular guy in utah
 he's not too popular
 so it was 52
5 to a half
 he's a beauty i'll tell you that guy
 he couldn't get elected dogcatcher in utah right now
 remember utah they said it's too close to call this was before the election and they announced utah the polls are closed donald trump has won the state of utah
 do you remember that like immediately
 i won by a lot and there was some guy running mcmuffin mcmuffin
 mcmuffin he was supposed to be second
 even hillary beat him
 what a group
 lieutenant governor dan forest dan
 get out and vote for him
 get out and vote for him okay
 i'll tell you he'll be a great governor
 he loves your state he'll be a great governor
 thom is going to be a great great senator for another six years we need them both and i hope you're going to do well dan
 i know you're really getting up there it's getting very close
 i'll be honest if this governor that you have i know him
 you know we had to take our convention away he said you're allowed to have 10 people in the arena 10 because it said one room 10 you're not supposed to have political rallies
 i said you know the money that your state is going to be losing
 but if this guy doesn't open up your state because almost all of them are open now if he doesn't open up your state you have no choice you're going to vote for him anyway but dan you'll be so good
 dan forest go and vote
 the republican nominee for north carolina attorney general jim o'neill
 jim
 where is jim
 thank you jim thank you very much
 good luck
 got to be careful with those ballots watch those ballots
 i don't like it you know you have a democrat governor you have all these democrats watching that stuff
 i don't like it
 i look at these crowds and if they're going to cheat crowds are meaningless
 really if they're going to cheat these big beautiful crowds you could have 15000 you could have 50000 these crowds are meaningless
 watch it be poll watchers when you go there
 watch all the thieving and stealing and robbing they do
 because this is important we win north carolina we win
 we're going to win florida i just left florida we're going to win florida
 north carolina republican party chairman michael whatley north carolina great

 robert thank you very much and thank you all for being here
 mick it's good to see you
 oh wait a minute wait
 it's a very very outstanding senator
 oh i'm lucky i got to see that
 we love south carolina right
 come here
 lindsey graham everybody lindsey graham
 lindsey and tim scott two great ones
 two great ones
 they may be from a different state but they love you lindsey
 that's good and tim is another one
 so we have just incredible people in the party
 we've achieved more in four years than anyone ever thought possible and that's driving them crazy
 we passed massive tax cuts like nobody ever thought was possible for hardworking families and we eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations more than any president in history whether it was four years eight years or in one case more regulations and to keep family farms in the family we eliminated the unfair estate tax also known as the death tax on your small farms and businesses
 remember that was a terrible thing
 people were fighting for that your family lost the farm lost – 53
 no but it was a terrible thing
 you'd pass away and your kids would get the farm they'd go out and borrow a lot of money because the estate tax was massive
 they'd put big mortgages on the farm they'd lose the farm they'd lose the business
 you don't have that anymore
 i saved the us auto industry by withdrawing from the last administration's job-killing catastrophe the trans-pacific partnership was a disaster
 for half a century joe biden shook hands with blue collar workers and then he turned around and immediately stabbed them in the back
 biden supported nafta china's entry into the world trade organization tpp the south korea disaster deal and mass amnesty for illegal aliens
 think of it
 but the big deal is he's changed
 he's changed
 after 47 years i've changed
 i swear to you i've changed
 did you see him in the debates
 he was not too good but that's okay
 he was better against bernie
 something's going on there i don't know
 you know what i'm talking about
 but he was better against bernie
 but in the other debates he was giving them everything they want
 free healthcare for people that come into the country illegally colleges everything
 now the new deal under the new deal they get lawyers
 if they come in to our country illegally we supply them with legal advice
 you believe it lawyers
 this is what we need is more lawyers
 this state lost 43 of all manufacturing jobs after the twin disasters of nafta and china's entrance into the world trade organization
 that's courtesy of biden and his friends
 earlier this year i kept my promise to north carolina when we ended the nafta nightmare and we signed the brand new us-mexico-canada agreement into law it's been incredible
 everyone said impossible
 they all said it was impossible to get done we got it done
 and it's a great deal
 and it prevents people it prevents companies from fleeing your state opening up in mexico or canada making a product selling it to us with… it's such a disincentive to do that
 now that was the thing that was most important to me
 i used to hate when i'd see all these companies leaving our country going to mexico in particular but canada also a lot of them going to canada and they'd make a product everybody gets fired in our country they close their business and they make the same product in a different country they send it back to us no tax at the border no tariff no nothing
 it doesn't work that way anymore
 i took the toughest ever action to stand up to china's pillaging plundering ransacking and rampant theft of north carolina jobs and us jobs
 joe biden's agenda is made in china my agenda is made in the usa
 in the face of china's economic aggression we provided a historic 28 billion in relief to our amazing farmers
 i will always stand with american agriculture
 these are the greatest people the finest people and we're not going to let others take advantage of them
 for 20 years for 20 years you look at a chart it's just been this way for 20 years
 now it's going back up
 i mean it helped that i gave you 28 billion in all fairness right
 if i didn't do that and i took it all from china it was very easy
 if i didn't do that i think you wouldn't have any farmers right now
 really
 it was a difference between having farmers that are doing well and having no farmers
 28 billion over two years they got hit one year 16 billion one year 12 billion
 i said to sonny perdue secretary of agriculture great guy an ex-farmer governor of georgia for eight years great guy
 i said sonny how much are they being targeted for
 he said sir 12 billion for the year before and last year sir was 16
 so i said 28 okay that's fine
 i said we will give them 28 billion
 they were unfairly targeted
 and that was in order to get me and by the way china wants joe biden so badly
 oh they want… and you know who else would like them very badly
 iran would like them very badly
 because i ended that iran catastrophe that we paid 150 billion and 1
8 billion in cash
 and you know what's going to happen
 they're just waiting for the election because the country is going down the tubes
 their gdp went down 24
 nobody ever heard of that before
 their country is in trouble
 i don't want them to be in trouble but they're going to wait till after the election
 when i win the election they're going to come to us and make a deal so fast
 watch how fast it'll be
 they're dying to make a deal but they do want to wait
 let's wait two months maybe we'll get lucky
 maybe we're going to get lucky and slow joe gets in and we're going to make a great deal
 no there'll be in immediately after the election and they'll make a deal we'll make a fair deal with them
 but what obama did and biden did with that horrible iran deal
 i ended last administration's war on american energy
 biden has pledged to end production of american oil shale clean coal no fracking wiping out millions of jobs and forcing us to buy energy from foreign polluters
 we don't want to buy energy
 we've done that for a long time for decades and decades
 we don't want to do that anymore
 i like being energy independent don't you
 and i'm sure that most of you notice when you go to fill up your tank of gas in your car oftentimes it's below 2
 you said how the hell did this ever happen
 thank you president trump
 right
 thank you president trump and look at your electric bills everything else
 these guys your electric would go up four five six times
 the green new deal it's called the green new nightmare
 while i'm president america will remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas on earth and we will remain energy independent
 it should be for many many years to come
 because the fact is we don't have to be in the middle east other than we want to protect israel
 we've been very good to israel
 but other than that we don't have to be in the middle east
 we don't need… there was a time we needed desperately we don't need that anymore
 we have more than they do isn't that nice
 after years of rebuilding other countries we are finally building our country
 america first
 it's america first
 to bring hope to our inner cities i created opportunities zones
 i worked with senator tim scott of south carolina what a great guy
 he has passed criminal justice reform prison reform delivered permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities that obama never did or couldn't do
 and biden
 i call it obiden
 o biden
 it's too long to say obama and biden just call it obiden
 and before the china virus we achieved the lowest african american hispanic american asian american unemployment rates ever recorded
 and we're heading back to that level rapidly
 biden spent the last 47 years betraying african american voters
 he betrayed them
 look at 1994 take a look at that
 he betrayed them what he did to them
 he closed the factories in baltimore and sent them to beijing
 they were all sent to beijing
 so many people went there
 they went to all parts of the world but a lot went to beijing
 he shattered the plants in chicago and sent them to shanghai
 unlike the previous administration under my administration we put america first
 and actually if we weren't interrupted with constant investigations that went nowhere
 and nobody has been through what i've been through as president of the united states nobody
 they used to say abraham lincoln got the worst press
 i said there's no way he got worse than me
 but lincoln was very very badly treated by the fake news
 maybe in his case it was real
 i can tell you in my case it's fake
 it's totally fake
 but nobody's been and should never be allowed to happen again
 let's see what happens
 we caught them cold
 let's see what happens
 but if we didn't have to… that takes time and energy and all other things
 31
 she could have said okay
 she could have said you got me
 but she said i got set up by the beauty parlor owner who happens to be a trump person by the way
 i like the beauty parlor owner
 she said i got set up by the owner of the beauty parlor
 she set me up
 i said how are you going to deal with putin kim jong-un and president xi of china
 no it's terrible she's always preaching about the mask
 you got to wear the mask at all times indoor outdoor
 when you go to bed at night put the mask on
 i've spent the last four years keeping my promises and delivering for the african american community and when i'm reelected the best is yet to come
 i'll tell you that
 perhaps in no area have our opponents more thoroughly betrayed working families of all backgrounds than on the subject of immigration
 under my administration we've achieved the most secure border in american history
 now i have to tell you the 300 miles of wall helps a lot
 remember they said walls are old fashioned
 they don't work
 really
 i always say and i've said it four or five times
 i'll say it again if you'd like me to two things if you come back in a thousand years 2000 years or 3000 years
 if you're lucky enough assuming we have something with the world is a crazy place isn't it
 but if you come back in a thousand years there are two things with all the computers and all the everything changes every day you invent a new cell you invent a new laptop
 everything is obsolete like about two weeks after you invent it right
 two things that will never get obsolete the wall and the wheel right
 the wheel and the wall
 maybe i'm wrong who knows
 but i would say walls and wheels have a great future
 we ended catch and release stopped asylum fraud and we've deported 20000 gang members including the radical ms-13
 we invested 2
5 trillion in the united states military all made in the usa by the way we have the newest finest military we've ever had and gave our great warriors their largest pay raises in many many decades
 we passed va choice and va accountability which everybody said could not happen and veterans satisfaction with the va has just reached 91 the highest satisfaction level in history
 i withdrew from the last administration's disastrous iran nuclear deal as i said and i kept my promise and recognized the true capital of israel and opened the united states embassy in jerusalem
 and then i recognized israeli sovereignty over the golan heights and we achieved the first breakthrough in the middle east peace for many many decades decades
 even the new york times said that was an amazing achievement
 do you believe that
 i said let me see that one
 now we did something that nobody thought was possible
 man it's israel as you see and as you've read israel and uae highly respected leader mohammed highly highly respected and now we have other countries in the middle east
 they all want to come in
 it's going to be a beautiful picture going to be a beautiful picture
 we killed the vicious founder and leader of isis al-baghdadi we killed him
 why didn't biden get him
k they were after him for eight years they never got him i got him
 the world's number one terrorist and the mass murderer of american crews qasem soleimani we got him too
 soleimani
 al-baghdadi and soleimani the two worst terrorists in the world for many many years many decades
 we kept america out of new wars and we're bringing our troops back home
 we're bringing them back home from all these far away places
 we spend hundreds of billions of dollars and what do we get out of it
 biden voted for the iraq war he supported the defense sequester that gutted our military he opposed the mission to take out osama bin laden he opposed the killing of soleimani he oversaw the rise of isis and for eight years he couldn't find or kill al-baghdadi the founder of isis
 couldn't find him they looked they couldn't find him
 i found him and we hit him good
 we hit him good
 and you saw the mueller family on television
 you saw that at the convention what al-baghdadi did with their beautiful daughter and incredible how our troops handled that
 you should see it it was incredible
 biden also cheered the rise of china as a positive development positive development for america and for the world
 how are we doing with china
 we just have the plague we've had other plagues sent by them
 i wonder if they did it on purpose what do you think
 i got to tell you i was sailing to an easy election
 this was going to be so easy
 i probably would have not been here tonight
 i would have said no we don't have to bother
 this is going to be… and now we have to work against a guy that doesn't know where he is i can't believe it
 when i banned travel from china biden called it hysterical and xenophobic
 do you remember that
 i banned it
 everybody told me no no no you don't have to do that
 but i said we have to because wuhan is very infected and they're coming here so i banned it
 later on it was said to be a great move
 if we had listened to joe hundreds of thousands more americans would have died
 if biden wins china will own america and it won't take long with his son hunter walking out with all of that money with no experience whatsoever no investment…he didn't even have a job
 joe biden is weak and will always cave to china who is strong
 when the virus arrived we launched the largest national mobilization since world war ii
 we're delivering life-saving therapies and we have achieved some of the great numbers
 the case fatality rates we have the lowest of any major country in the world
 people don't know that because the fake news doesn't want to write about it
 under operation warp speed we're producing a vaccine in record time
 this is a vaccine that we're going to have very soon very very soon by the end of the year but much sooner than that perhaps
 and this is something that's incredible
 this would have taken two or three years by the last administration and in all fairness by most other administrations
 we have upped it to a level that nobody even believes is possible and totally safe
 joe biden and kamala harris rated the most liberal are undermining science and risking countless lives with their reckless anti-vaccine rhetoric
 that's what they're talking about
 so now they know we have it
 it's only a question of weeks or a small amount of time
 so instead of saying that's a great thing
 we're going to save lives they're trying to disparage it they're trying to make it politics
 they're trying to do so
 and now what's going to happen is we'll have it and people won't want to take it
 that's really bad
 okay
 that's really bad
 but the biden-harris effort to spread anti-vaccine conspiracy theories only because they know we're close to putting it out getting it out and we're going to get it out fast
 the vaccine will be safe
 these are the greatest companies in the world to do this the greatest labs the greatest doctors it'll be effective and it'll be delivered before the end of the year
 and maybe as i said much sooner than that
 joe biden's plan to impose a blanket shutdown would collapse our economy and cause countless deaths from suicide drugs alcohol abuse heart disease and much more
 and that's what you're in right now
 you're in a shutdown
 it's crazy
 i've been to many states they're not in shutdowns and they're doing better
 they're doing better
 somebody's got to speak to this man dan
 maybe you got to talk to him dan
 go in a little early and say you don't know what the hell you're doing
 you don't know what you're doing
 they're hurting our people
 north carolina has to open up
 by contrast my administration is following the science protecting those at highest risk while allowing those at lower risk to safely return to work and to school go back to school go back to school
 you ever see the statistics on young people
 i don't know
 they have a great immune system
 let's get some of that immune system but they're amazing
 i mean thousands and thousands of people and they're not even affected very little meaning a small percentage of 1
 it's an incredible thing
 nobody knew that when it first came here nobody assumed a thing like that was possible
 but young people are very strong against this horrible disease
 through our historic china virus relief programs we've saved more than 1
3 million jobs for north carolina workers
 that worked out great
 we provided 380 million in relief for north carolina farmers and made 10 million in ppp loans to save- … and made 10 million in ppp loans to save your state's tobacco growers
 we saved your tobacco growers
 we have them very much in our sites
 we want to help them
 the biden agenda would crush this comeback and put our families in grave danger
 biden is promising to reimpose job-destroying regulations
 we got rid of more regulations he wants to put those regulations back plus 50
 you couldn't build a road
 we took roads from 18 19 and even 20 years approval down to two and we'll have it down to one
 you may get rejected for a highway or for a road but you're going to know in the period of 12 months to 24 months
 you're not going to spend an entire lifetime and then have them raise their hand
 i know all about it from the real estate business we brought it all the way down
 he wants to give illegal aliens government healthcare and taxpayer funded lawyers establish a national sanctuary city policy for illegal aliens with criminal records
 you wouldn't believe
 i mean this stuff is not even really believable but it is what it is
 he wants to surge refugee admissions by 700 into our country
 flooding your towns with poorly vetted migrants including many from jihadist regions of the world
 biden opposes school choice he opposes north carolina opportunity scholarships
 and he has stated that if he is elected charter schools are gone
 he said they're gone
 and they've been incredible
 in the second term i'll provide school choice to every parent in america
 and we'll also take good care of our teachers
 our teachers are very very important to me
 very important nothing more important
 a vote for republicans is a vote for safe communities great jobs and a limitless future for all americans
 and just in finishing i have to say that over the next four years we will make america into the manufacturing superpower of the world
 and we will end our reliance on china once and for all
 we'll make our medical supplies right here in the united states
 we will enact fair trade deals that create american jobs and grow american wages
 we are going to bring our companies back home where they should be
 i've been doing a lot of it but we are going to do it at a level that nobody ever thought possible
 we will rapidly return to full employment soaring wages and record prosperity
 we will hire more police increased penalties for assaults or law enforcement surge federal prosecutors into high crime communities and ban all sanctuary cities
 we will protect government benefits for american citizens not for illegal aliens
 what you're doing when you have all of these advantages when you're giving them free healthcare and free lawyers and free college and free everything they all come
 they didn't think of coming but they see this they talk and they talk to their friends and they all come in
 they want to come to america
 you're just bringing people in and we don't want to do that
 we want people to come to our country but they have to come in through merit and they have to come in legally very simple
 we will appoint prosecutors judges and justices who believe in enforcing the law not their own political agenda
 we will ensure equal justice for the citizens of every race color religion and creed
 we will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life
 we will uphold religious liberty free speech and the right to keep and bear arms
 we will strike down terrorists to threaten our citizens and we will keep america out of endless ridiculous foreign wars
 we'll build up our military like it's never been built up before
 we need our military for other reasons
 we will have the strongest we have now
 when i took over our military was depleted
 we have a lot of military people here
 our military was depleted our planes were 50 years old
 now you have brand new beautiful f35s we have brand new rockets and missiles
 and hopefully we never have to use them i will say that
 but the best way of not having to use them is to have them
 if you have them… we learned that in the school yards right
 we learned that in the school yards the best way is to have them
 we have the strongest military we've ever had by far
 we'll end surprise medical billing require price transparency which i've already signed into law which by the way kicks in on january 1st
 you better elect me north carolina
 i did price transparency and i've cut the price
 drugs are going to start going down at levels nobody's ever seen favored nations
 so we did price transparency kicks in january 1st
 could you imagine if this guy's president and your prices start to go way down hospitalization doctors you can choose your own doctor unlike with obama right
 price is going way down january 1st
 i said couldn't you start it sooner but statutorily that's when it had it start
 could you imagine if this guy's in and prices start dropping like a rock
 and they'll say what a great president he is
 he would have never done it
 and your drug prices prescription drug i'm instituting favorite nations laws
 so we're going to pay what other nations pay at the lowest
 and you'rr going to get back rebates that were given to middlemen who have to be the richest people in the world
 we'll protect medicare and social security and we will protect your social security
 and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions always
 america will land the first woman on the moon and the united states will be the first nation to land an astronaut on mars
 very exciting
 and i will reopen nasa
 that place was gone
 they had grass growing out of the runways you had to see it
 now it's the number one space center in the world by far
 you see what's going on
 we will restore patriotic education to our schools
 oh you know what i'm talking about
 look at you
 this is a very sophisticated group tom
 you know what i'm talking about patriotic education
 well the first thing they do is they want to take your history away
 that's a great group behind me
 i don't know
 they're activists
 but you know what
 you know what it means they want to take away your history
 that's why the monuments and the statutes they want to knock them down
 the first thing they do is take away your guts
 it's guts
 they take away your guts they take away your statues they take away your heroes
 they take away your great generals
 they take away your past
 and i said it was going to happen
 i said you know what
 they started off with generals and colonels and others that nobody ever heard of
 and i thought that was bad
 and then they went up a little bit and now i said someday it's going to be robert lee someday it's going to be washington someday it's going to be lincoln
 someday it's going to be jefferson someday it's going to be benjamin franklin
 it's all of them
 they take away your past
 they never taken away our past
 that's the way they do it
 you study it
 that's the way they go
 they take away your guts
 we'll teach our children to love our country honor our history and always respect our great american flag
 and we will live by the timeless words of our national motto in god we trust
 this is better than the arenas i have to say especially when you have a crowd like this
 but they're like this
 they have such spirit in this country
 people love our country so much
 i went to texas i went to ohio i went to florida it's always like this
 they love our country and we're not going to disappoint anybody
 we're not disappointed
 for years you had a president who apologized for america… so you had a president who apologized for america now you have a president who is standing up for america and standing up for the people of north carolina
 this is the most important election in the history of our country
 i wouldn't say that lightly
 and frankly i thought the last one was and i said it but they've gone to a level that nobody even thought possible
 these people have gotten stone cold crazy
 and you know what
 after we get in we're going to have tremendous success
 and it was building
 we were at a point we were so successful before the plague came in from china
 we were so successful that we were starting to get together
 people forget
 we were starting… success brings people together
 it was so good
 our jobs numbers were so good
 and whether it was the black community the hispanic community the asian community our jobs were so good our numbers were so good
 we were getting together and then the plague came in and we had to stop
 we had to close it up
 we had to open it and start all over again
 if you would have told me that we have one of the highest stock market some of the stock markets have already broken every record
 you look at nasdaq you look at some… we're far ahead of what i had planned
 we're far ahead of schedule
 but we did it once we have to do it again because this was an unforeseen event a terrible event a horrible event
 so many people died
 nobody should have died not one person
 so many people died but if we didn't do it right we would have lost millions of people
 just a terrible thing
 but oftentimes i say bring people together
 and then i realized if you look at that last few months we were starting to come together
 i was getting calls from you won't believe it democrats
 i was getting calls from democrats and they were saying wow things are going really well
 it was starting to happen and now we have to get it back to a level of great success because it'll happen again
 there'll be great unity eventually there'll be great unity
 so get your friends and get your family get your neighbors and your coworkers and vote
 and i say this because it's from charlotte to kitty hawk from durham to asheville and from wilmington to right here in winston-salem
 we inherit the legacy of north carolina patriots who gave their blood sweat and tears for this beloved nation
 we stand on the shoulders of american heroes who crossed the oceans blaze the trails settle the continent tame the wilderness dug out the panama canal laid down the railroads revolutionized industry one two world wars defeated fascism and communism and made america the single greatest nation in the history of the world
 and we are making it greater than ever before
 proud and great citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country
 we are returning power to you the american people
 with your help your devotion and your drive we are going to keep on working we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning winning winning
 we are one movement one people one family and one glorious nation under god
 and together with the incredible people of north carolina we will make america wealthy again we will make america strong again we will make america proud again we will make america safe again and we will make america great again
 thank you north carolina
 thank you
