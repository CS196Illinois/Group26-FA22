 thank you everybody
 thank you and vice president mike pence thank you very much
 incredible
 and hello to fayetteville
 hello fayetteville
 it's great to be here in north carolina's ninth congressional district with the hardworking patriots who believe in faith family god and country
 thank you
 thank you
 tomorrow you'll head to the polls to elect a congressman who always puts america first dan bishop
 i've just come from a meeting with north carolina officials representing communities hit by hurricane dorian and i expressed the unwavering solidarity of the american people we are behind you 100
 100
 the prayers of our entire nation are with the citizens of north carolina south carolina georgia florida and everyone else that was in the storms path and i will say i was called by the government of the bahamas and we're helping with the bahamas
 they were hit so hard
 they were hit so hard
 who would believe it
 we pledged the full support of the federal government through every step of the rebuilding process
 and i will say north carolina in our country probably got hit the hardest
 that was a little bit of a surprise but i know one thing about north carolina
 you can take it and you'll build it quickly and you'll build it beautifully
 and you'll be back sooner then anybody ever thought and it'll be better then ever
 right
 no doubt about it
 i also want to give a special recognition to the many non-governmental organizations doing so much to help people recover from dorian in particular franklin graham
 he's a wonderful guy
 he's got an organization samaritan's purse based right here in north carolina and the work that franklin and his family and all of those that are with franklin graham we want to thank them
 special great people
 great people
 thank you franklin
 thank you
 incredible job
 he does such a great job
 all over whenever there's a problem you see samaritan's purse and franklin and his people
 we love the people of this state and we will never ever leave your side
 north carolina will truly recover so fast
 i know you people so well
 let's not even talk about it
 let's not even talk about it
 we're here tonight to discuss the extraordinary progress we're making as a nation and how to ensure this amazing resurgence keeps on going and going strong
 in just over two years we've taken this big beautiful ship and it's being turned around very quickly
 nobody thought this would happen
 you know we won the greatest election certainly one of them but maybe the greatest but we won… let's say one of the greatest this way i won't be criticized
 they'll say you know george washington had a great election too
 the fake news right
 the fake news
 but we won one of the greatest elections in history and because of that and you would be in big trouble if we didn't i can tell you that
 you'd be… instead of going up we were heading in the wrong direction
 we have the number one economy anywhere in the world
 and every time i meet a foreign leader almost every time they say congratulations on what you've done with the economy
 i said i didn't do it
 i just set a certain path
 the people of the united states did it
 number one anywhere in the world
 and they tried to do the recession thing
 you know they tried the russia thing
 that didn't work
 they tried many other things
 i always say the media and their partner the democrats
 i wouldn't mind fighting the democrats but we really have to look at it as a two-some
 it's the media and the democrats
 it's one and the same
 we're rebuilding our military defending our sovereignty and reclaiming our dignity as a nation
 america is winning again and america is respected again
 they respect america
 by the way i have about 10 women in the front row and you come from north carolina and they travel all over the place
 hold up your hands
 these are great women
 i see them so much and i must say they have other things to do
 they look rich as hell to me i don't know
 how many is this
 how many rallies have you come too
 they can't count
 they said all of them except for two
 that's a lot of rallies and it all emanates from this area
 that's so great
 well at least you won't have to travel so far for this one right
 thank you very much for being here
 we really appreciate it
 well we appreciate it
 we appreciate it
 thank you
 really incredible people
 but you know we've created six million new jobs since election day and i couldn't say that in my initial rallies because nobody would have believed it
 six million new jobs
 more americans are working today than ever before in the history of our country
 almost 160 million americans nobody would have thought that was possible
 we wouldn't have been able to say it actually
 we've now had 13 straight months of wage gains of at least 3 so the people that work so hard… you remember i used to say during the rallies before we won people worked two jobs three jobs and they made less money then they made 21 years before and now wages are going up the economy is doing great and jobs have never been better
 so importantly more than 70 million americans have been lifted off of food stamps
 nearly 600000 americans entered the labor force last month alone
 think of that
 and the unemployment rate for african-americans just reached another brand new yesterday all time low in the history of our country
 how do you lose that debate
 remember i used to say why do you have to lose
 well now you have the best unemployment numbers employment and unemployment numbers that you've ever had as african-americans as asian-americans as hispanic-americans
 the best numbers we've ever had and by the way african-american youth unemployment has also reached the lowest level ever recorded in history
 and the labor force participation rate for women is at the highest level now in 15 years and soon will be 35 years and soon i promise will probably end up being better than ever
 i can tell you the unemployment numbers for women are the best they've been now in 72 years
 so i always say kiddingly i'm sorry i didn't make it historic but you know what
 it's going to be historic very soon
 it'll be historic very soon
 and here in north carolina over 230000 more people now have jobs and small business formation has skyrocketed by more than 25
 amazing
 but the radical democrats want to dismantle demolish and destroy everything that you've gained and they will do it and it won't take that long
 and that's why we need dan bishop and greg murphy
 we need them
 we need them going down
 we need them going down to congress and helping
 but they can do it
 it's also why we need four more years
 it has to… see it's like a plant
 we've changed things right
 keep america great
 we've changed things but it's gotta grow
 it's gotta develop those roots
 and once it does it's going to be very hard for them to destroy what we've done
 very hard
 and that's really why i consider this election… look we had a very very special day in 2016
 it was a very special day
 very special day
 it was an incredible day an incredible month an incredible year and i don't know that you can ever compare anything to it
 but i can say this 2020 is essentially just as important because they'll try and take it away
 whether it has to do with religion
 our evangelicals are here tonight and they're all over the place
 and what we've done for them and for religion is so important
 you know the other side i don't think they're big believers… they're not big believers in religion
 that i can tell you
 you listen to some of them
 they're trying and they're trying put out little statements
 they're not working too well
 little statements that are a little bit sort of not too good huh
 what is the word we want to use
 yeah a little… nah
 nah
 they're pushing a little hard and it's not working
 to stop the far left you must vote in tomorrow's special election
 so important
 or get your votes in early
 i think a lot of… who voted early for dan bishop
 good
 well that's good but the big thing is tomorrow
 tomorrow is the election and you'll get out
 to protect your family you must defeat open borders
 and you have democrat named dan mccready and he wants open borders
 he wants sanctuary cities
 he's not going to protect your second amendment
 he's doing nothing on your sec… you know north carolina's a very big second amendment state
 and dan bishop greg murphy these guys they're going to protect your second amendment
 but one of the biggest issues in this election is in fact sanctuary cities
 mccready supports sanctuary city policies that force prisons and jails to release criminal aliens directly into your neighborhoods
 get out
 go ahead
 go into the neighborhood
 go into… what's your neighborhood
 where do you… what
 rutherford county
 okay
 so how do you feel about having them released hardened horrible criminals into rutherford county
 i don't think so
 but your whole state… honestly… can i be honest
 it's crazy what's happening
 this whole thing with sanctuary cities and you go to california which is so many sanctuary cities they don't know what's happening out there
 you have people that want to get ride of those sanctuary cities they just aren't able to do it with the people that get elected
 a lot of illegal voting going on out there by the way a lot of illegal voting
 in august mccready said it was the right call to set illegal alien criminals loose in the great state… i'm using the words great state
 he doesn't
 … of north carolina
 with the support and encouragement of mccready sanctuary jurisdictions in north carolina have released thousands of dangerous criminal aliens into your communities and you see it
 you see it
 the charges against these freed criminals includes sexual assault robbery drug crimes kidnapping and homicide
 murder
 why would you do it
 why would you do it
 what is it
 explain it
 just recently mecklenburg county set free an illegal alien charged with first-degree rape and crimes against a child
 support for sanctuary cities is disloyalty to american citizens and mccready wants sanctuary cities with all of their protections for people that are serious criminals
 tomorrow is your chance to send a clear message to the america-hating left and it's gotta be
 and by the way we're building that wall and it's going up very big
 very big
 and you think it's easy to get money when you have the entire democrat party… and they control the house and we want to change that
 we want to flip the house
 we'll get so much
 it'll be amazing what we can do for our country
 we don't want dangerous criminal aliens roaming free in north carolina
 we want to take care of it
 this state should be a sanctuary for law abiding americans not for criminal aliens
 our great republican candidate dan bishop will fight with everything he has to stop sanctuary cities and defend the people of this great state
 dan come on up
 dan bishop everyone
 get out and vote
 come on up dan
 we need a doctor
 a doctor in the house please
 a doctor please

 thank you doctor
 thank you everybody
 thank you law enforcement
 thank you very much
 thank you
 thank you dan
 that was a good job

 he means it too
 he's great
 go out and vote tomorrow for dan bishop please
 so we've had great support over the last six months in particular from a man who happens to be your senator right now and we need him to keep going because he has been fantastic
 and i believe he's here tonight
 i just came in
 the weather wasn't so great to be traveling today and they said maybe we could skip north carolina today sir
 so i said no thank you
 i said no thank you
 can you imagine
 and by the way i have to say we have a big crowd in here right
 you haven't seen outside
 thousands and thousands of people who couldn't get in
 and when people wait two or three days to come in and especially these first rows i just want to tell you we really thank you
 incredible
 but thom tillis has really worked with us over the last period of time
 he's recently introduced a bill to give american victims the right to sue sanctuary cities
 that's a big deal
 and hold them accountable for the lives that they've shattered
 but to pass the bill we need more republicans
 tomorrow there is another crucial special election and we have a fantastic guy running in that one too republican greg murphy
 it looks like he's in good shape but you've got to get it out
 so i want to introduce thom tillis and i want to introduce greg murphy
 i want to thank you both
 thank you
 thank you thom and thank you greg
 so greg murphy is looking to like dan cut your taxes defend your second amendment support our policies really really support our military and our veterans
 we have rebuilt our military
 greg murphy come on up for a second here
 greg murphy
 come up
 come up greg
 come on up greg
 come on up greg
 just for a second
 then we'll get back to business
 we've got to do this and i don't know
 he's been a great champ thank you greg
 come
 please
 good luck tomorrow greg
 get out there and vote for those two guys
 they're terrific
 we're thrilled to be joined tonight by many more terrific republican leaders
 a man who's really been stepping up to the front
 he defended justice kavanaugh when he was treated so badly
 i've never seen anything like the treatment that justice kavanaugh received
 and everybody respects him and everybody likes him
 and i like him and we used to fight like hell right
 but we don't fight anymore
 we like each other a lot and he's a special man
 and he's become a special friend
 senator lindsay graham
 another man who is a fighter… i guess we're all fighters
 you have to be a fighter or you're not going to be here very long
 i can tell you that
 we've got to fight them more than anybody else
 but a man who's done an incredible job in washington took over a rough situation and he's become a real leader and that's republican leader kevin mccarthy
 kevin
 kevin's working so hard for so many different people
 he wants to see dan and greg win so badly
 thank you for being here
 appreciate it leader
 representative david rouzer
 david thank you
 david rouzer
 he's done a fantastic job
 our lieutenant governor who is going to be i think a highly competitive candidate for a very important race dan forest
 thank you dan
 thank you very much dan
 we also have north carolina republican party chair michael whatley
 what a job you've done
 and we have a man from north carolina who loves this state
 he fights so hard
 he doesn't know what it is not to fight
 you know who i'm talking about
 they got it mark
 you're all screaming mark meadows
 that's right
 he's great
 so many
 jim jordan andy biggs gaetz and… i just got so… by the way devin nunez
 devin nunez
 how about devin
 he was out there when it wasn't in vogue to be saying that comey was a stone cold liar and leaker
 but he knew it all the time devin nunez
 but mark meadows is pretty incredible and do they love… … but mark meadows has been incredible and do they love him in your state
 do they love mark meadows
 thank you mark
 also a friend of mine who's been with us from the beginning he's not a politician but he might as well be one
 he loves us
 he loves this party and he loves your state lives here louis dejoy
 one of the most successful people
 thank you louis and your wife is… doing a great job louis
 and a very special thanks to my son don junior and kimberly
 great job
 did don junior give a good speech
 i heard that
 they all said he was on fire
 well he's fighting
 he loves this country
 my son loves this country
 my family loves this country and two people from your state that the first lady before she was first lady she said you know there are two people that are unbelievable
 you've got to watch them
 i said i'm not interested
 i'm too busy
 no no no
 you have to watch them
 they're so great they're so smart
 they love the country they love you
 diamond and silk
 they are incredible
 incredible people
 thank you very much
 thank you what a job and they're doing very well i have to tell you that
 our shared republican agenda is pro-worker pro-jobs pro-family pro-growth and 100 pro-american
 and by the way so is doug collins and so john ratcliffe
 thank you fellows
 thank you
 two incredible fighters also
 for decades our leaders put global interest and special interest ahead of your interest
 you know that better than anybody and this state knows it better than anybody
 they traded away your factories sold your future squandered your tax dollars sacrificed your security and bogged us down in one foreign debacle after another
 but all of that is changed
 we're respected again
 they're all saying oh gee
 i hope he doesn't do this or that
 they've taken advantage of us for years and i have to say sadly in many cases it's our allies that took the greatest advantage of this country
 but now you finally have a president who understands that i'm not supposed to be the president of the world i'm supposed to be the president of the united states of america
 to bring back our jobs for other countries we passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in american history
 we've cut a record number of job killing regulations
 no president no longer how long they serve has gotten anywhere even close to what we've done with regulations and that's one of the reasons our economy is so good
 and we have tremendous potential upward and china wants to talk
 they want to talk
 china's lost three million jobs thousands of companies are leaving china the supply chain is crumbling because they can't pay the tariffs and our country has taken over things that you would've never thought
 as an example hundreds of billions of dollars have been and are coming into our country in the form of tariffs and china is eating the cost which the fake news doesn't want to tell you
 and out of the tens of billions of dollars that we've taken in because of the fact that our great american patriot farmers have been targeted by china they've been targeted because they know the farmer is like trump
 i love the farmers
 so they targeted the farmers and i said to sonny perdue secretary of agriculture sonny how much was it last year and the year before
 tell me
 it was 12 billion and it was 16 billion and out of the tariffs that we've taken in we gave to our farmers for distribution hopefully very good distribution hopefully very even distribution we've given them 28 billion so that they're whole
 so that they're whole
 nobody would ever do that
 nobody would ever do that i can tell you that right now and our farmers know we have to fight
 i see it all the time where some of the networks that are crazy they have a group of farmers in some cases they have groups of women they say what do you think of president trump
 we like him a lot
 we're with him all the way
 and they want to turn off the cameras
 they go crazy but with the farmers you know that
 you ever see that
 the 10 women
 what do you think of president trump
 we love him
 boy would i like to put you on television i'll tell you right now and they can't turn off those cameras fast enough but they say to the farmers you voted for president trump are you happy
 and ever one of them said he did things that no ones ever done before
 who would think of getting 12 billion plus 16 million 28 billion because they've been targeted
 that's the amount i asked sonny i said sonny what's the amount they've took our of our farmers
 it was 16 billion and the year before 12
 and said sonny we got to make that up and we made that up
 who would do that
 nobody would do that
 first of all nobody else ever had tens of billions of dollars pouring in from china because it's always been the other way around
 china has taken advantage of our country for decades decades
 and i guarantee you one thing none of these democrats whether it's pocahontas or sleepy joe none of them would be able to do a thing about it and nobody would ever think of helping the farmers who have been targeted by china
 china made 500 billion over the last number of years on a yearly basis they steal our intellectual property
 so many other things
 so now it's just different and now it's working the other way and tariffs are a beautiful thing when you know how to use them they're a beautiful thing
 and i want china to do well and i hope they do well but they've had now the worst year in 57 years
 i wonder why
 i wonder why
 and hopefully it'll all work out
 we'll see
 we're going to be talking next week
 we're talking now
 they're going to be coming to the united states in two or three weeks and we'll see what happens but unless we're going to make a good deal or a fair deal for our country let's face it we can not go back to a situation
 we're giving hundreds of billions of dollars to china becomes standard fare
 not going to happen we can't do it and we have many other countries also but we'll worry about them a little bit later
 plenty of others they've taken advantage of our country like you wouldn't believe and i've been saying this for many years
 i was saying this when i was a private citizen
 they take our jobs they make our product they sell the product into our country with no tax no nothing
 so we end up with closed factories no jobs no taxes no nothing and these other countries gain
 as an example mexico i must say they've really helped us at the border
 the democrats will not doing anything about these horrible open loopholes which would be so good
 so we're doing it a different way and mexico is now patrolling with 27000 troops
 they've never had two troops steward our border and you saw the numbers today were down approximately 57
 but our country could fix it so easy if the democrats would sit with me for 15 minutes but they don't want to do that because they want to have open borders
 they want to have drugs pouring into our country
 you have to have a wall and you have to stop it and when you look at what's happening with human trafficking and it's mostly women they traffic in women and they pour through our borders
 well every inch of wall that we put up is vital and we're putting up miles and miles and we intend by next year at the end of the year to have anywhere between 400 and 500 miles of wall built and this is serious wall
 this is the real deal
 serious wall
 and i want to thank our new secretary of defense mark esper for the job he's done and he views it really as a national security threat and you have to
 what can be much more threatening that people that want to pour across our borders and we have the worst walls we have the weakest walls in the history of any country
 you can't do anything to stop them
 you have program catch and release
 you catch them and then you have to release them and they're suppose to come back to court in the next three four fix six years and nobody shows up and democrats don't want to fix it
 so we're stopping them so we don't even have to worry about court
 we ended the last administrations cruel war on american energy
 the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world
 and for all of these crazy people but they're not so crazy they know what they're doing that talk about russia russia russia
 russia's not too happy about that
 their primary source of income is oil and gas and now we're bigger than russia bigger than saudi arabia
 we're bigger than everybody and we're doing great
 so they're not exactly happy
 the russian hoax was a pure hoax you saw that with comey the other day
 yet every leading democrat running for president pledges to ban the energy that drives our economy and wage an under… if you look at what's going on your way of life is under assault by these people
 i mean i go out and sometimes i'll get these huge audiences and i wish we could've gotten a large arena than this
 we tried
 i was even willing to stand out in the rain and get my hair soaking wet but they said it was a little bit out of your district and i said i don't know if it looks good being out of your district
 but i was willing to do it i would've taken it
 i would have been very proud to have done it
 it would've shown it's my real hair at least
 it wouldn't be pretty but it's my hair
 may not be great but i will say it's better than most of my friends who are the same age
 a lot better
 a lot
 but we had a different location as you all know and we said let's do this one
 it's bigger
 and we put screens outside for all of the people
 we have screens and loud speakers and everything
 it's really amazing what's going on out there but after years of building up there countries we are finally building up our country that's the bottom line
 the last administration with biden and obama at the helm they tried to ram through one of the worst trade deals that ever been negotiated the transpacific partnership
 you could've kissed many of your industries goodbye
 tpp would've gutted the american auto industry
 it would've been even worse than nafta and we know how bad nafta was
 all you have to do is even to this day look around at all those empty plants where people moved down and companies moved down to mexico
 not under the usmca
 we got to get nancy pelosi to put it in for a vote make it bipartisan
 she'll have tremendous democrat support
 the farmers want it the unions want it the manufacturers want it and by the way 600000 manufacturing jobs in this country remember
 you would need a magic wand
 you can't do that anymore
 well we did it but we've got to get usmca put up for a vote by the democrats
 but in my first week in office i proudly withdrew from that job destroying tpp catastrophe and we're replacing one of the worst trade deals ever made by any country
 you can go back as far as you want nafta the disaster of nafta
 so whatever you do start talking to your people we need a vote on the usmca
 that's united states mexico and canada and they've already voted
 they want it and we want it and it's great for the farmers
 it's great for everybody
 we're also aggressively combating a problem that you have in north carolina problem that we have in almost all states the opioid epidemic
 last year we saw the first nationwide decline in drug overdose deaths in nearly 31 years
 at the center of the american drug crisis is the border crisis
 criminal cartel smuggle vast quantities of lethal narcotics across our souther border including heroin meth cocaine and fentanyl
 100000 people a year die from what comes across our souther border and we can get the democrats to help us in sealing it even tighter
 we got to get them
 we got to get them
 we got to get them
 so if you want to stop the drug smugglers the human traffickers the viscous ms13 gang members and by the way thank you to ice
 these people go into those nests we call them nets
 these are vicious vicious people
 we got into the nests with our ice people and for them it's another day at the office
 there aren't too many people in this room that want to do it for a living
 let me see
 that guy would
 maybe him maybe her right
 maybe her
 but it's a rough job and they get so little praise for the job that they do
 so dangerous
 these are many killers in those gangs and we're taking them out of our country by the thousands ms13
 and as you know democrats even want to give free healthcare to illegal immigrants
 as long as i'm your president i will never ever let democrats take away your healthcare and give it away free to people that have entered our country illegally
 we can't do that
 it's a tremendous incentive to come in
 democrats also want to bring in unlimited numbers of foreign refugees from overseas all at the expense of supporting their own communities
 republicans no matter what you do where you are we want people to obey our laws
 you want people that are going to help our country
 the democrat party has never been farther outside of the mainstream
 every major democrat running for president supports a massive government takeover of healthcare that would raid medicare force private doctors out of medicine and lead to the rationing of life saving treatments
 and they want to take away your private healthcare your private insurance
 180 million people will lose with what they want to do
 it's a disaster
 it's like did you ever really feel where you don't even have to treat people nicely
 you don't have any choice you have to vote for me
 i can leave right now
 i can say north carolina i've had it with you
 i'm leaving right now
 and you know what
 you got to go out and vote
 what are you going to do
 put one of these crazy people running our country again
 but it's never been so far left
 i told a story the other day about a business man i saw one of the biggest in the country
 you probably know his name
 he's hated me for 20 years and i've hated him also
 okay
 now they're going to go out tomorrow breaking news donald trump hates people
 you're sort of right about that
 i never liked this guy and i see him in the white house and i say what are you doing here
 and he goes mr
 president
 see now he calls me mr
 president
 he used to call me something else
 mr
 president i'm fighting for your victory
 i said you got to be kidding
 he goes honestly you're doing a great job but also if this radical left gets in they're going to take away everything and they're going to destroy our country
 and for the first time i like this guy
 my administration is defending your right to choose the plan and the doctor that is best for you
 remember president obama
 28 times remember 28 times they counted them and there's much more than that i would imagine that you can choose your plan you can choose your doctor
 it didn't work out that way did it
 obamacare and we're keeping obamacare alive
 we got rid of the individual mandate the worst part of obamacare
 we're keeping it and running it as well as it can but the premiums are too high
 the deductibles are through the roof
 it's ridiculous and we're coming up with lindsey graham and all of the folks we're coming up with a great healthcare plan that if we take back to the house
 that's why dan and greg if we take back the house if we keep the senate and maybe even increase it a little bit wouldn't be bad and on the assumption we keep the presidency you're going to have great healthcare
 thank you
 we almost had it
 we had a man campaigning for eight years to knock out obamacare and when he voted it didn't work out that way did it
 we had it and we would have had it but we're going to end up actually with a better plan
 sometimes through adversity things work out better
 we're going to end up with a better plan you watch
 we'll always protect patients with pre-existing conditions also
 always yep my word
 our ambitious campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs has produced the largest decline in drug prices in more than 51 years
 virtually every top democrat also now supports late term abortion
 ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up to the moment of birth and if you look at the governor of virginia he was even talking about essentially you would say an execution
 he was talking after the baby is born the doctor will talk to the mother and they'll make the decision as to whether or not that baby lives
 this is a radical democrat idea
 that's why i've asked congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from god
 democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion and socialism
 they're socialists
 the republican party is the party of the american worker the american family and the american dream
 every day they're making good on the motto promise made promises kept
 in fact we are keeping even more promises by far than we made or than we promised
 so many more
 so many more
 so many more
 you know what we did with respect to people that are very sick or terminally ill right
 right to try it's called
 i love that name
 right to try
 we have some of the greatest doctors in the world labs in the world hospitals in the world and we have incredible medicine that's prohibited from being used until it gets approval and sometimes that approval can take many years
 and i said wait a minute if a person is sick…  and they've been trying to get this for 45 years
 i said if a person is sick and maybe terminally ill why aren't we letting them try this new technology
 and so many things are happening and we did right to try
 and it wasn't easy but i was helped by lindsey and a lot of great people
 a lot of great people
 all of them helped
 mark helped so much
 all of them help

 we have had a tremendous success
 we had so many people wanting to help but it was complicated believe it not because the country didn't want the liability
 i said you know what you do
 you draw up an agreement taking away liability
 they said that's a good idea
 the insurance companies and the drug companies were very unsure
 this has been going on for many years
 i got it done
 the results have been unbelievable
 right to try
 things that we've never even talked about we're getting done
 maybe one of the biggest things is within about a month we'll have close to 180 federal judges including the public division judges
 including two great new supreme court justices
 justice neil gorsuch and justice brett cavanaugh who they put through hell
 we passed something that they've wanted to do for half a century
 we passed va choice
 so when your great and honored veterans are waiting in line for three weeks four weeks five days 10 days two months they go to a private doctor we pay for the bill and they get themselves taken care of instead of dying which was happening
 and we also passed va accountability on behalf of our great veterans
 that means when they treat our veterans and they wouldn't have done it in primetime i can tell you but when they treat our sick and trouble veterans badly we can say you're fired
 get the heck out
 it's called va accountability
 that's another one we've been trying and in all fairness the unions made it very tough
 civil service made it almost impossible
 everyone said you're never going to get it done
 we got it done
 we want to thank the republican senate
 i want to thank some incredible people in the house of representatives and kevin i want to thank you… … people in the house of representatives
 and kevin i want to thank you because that was a great job you did on that one
 that was a great job thank you kevin mccarthy
 we've received record funding for the us military 700 billion last year 716 billion dollars this year 738 billion dollars … and you know know i'm a big believer in budgets but we have no choice
 we had to rebuild our military with all that's going on today with china with russia with radical islam with everything that's happening we had to do something
 and you know budgets are fine i love budgets and we will get to that don't worry about it
 but we had to rebuild our military was totally depleted it was totally depleted
 we have beautiful new f-35's f-18's new ships new missiles new rockets we have new everything
 i came back with admiral brown the united states coast guard and some of the other folks and they were saying that the new coast guard cutters … how good a job has the coast guard done during these hurricanes
 and i said admiral how good are the new coast guard cutters
 he said they're the finest in the world sir
 and they had old broken equipment that they had to keep going on a shoestring
 they have brand new coast guard cutters
 we had to do it we had to do it
 there's always time for the other but we had to do it
 we've rebuilt our military we've taken care of the great people that work in our military
 we gave them a raise a beautiful raise they were so entitled to
 and i also got other nato members to pay an additional 100 billion dollars over the last year and a half that they weren't paying they were delinquent
 we're supposed to protect them and they don't pay i say you can't do that
 you can't do that you got to pay nato
 now we're finally making immensely wealthy countries pay the cost of their defense we're negotiating with a lot of them
 think of it we have these immensely wealthy countries and they're paying for a fraction of our cost to defend them
 how did that happen
 and do you know what the biggest excuse is when i go to them and i'll say king you got to pay or mr
 prime minister you got to pay or mr
 president you've got to pay you know
 it's costing us billions of dollars to protect these wealthy
 you know what their biggest thing is
 because i can't understand how we did this for so many years decades decades … you have been defending all of … i won't mention names because i don't want to embarrass anybody
 i don't want to forget it some of the wealthiest countries in the world
 and when i say king president prime minister queen no matter what i say you know what they say
 but nobody's ever asked us to do that before that's the only excuse
 because i say to them why would we do this
 why are we defending you
 you're immensely wealthy you compete with us on trade
 we have lousy trade deals that we are renegotiating many of them and ultimately all of them
 why are we protecting you mr
 president
 well i don't know i don't know
 but you know what their answer is
 because you've always done it
 that's not a great answer
 so we're taking in billions and billions but i've got 100 billion dollars and the secretary general of nato stoltenberg is my biggest fan
 he said until president trump you had to see the data across the spending was going like this
 and ours was going like this we were defending many countries that treat us very badly on trade and very unfairly
 we were defending them and now it's changing around 100 billion dollars they're not happy
 and then i read where obama is more popular in germany than trump
 he's got to be i'm making people pay their bills he's got to be
 you know the day that i'm more popular than him i'm not doing my job
 the big story they like him more in europe than they like trump
 i think they should
 100 billion dollars more they're paying
 to protect america's security i withdrew the united states from the horrible one-sided iran nuclear deal
 we paid them 150 billion dollars for that piece of work
 i withdrew it and we put sanctions all over the place and they're a much different country and let's see what happens
 but i can tell you they'd like to get back to business because they're not doing very well
 when i came into office iran was a real terror
 18 sites of confliction they were behind every one of them in the middle east
 and who knows could have been elsewhere
 and i said we're not going to do it 150 billion dollars president obama paid and 1
8 billion in cash
 whoever saw a million dollars piled up as a promotion
 in hundred dollar bills it's a lot
 now take a million dollars and make it 1
8 billion dollars in cash
 i'm actually more impressed with that number than 150 billion dollars you want to know the truth
 1
8 billion dollars in cash and we got taken to the cleaners so i terminated the deal
 and i recognized israel's true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem which every president said they would do
 and i also approved for israel the golan heights and if you really think about it i said to people what's more important the golan heights or the capital of jerusalem by moving our embassy there
 he said neither sir
 what you've done in iran is more important than both of them
 i said you know i guess you're right when you think about it
 so we've done a good job all of us together as a movement we've done a great job for israel
 for years you watched as your politicians apologized for america
 now you have a president who is standing up for america and we are standing up for the people of north carolina
 you must never forget that the 2020 election is about one thing thing you
 it's true it's not about me it's about you
 it's about your family your future and the fate of your country
 that's what we did in 2016 they came from the hills and valleys they came from the cities they came from all over the place and people were saying these fakers back there they were saying what the hell is happening
 but i knew it was going to happen because we go out and we see these rallies the likes of which no one has ever seen before ever ever ever in politics ever in politics
 a vote for any democrat in 2020 and a vote for any democrat tomorrow in north carolina is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and a destruction of the american dream
 we are entering this campaign with the best record the best results the best agenda and the only positive vision for the people of north carolina
 and i've said it and i say it loudly and proudly i don't believe there's been any president or any administration that has done more in 2
5 years then we have as a group in america
 when you add it all up nobody's done what we have
 our first task is a giant victory
 tomorrow right here in the great state of north carolina with your support tomorrow we take the first steps to firing speaker pelosi and winning back the house in 2020
 we need everybody to get your friends get your family get your neighbors and get out and vote for dan bishop and get out and vote for greg murphy you got to get out tomorrow and vote
 together we will lift millions more from our horrible horrible situations that have developed over the years
 look at what's happening to democrat-run cities every single one of them
 we are going to lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity
 with your help we will elect for republicans to congress to create a safe modern fair and lawful system of immigration
 we will enact great deals that result in more products probably stamped with the four beautiful words made in the usa made in the usa
 you want made in america i don't care what do you like better
 made in america or made in the usa
 go ahead
 wait ready
 you want made in america then made in the usa
 what do you like better made in america made in the usa
 okay i think we know that answer
 so in 2016 we had in my opinion the greatest phrase in the history of politics make america great again
 now we are within moments hopefully of having despite what you heard a few weeks ago where we were heading
 and they're going please please let there be a recession please
 they're willing to give up their results because they think it will help them win the election
 they're not going to win the election
 don't forget we are doing this and still fighting the unfairness of china and other countries on trade
 what happens when that gets fixed and other things get fixed
 we're setting new records and we're fighting trade deals and we're fighting military deals that are unfair to our country
 think what happens when it all gets fixed we have ourselves a country that's going to be so strong
 but we had a phrase make what
 make america great again the best
 i think it was maybe the greatest 2016 but we've done a lot and now they're very close to setting a new … i think it's the 118th time that we will have set a new record with the stock market right
 many many times many many times
 i can't be certain that many but it's a lot okay
 i always have to preface it because there'll be headlines trump didn't tell the truth
 so i've always got to be extremely cautious
 we had the greatest phrase of all time and even the fake news media would agree make america great again maga country make america great again
 now we still have a year and a half little bit less can you believe it
 can you believe it
 i stood in the white house with the first lady that first night and i said wow look at this
 that's the bedroom of abraham lincoln you have to see this
 it's so perfectly done it's so the way it was
 we announced it in front of the press and in 2026
 and i said well wait a minute under the normal rules i will be out in 2024 so we may have to go for an extra term
 oh they're going crazy
 tomorrow you will see headlines trump wants an extra term i told you i told you
 he wants an extra term ladies and gentlemen
 we told you we told you he's a dictator we told you
 no no i'm only kidding i'm only kidding
 but we actually have the world cup it's the biggest sporting event in the world and we got it
 and that's where we're working it also with mexico and canada to give them some of the games
 we've got a great relationship with the world cup it's a big deal
 bob kraft helped me with the new england patriots people
 tom brady had a pretty good game the other night right
 they have a good a coach whether you like it or not and i know you north carolina
 but how good a coach in all fairness here is coach belichick
 how good is he
 i know you want to be cool but he's pretty good
 we have to appreciate genius we all like genius
 but we are going to achieve new breakthroughs in science medicine finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending within 10 years the aids epidemic in america
 that's shocking to hear that but we can do it we're going to do it definitely
 incredible the strides that we have made
 we will defeat the democrats to drive up the cost of houses cars healthcare and education by liberating americans from their analysts' push for a job killing soul crushing washington regulations
 as an example we're trying to get the car companies going to give them a little bit of extra energy and they will be able to build a car that consumers can buy which will be better than the car they make today
 and you'll save 3500 dollars think of that
 it will be safer it will be better you can save 3500 dollars it will be less costly
 and we're going to try to get that done
 and then they were forcing you to buy light bulbs that cost a fortune so i signed something a couple days ago that gives you the right to continue to use the incandescent light bulbs i don't know about you much less expensive lights that are beaming down over us
 but you know somebody told me that as you know they're much more expensive bulbs than for what you save
 but they said that if the bulb break it's considered almost like the waste site
 it's very big the bulbs the new bulbs they're very dangerous with all of the gases
 and i said what's the point
 well then he said well i'm saying if we continue that production they can buy whatever they want to buy but it can really save a tremendous amount of money and even have a light that's better
 and there is a big danger in fact they have labels don't break this bulb
 what do you do you're going to throw it away
 i promise i won't break it all the new ones
 so you can hopefully buy the new ones but you can buy the old ones too and you can save a lot of money and you could even look better
 we will defend privacy free speech free assembly religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms
 above all we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one america we'll be one united nation
 we'll support protect and defend the constitution of the united states
 we stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement thank you law enforcement
 we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life
 we believe that faith and family not government and bureaucracy are the true american way like you
 we believe that children should be taught to love our country honor our history and to always respect our great american flag
 and we will live by the words of our national motto in god we trust it'll stay there
 we stand on the shoulders of american patriots who crossed the ocean settled the continent tamed the wilderness revolutionized industry pioneered science won two world wars wars defeated fascism and communism put a man on the moon and built the most exceptional country in the history of the world
 we are great americans and the future belongs to us
 the future belongs to you
 with your help your devotion and your drive we are going to keep on working we are going to keep on fighting and i'd like to fight a little less with these people but they just don't stop
 they just keep coming at you in waves
 they are unfortunately not the best people
 and we are going to keep on winning winning winning we're going to keep on winning
 we are one movement one people one family and one glorious nation under god
 america is thriving like never before we may have right now the greatest economy in the history of our nation
 and ladies and gentlemen of north carolina the best is yet to come
 together we will make america wealthy again
 we will make america strong again we will
 we will make america safe again
 and we will make america great again
 thank you everybody
 thank you north carolina
 thank you
