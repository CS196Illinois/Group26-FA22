trump,Thank you
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you to Vice President Pence
trump, He's a good guy
trump, We've done a great job together
trump, And Merry Christmas, Michigan
trump, Thank you, Michigan
trump, What a victory we had in Michigan
trump, What a victory was that
trump, One of the greats
trump, Was that the greatest evening But I'm thrilled to be here with thousands of hardworking patriots as we celebrate the miracle of Christmas, the greatness of America and the glory of God
trump, Thank you very much
trump, And did you notice that everybody is saying Merry Christmas again Did you notice Saying Merry Christmas
trump, I remember when I first started this beautiful trip, this beautiful journey, I just said to the First Lady, You are so lucky
trump, I took you on this fantastic journey
trump, It's so much fun
trump, They want to impeach you
trump, They want to do worse than that
trump, By the way, by the way, by the way, it doesn't really feel like we're being impeached
trump, The country is doing better than ever before
trump, We did nothing wrong
trump, We did nothing wrong
trump, And we have tremendous support in the Republican Party like we've never had before
trump, Nobody's ever had this kind of support
trump, But this sacred season, our country is thriving and it's thriving truly like it has never, it has never happened before to the extent what's happening now
trump, And by the way, your state, because of us, not because of local government, but because of us, because of the job that we've done
trump, Because I understand she's not fixing those potholes
trump, That's what the word is
trump, It was all about roads and they want to raise those gasoline taxes on you
trump, We don't want to do that
trump, But she's not fixing the potholes
trump, But Michigan's had the best year it's ever had
trump, Best year it's ever had
trump, And that's because we have auto companies expanding and thriving and they're coming in from Japan and they're coming in from a lot of other places
trump, Look what's happening
trump, And you know, I don't know if you know this, but probably 10 years ago I was honored
trump, I was the Man Of The Year by I think somebody, whoever
trump, I was the Man Of The Year in Michigan
trump, Can you believe it Long time
trump, And that was long before I ever decided to do this
trump, I was happy
trump, I had a beautiful life
trump, What the hell did I do this for But look how we're doing
trump, Do we love it I love it
trump, But anyway, I was the Man Of The Year and probably close to 10 years ago and I came to Michigan
trump, He said, You're still the Man Of The Year
trump, Thank you
trump, Who said that Thank you
trump, So I came in and I remember the speech so well
trump, I said, Why are you allowing them to steal your car companies Why are you allowing them to go to Mexico and to go from China where they come in from China, they build them in China, they sell them into our country with no tax and you lose your jobs, you lose your factories, the companies leave and you get nothing
trump, Why are they lying I asked that a long time ago and we stopped it
trump, We've stopped it
trump, And you see that
trump, And we just made the USMCA
trump, We're getting rid of NAFTA, which I think is the worst trade deal ever
trump, And it's very exciting
trump, It's a great deal
trump, It's a great deal
trump, It's going to stop exactly what we were just talking about
trump, It makes it very, very prohibitive
trump, They can do it, but they've got to pay a hell of a big price to do it
trump, And history has proven that stops them
trump, But we have a great USMCA that we negotiated with Mexico, with Canada
trump, Now, from the standpoint of the farmers, you know what's going on
trump, We had tremendous trade barriers in Canada
trump, We had attacks on dairy products, 297 tariff, nobody talked about it, with Canada
trump, And we had some really bad things with Mexico
trump, We now have a wonderful deal
trump, And if we didn't have a good deal, you know what I would have done what What I would have put tariffs on both countries and that would have been it, right That would have been it
trump, Unfortunately the deal's been sitting with Nancy Pelosi for a long time and what happened And she had a lot of pressure, especially from manufacturing areas, farm areas, a lot of pressure to sign it
trump, So here's what happens
trump, So I get along with labor
trump, I had a lot of union labor vote for me, tremendous amount of labor
trump, In New York where I come from, we have a lot of unions
trump, And that's okay
trump, That's fine
trump, So we left a little stuff for the union because we figured to get it signed, we'll give a little bit and we did it and we have one great deal
trump, And now you have the Democrats trying to take credit for this deal and that's okay
trump, Whatever it takes
trump, For seven months, it sits
trump, They don't do anything
trump, We give
trump, And by the way, I spoke to the unions the day before I say, Fellows, you got to get it done
trump, And union labor loves me and I love you too sir
trump, I love you too sir
trump, So we have a great deal with Mexico, with Canada
trump, And it is true
trump, I say it out loud because I say it to them right now
trump, If they ever wanted to break the deal, that's okay
trump, If somebody wants to break a deal with me, you always have to have an alternative, right And this country, the deals we made, we did a deal with South Korea
trump, That's great
trump, We did a deal with Japan, 40 billion dollar deal with Japan
trump, It was just a little piece of a deal
trump, Okay That was a piece of a deal
trump, And I said to Japan, Look, you got to make this deal or we're going to put a 20 tariff on the cars
trump, And that's more money than anything we're talking about
trump, That's all right
trump, That's all right
trump, That's all right
trump, Get her out
trump, Ger her out of here
trump, Oh well
trump, You're about to hear the greatest speech you've ever heard
trump, And that's going to be the publicity because all the fake news back there will say massive riot… Massive riots
trump, Fake news
trump, But seriously, look, look, look, they won't say it
trump, They won't say it, because when we have protesters all in favor, they don't talk about it, but there's a slob
trump, There's a real slob
trump, Wait, wait a minute
trump, She'll get hell when she gets back home with mom
trump, But she made… Look, she screams a little bit
trump, And you know what I like to do Avoid them
trump, Because I'll tell you the big problem
trump, I could hardly hear her
trump, What happens is all of you people go crazy
trump, Look, look, look, and the place
trump, Okay, so there's one disgusting person who made… Wait, wait, who made a… I wouldn't say this, but made a horrible gesture with the wrong finger right Now they won't say that, the fake news, they won't say it
trump, If one of us did that, it would be like the biggest story ever
trump, I think it's terrible
trump, And I'll tell you the other thing, I don't know who the security company is, but the police came up, but they want to be so politically correct so they don't grab her wrist lightly and get her out
trump, They say, Oh, would you please come Would you please come with me Sure
trump, Ma'am, would you And then she gives the guy the finger and he, Oh, Oh
trump, You got to get a little bit stronger than that, folks
trump, And they… 
trump, Making another group of tariffs, seven and a half percent
trump, This gives us a lot of currency to do the phase two deal, which they want to start, but we're taking in billions of dollars and to help the farmers who were targeted, 16 billion and 12 billion the previous year, helps the farmers
trump, So you know what we do, out of that big check that we get, all that money flows into the treasury
trump, Out of the big check, we gave the farmers 16 billion dollars and 12 billion for the previous year
trump, And you know, the incredible thing, and I was with a lot of farmers
trump, I was with a group of 36 farmers at the White House
trump, You know what they said to me I said, Don't worry about it
trump, We're going to take care of you guys
trump, And I used a bad word
trump, You know what word I used We're going to get you a subsidy
trump, And they said this two years ago, I said, How much were you targeted for This was the first year
trump, 12 billion, sir
trump, The second year was 16
trump, They were target
trump, That's what they didn't get from China
trump, So I said, It's all right, we're going to give you a subsidy of the same and we're going to take it out of the tariffs and we're going to have billions and billions of dollars left over
trump, And they said, Sir, we don't want money
trump, We just want a level playing field
trump, I've never seen that before
trump, I've never seen that before
trump, So we will have invested in our military, since I'm here, which is less than three years
trump, Our military, by the way, in all due respect to the previous two administrations, our military was depleted
trump, It was depleted
trump, It was in bad shape
trump, We had fighter jets that were 35 years old
trump, We had planes that were 60 years… You heard where the father flew them, the grandfather flew them, and now the young son comes in
trump, We've got the best equipment in the world now
trump, Spent two and a half trillion dollars, made in the USA
trump, Two and a half trillion
trump, We will shortly
trump, That'll be all finished
trump, We're going to have the greatest… Now we have the best planes
trump, We're going to have the best ships
trump, We're building a lot of ships now
trump, We're building the most powerful weapons in the world
trump, Now, we don't want to even talk about it
trump, We never want to use them
trump, But you know, the way we're not going to have to use them is if we have them
trump, We're building submarines, the power of which nobody's ever seen before
trump, Nobody's ever seen before
trump, It's funny, we have these companies come in
trump, I like to make good deals
trump, You like to make good deals
trump, That's what we do, right So these really countries that come in, prime ministers, presidents, sometimes dictators, those we can't deal with too much
trump, Sir, we'd like to buy a nuclear submarine
trump, I say, No thanks
trump, I turn them all down
trump, You have no idea how many people… But we're building some of the… They're the most powerful weapons ever made by man or womankind
trump, I say mankind and womankind
trump, They can definitely fight
trump, They're the real deal
trump, These guys, so good looking
trump, I said, You could be a movie star
trump, Go to Hollywood
trump, No sir
trump, I like doing what I'm doing
trump, So I said to these guys, you going to see, just like central casting, I said, I said, Fellas, how good is this plane They said, Sir, it's great
trump, Why Because the enemy can't see it
trump, That helps
trump, Stealth
trump, It's actually called super stealth
trump, So I said, You mean they can't see, so you shoot at them but they can't… He said, They have no idea where we are, sir
trump, I said, That sounds good to me
trump, Nobody does it
trump, Nobody can do it
trump, We have the whole thing and we bought in a lot of those planes, we bought in a lot of great stuff
trump, And I won't tell you the story, but very early on I thought we were going to have a problem someplace, and one of the generals came up to me and said, Sir, don't go
trump, Don't do it
trump, Why We don't have the ammunition
trump, And I said two things
trump, I never want to hear a President
trump, Right We never want to have a President hear that again, nor do we want a President to have to go through the crap that we were going through back then
trump, But, another thing we did, which to me is such an incredible thing to have done
trump, It's such an honor
trump, So our last US Armed Forces, the last branch was the Air Force, right That was many, many decades ago
trump, We are now building and we have now gotten funding for the sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces, The Space Force
trump, So I'll be able to tell my kids someday and everybody else, See that Space Force That was my baby
trump, And you think that was easy That's not easy
trump, Because you have Democrats that do not like our military
trump, They do not like our military
trump, And we did something yesterday, because for three years I would see people that run… Incredible people, the heads of the Historically Black Colleges and Universities in the country
trump, And every year they'd come in and they'd be looking for help
trump, They needed help and they do need help with it and it's great and they do an incredible job
trump, So many great schools, but they need help
trump, And every year they'd have to come and come
trump, I got to know them actually
trump, I said, The only bad thing is you won't see me too much anymore
trump, Because we just provided record funding for a nation's Historically Black Colleges and Universities
trump, And it's longterm, they're not going to have to come
trump, So I said, Look, we could do it where we do it every year or we'll do what we have
trump, What do you want They said, Let us just have it
trump, So we'll miss them
trump, But they are great people
trump, They've done an incredible job
trump, And our extraordinary jobs boom, which created another 266,000 jobs last month, and then you add the undercount from the previous two months, you're close to 300,000 jobs
trump, And they said, if you're a business watcher which I am, I love watching business, but they said they were guessing, could be 70,000, could be 80,000, maybe 90, maybe 110, somebody said
trump, Then the number comes out, 266,000 with an adjustment
trump, Remember about four months ago when we had one little period, right We had one little period where there was a little downturn
trump, They said, Oh, Oh, we think we're going into a recession
trump, I said, Don't worry about it
trump, We think we're going into a recession
trump, They were willing to lose their wealth
trump, They were willing for this stocks and whatever the hell they own, what do you guys own back there Let it go
trump, They'll go bust
trump, They don't care
trump, Anything to get rid of us
trump, Not me, us
trump, And you know what Then all of a sudden, and now for the last couple of weeks, we've set brand new records in the history of the various stock markets
trump, So, as of yesterday, we've had 133 record days in the stock market now, and that's in less than three years
trump, So when I see that I don't care because I don't… I'm not allowed to have stock
trump, I can't have stock
trump, They consider it a conflict of interest and that I can understand
trump, I agree
trump, I can
trump, But you know what I'll tell you what
trump, What I see, I see tremendous job growth because we're setting records
trump, But you know what I also see The 401ks where people are up 90, they're up 97, they're up 82
trump, I tell you the story all the time
trump, I mean, I have people coming up to me, and a man came up, a policeman
trump, I've told this story, but I've had many, so many times, but this guy in particular, because it was early and that was a year ago
trump, That was a long time ago
trump, Right now it's much higher than that
trump, But he said, Sir, I want to thank you
trump, My wife thinks I'm a loser
trump, All my life, we never did well with the 401ks, with stocks
trump, Everything I invested, I'm up 72, sir
trump, She thinks I'm a financial genius
trump, She's so in love with me
trump, She so in love
trump, He said, She said, ‘Darling, I think you're one of the greatest investors
trump, Why don't you do this professionally' And I don't even know what I'm doing, sir
trump, I just have all these stocks
trump, So I just wanted to tell you, I look at a 401k, who has 401ks here So that's what I see
trump, I don't care about the rich ones
trump, I care about everybody
trump, I care
trump, I care about everybody actually
trump, Ford motor company just announced that it is investing 1
trump,5 billion dollars into auto factories in the Detroit area, creating another 3000 Michigan jobs
trump, And that's on top of the many other investments we've gotten from Japanese companies, car companies, and other companies
trump, But they're all coming in and a lot of them are coming to Michigan
trump, And I say, Hey, go to Michigan
trump, Sometimes they'll go south and that's okay, whatever
trump, I want them in this country
trump, But ideally I want to fill them up
trump, We're doing so well in Michigan with the auto companies
trump, Now you're back
trump, You're back
trump, So, you're back
trump, Very proud of you
trump, Very proud of you
trump, But while we're creating jobs, fighting for Michigan workers, and achieving numbers that you've never seen before, incredible victories for the American people are happening
trump, The radical left in Congress is consumed with hatred and envy and rage
trump, You see what's going on I'll tell you, these people are crazy
trump, You ever hear, It's the economy, stupid
trump, You know that was Clinton's saying
trump, If you have a good economy
trump, I have the greatest economy in the history of this country and nobody talks about it
trump, Nobody talks about it
trump, If you're a Democrat, they say,  Oh, it's the economy… If the economy's any good
trump, And let me just tell you a little secret
trump, If crooked Hillary would've won, your economy would have crashed
trump, You were going down
trump, The regulations were taking it down
trump, The taxes were taking it down, instead of being up 92 or whatever you're up, a lot, you would have been down, you would have been at less than half
trump, It was crashing
trump, For all those people that would say, Oh, it's the Obama… Let me tell you something
trump, You were dying
trump, And if you look at that first period of a couple of months, it was a disaster, but it was heading south
trump, And as sure as you're standing, and I'm sorry we couldn't get you seats, we didn't have any room
trump, And by the way, 20,000 people outside had to leave
trump, You know It's so cold outside we told them, Don't worry about a screen, go home, go home and watch
trump, But we had, this is about a 5,500 seat arena
trump, And I said to my people, Why so small Are we spoiled I watch these guys come in like Biden, he has a big rally and they get 93 people show up
trump, No, it's true
trump, I don't understand it
trump, And did you see the new polls from USA Today came out I'm killing everybody
trump, And they hate me
trump, USA Today hates me
trump, But there's a poll, we're beating everybody
trump, But, so Biden has this rally, they've got 200 seats, but only a small number of people
trump, So you know what they do They set up a round table
trump, So think of these people
trump, They come in, they think they're going to listen to the speech, they end up sitting on a round table discussing… They must've been happy, right We don't have enough room for round tables
trump, I'm sorry folks
trump, No, they set up a round table but I think we're doing great
trump, And how do you beat what we've done With the economy, with our great vets, with choice
trump, You've finally got choice
trump, They've been trying to get it for almost 50 years
trump, Four more years
trump, Four more years
trump, Four more years
trump, Four more years
trump, Four more years
trump, Four more years
trump, And these people back here Your seat or stand is better
trump, Right But you know what They're going to be much more famous because the cameras can't see you
trump, They can only see them
trump, And the other thing, the cameras, do you ever notice, I go to these stadiums, 25, 30,000 people
trump, They never show the crowd
trump, You know why Because they don't want to have… If crazy Pocahontas, if crazy Pocahontas goes to the middle of Central Park or whatever
trump, She's in Manhattan
trump, You got me
trump, And people, I mean, I could have, I could have Baron Trump go into Central Park and he'd get a crowd that would be just as… He's 13
trump, He'd get a bigger crowd
trump, But if she has the crowd, Oh, these crowds are so big
trump, I've had crowds over the last couple of weeks
trump, We went to different Pennsylvania, Florida
trump, But I mean thousands and thousands of people can't get into these NBA arenas, right Big arenas
trump, And we set records at everyone because we use the floor
trump, Thank you
trump, I appreciate it
trump, But we use the floor, right The basketball court
trump, So we set records at every arena
trump, They never even mention the crowds
trump, They never mention the crowds
trump, It's sort of amazing
trump, You know what I don't think we've ever had an empty seat from the time I came down the escalator
trump, That's a long time ago
trump, I don't think we've ever had an empty seat
trump, Now what the crooked media does though, if you got like over here, look how packed it is and there's thousands outside, but I… Please go home
trump, You're going to catch pneumonia
trump, But here's the thing
trump, If this man and that beautiful woman happened to get up because they want to go to the bathroom, those cameras will turn to those two seats and they'll say Trump wasn't able to fill up the arena
trump, I always get nervous when I see some… I know they're coming back
trump, Nobody ever leaves our speeches
trump, Because is there a better place to be in the world than a Trump rally But every time I see a man get up, I see a beautiful woman with a baby and they're getting up
trump, The baby's going crazy and they're getting up
trump, They're going to take it… But I know they're going to be right back
trump, And I say, Fill those two seats
trump, I don't want them to see it
trump, Because they'll say, Couldn't fill up the arena
trump, These are truly dishonest people
trump, After three years of sinister witch hunts, hoaxes, scams, tonight the House Democrats are trying to nullify the ballots of tens of millions of patriotic Americans
trump, Capped off with one of the greatest election evenings in history
trump, Was that the greatest Remember when they all said, remember when they all said, No, no
trump, You can't win Michigan
trump, You can't
trump, Then I went, I did one in Grand Rapids, right Grand Rapids
trump, We had 32,000 people that night
trump, It was one o'clock in the morning
trump, That means it was Election Day when I started speaking
trump, Hillary, Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, and Bill Clinton, they did an emergency trip
trump, They did an emergency trip to Michigan at six o'clock
trump, They got here at prime time
trump, They started to speak
trump, She had 500 people
trump, I got here at one o'clock in the morning the next day, which is now Election Day
trump, How many people were there 32,000 people outside, inside
trump, It was the last speech of Michigan
trump, And they say, Well, sir, it's very hard to win Michigan
trump, I said, Why would it be hard Here's the beautiful thing
trump, Everything I told you I've done, but much more so
trump, I said I was going to bring car companies back
trump, I said I was going to bring in… I just hope you people know that
trump, I just hope you know it
trump, But I'll never forget that night
trump, And in all fairness to Bill Clinton, he used to be a friend of mine until I ran for office
trump, I like him, I like him
trump, But he told, you know the way they tried to shut him out, right Because he's a pro
trump, He's an instinct guy, right He's instinct
trump, He doesn't need… Right Because he's a pro
trump, He's an instinct guy, right He's instinct
trump, He doesn't need polling companies
trump, Who the hell wants him You know, if you want a polling company, pick up the newspaper
trump, The problem is the newspaper polls are more fake than the news they write
trump, They write fake polls
trump, It's true, they write fake polls
trump, You call them suppression polls
trump, You read them and you get depressed, because it looks like you're doing badly
trump, They do that
trump, I think it's almost worse than what they write, and you can't get much worse than what they write
trump, So what happens is Bill Clinton said to Crooked Hillary, his very dishonest wife, Crooked Hillary
trump, Do you think he calls her Crooked Hillary He might
trump, Maybe he just calls her crooked He said, Crooked, I'm telling you
trump, Crooked, I don't like what I'm seeing in Michigan
trump, I don't like what I'm seeing in Wisconsin
trump, He said, I took the trip to Wisconsin and I'll tell you what, they had those TrumpPence signs all the way to the convention area, every lawn, every loan
trump, I don't like Wisconsin
trump, And then he said, Oh, don't worry about it
trump, What the hell does he know They told him, What do you know Remember, they shut him out at the … They didn't want him talking
trump, He was right
trump, I mean, I don't want to cause any problems in the family, but he was right
trump, But he talked about Wisconsin
trump, Then he talked about Michigan
trump, He said, Crooked, I'm telling you, Crooked, I don't like what I'm seeing in Michigan
trump, I was in Michigan and I'm telling you, they had those damn signs
trump, I saw some houses where they had four of them on one lawn, and two of them on the car
trump, And he said, You horrible human being
trump, You'd better start listening to me, because you're going to get your ass whooped And you know what happened You know what happened She didn't listen, fortunately
trump, And she didn't come to Michigan enough
trump, And she didn't come to Wisconsin, I think at all, right Because her polling data looked good
trump, It looked good to me, too
trump, Every time I went there with these crowds
trump, So we won Wisconsin
trump, We won Michigan and the great Ronna McDaniel … where is Ronna Where is Ronna Ronna, she was so horrible
trump, I didn't know her, Ronna McDaniel, and she was so aggressive
trump, She kept calling and said, Could you please come out to Michigan I said, Who the hell are you And I said, What do you mean, another trip So anyway, I made, we had these big crowds
trump, I made it again
trump, Then finally I said, two weeks out, I said, Ronna, no more
trump, We're going to win it or we're not
trump, Okay
trump, 00 in the evening for this final deal in Grand Rapids
trump, Sir, could you come to Michigan tonight And I thought, I was just about finished
trump, I went to a last great state, and I said, It's over
trump, Now I sit back and I watch, and let's see what happens, right But she said, Could you come to Michigan I said, that is the most aggressive human being I've ever met
trump, And we did it
trump, And we won Michigan
trump, And the word is that we're much higher right now in the polls than we were ever in 2016 in Michigan
trump, You better remember when you walk into … you know, it's November 3rd this time, November 3rd
trump, By the way though, that evening, that incredible evening in November, one of the biggest nights in the history of television
trump, You never hear them say it, so I might as well
trump, That election … and my debates … you see their debates are dying
trump, Who wants to watch Buttigieg, Buttigieg Buttigieg You know that you pronounce it they say … I heard some guy saying, No, no, because it's an unpronounceable name
trump, That's why they call him Mayor Pete, right Mayor Pete
trump, Mayor Pete
trump, Mayor Pete I've had you up to here, Mayor Pete
trump, No, Buttigieg is leading
trump, How does … no, you say it this way
trump, You say it … they call him Mayor Pete, because nobody can pronounce his last name
trump, That's the only … people think it says … by the way, you know what I'm not going to say bad things about him
trump, You know why I'd love him to win
trump, I thought I knocked off Pocahontas
trump, I did it a year too early, a year too early
trump, I give her credit, she then started to come back
trump, I don't think she's going to make it though
trump, She's gasping
trump, She's gasping for air
trump, But I saw them pronouncing Buttigieg, and they said, Here's what you do, boot edge edge
trump, Say, Edge, like the edge of a building
trump, Edge edge, Buttigieg
trump, Alfred E
trump, Newman
trump, You got to be older to know what that means
trump, But congressional Democrats are directly attacking 2
trump,3 million Michigan voters who rose up in 2016, won the state, and now the Democrats are very upset
trump, They want to get Michigan back
trump, They just don't know how to do it, because they didn't do a thing for Michigan
trump, They didn't do anything for Michigan
trump, All they did was take away your companies and let them go to Mexico and other places
trump, You know, I don't know if you know it, Mexico has 32 of your car business
trump, You know that, right Not because of me
trump, They're not moving
trump, But Mexico has … 32 of our car business moved to Mexico
trump, Can you believe this Before I got there, but that's what I used to talk about
trump, I said, when I was honored that night, I said, How do you let this happen How do you let all these companies leave It used to go, … it's probably maybe the single biggest reason I ran for president
trump, It might be the … and I had a lot of them
trump, Immigration, I had a lot of them, but that may be the single biggest
trump, With today's illegal unconstitutional and partisan impeachment, the do nothing Democrats, and they are do nothing … all they want to do is focus on this, what they could be doing … are declaring their deep hatred and disdain for the American voter
trump, This lawless, partisan impeachment is a political suicide march for the Democrat Party
trump, Have you seen my polls in the last four weeks It's crazy
trump, It's crazy
trump, You know why Because people, we have an election right down the road
trump, I announced three months ago that I'm running, right I'll give you a little clue
trump, I announced because I figured once I announce, they'd never impeach, nobody would be so stupid
trump, But they'd been trying to impeach me from day one
trump, They've been trying to impeach me from before I ran, okay Because if you remember when I ran, I went immediately to number one, never came off number one
trump, We had center stage from day one in the debates
trump, So we had, I don't know, 14, 15 debates
trump, We had a total of 18, actually
trump, People forgot there was one that they never talk about it, but that's okay
trump, But we had 18 people, and I was center stage
trump, And I said, Wait a minute, this is no good
trump, I want odd numbers, because of your center stage, if you have a 10 that means two people are in the middle
trump, So I said, Make it 11 or make it nine, or I'm not showing up
trump, And generally they did it, because we were way ahead from the beginning
trump, But I made a lot of great friends out of that group, and many of them are good friends today
trump, Although you wouldn't know it based on the … they say that was the meanest … that was a pretty mean primary, you got to say
trump, Wasn't that fun I liked it
trump, Through their depraved actions today, Crazy Nancy Pelosi's House Democrats have branded themselves with an eternal mark of shame, and it really is
trump, It's a disgrace
trump, Democrat lawmakers do not believe you have the right to select your own president
trump, They think that the Washington swamp, which we believe it or not, it ain't easy, because they got so much stacked, including these guys
trump, You know what These guys are apart of the Democrat Party
trump, They are a part of it
trump, You might as well call them Democrats
trump, You know, it's owned by Commicast
trump, They're just as bad as CNN, or they're just as bad as MSNBC
trump, And by the way, CNN and MSNBC, their ratings are down the tubes
trump, It's great
trump, I love it
trump, I love it
trump, But they think the Washington swamp should be able to veto the results of an election
trump, That's what they think
trump, There's never been a time like this
trump, Think of it, you have the greatest economy in the history of the world
trump, Other countries come to see me, all of their leaders, and they say, Sir,  first thing, Sir, congratulations on your economy
trump, We're trying to do the same thing
trump, Congratulations, sir
trump, And these guys don't like talking about it
trump, And if they do, they say, Obama did it
trump, Oh, Obama, Obama
trump, Remember Obama said, You will never be president
trump, He will never be president Then remember he said, I will consider it a personal front if you allow him to be president And then I became president
trump, He wasn't so happy
trump, And in all fairness, he campaigned harder than Crooked Hillary, because he had more strength
trump, I mean, I go to these places, Secret Service, they take me
trump, I haven't seen a lobby in three years
trump, It's true
trump, I go through basements
trump, I pass compactor plants
trump, I know more about compactors from this job
trump, I don't see lobbies
trump, I say Fellows, you think you could ever maybe take me through a lobby No, sir
trump, But I'll tell you what
trump, I go upstairs, downstairs, all around
trump, They're taking me up three flights, go down one
trump, I said, Are we almost there Yes, sir, another four flights
trump, And I say, You think Hillary could do this I don't think so
trump, They'd bring her back home
trump, She wants to go to sleep
trump, And now I hear she wants to run again
trump, Wouldn't that be great Oh
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you
trump, Oh would we love that You think the Democrats are screwed up Wait until that happens
trump, Wouldn't that be … Oh, there's my guy
trump, Lock her up
trump, Lock her up
trump, Lock her up
trump, Well look, based on the FBI report, you just saw what happened with the IG, where they came out with the FBI
trump, Based on that, you know what I never stopped you
trump, But now, think of what they did
trump, Think of what they did
trump, Think of how dishonest it all was
trump, They shouldn't even be allowed to have an impeachment, because it was based on dishonesty
trump, It was based on illegality
trump, She went out, and they paid for a fake dossier
trump, They gave money to foreigners to write a fake dossier, totally disproven, totally fake
trump, The FBI then took that fake dossier and they used it in the FISA Court to get approval to spy on my campaign
trump, And if we were Democrats, they would've been in jail two years ago
trump, It's a disgrace
trump, Think of what they did
trump, So they use this fake dossier, and they brought it before this big deal court
trump, It's a big deal, the FISA Court
trump, And they said this stuff, and they lied about it, because Comey, who's another beauty … did I do a great job when I fired his ass What a great job
trump, Oh no, they had bad plans
trump, No, I did a great thing
trump, That was like throwing a rock at a hornet's nest
trump, Did that place explode And then we learned about Lisa Page, and her wonderful lover, Peter Strzok
trump, I love you Lisa
trump, I love you more than anybody in the world
trump, I love you more than anybody in the world
trump, It causes problems with the wife, but we won't talk about that
trump, Those tapes didn't work well
trump, No, how about those statements, right And then they say, In all fairness, … I really liked the report, but how does the Inspector General say … because don't forget, he was appointed by Obama
trump, So I'm not knocking him because he gave us a lot of nuggets, but we had a lot of those nuggets
trump, How does the Inspector General say, You have these horrible … he's going to lose
trump, Isn't he He's going to lose, or she's going to win 100 million
trump, Did you see all the zeros It was like … I'm blinking
trump, I says, I think it's 100
trump, He's going to lose 100 to one
trump, Isn't he Peter I love you so much, Peter
trump, I've never loved anyone like you
trump, He's going to lose 100 million to one, Peter, right That's right
trump, He's going to lose 100 million to one
trump, But there's no bias
trump, How about the insurance policy To me, the greatest
trump, Just in case she loses, we have an insurance policy We're in the insurance policy right now folks We've been in it for three years, that's what they meant
trump, I mean the insurance policy is on an artificial respirator, because we're doing awfully well
trump, And I'll tell you something, Rush Limbaugh said it
trump, Sean Hannity said it
trump, Laura Ingram said it
trump, Tucker said it
trump, Ainsley said it, but a lot of people have said it
trump, They said, There's nobody in the world that could have handled that stuff that happened, and still created one of the greatest economies, and done more than any other president ever before in the first three years
trump, I understand that
trump, I understand that, but it's my life, very unfair to my family
trump, I have to say this very, very unfair to my family
trump, What they put my family through is a disgrace
trump, Me, it's my life
trump, It's fine
trump, I do
trump, But you know what What they put my family through is a disgrace, and they ought to be ashamed, and we should get apologies all over the place
trump, So yesterday I sent Pelosi a letter denouncing and condemning her party's outrageous abusive power
trump, That's what it is
trump, They have nothing
trump, They're the ones that should be impeached, every one of them
trump, I mean you got this guy, Schiff
trump, He makes up a statement, and he goes in front of Congress where he has immunity, and he makes up a statement from me that's totally fictitious, totally out of thin air
trump, The worst statement I've ever heard
trump, Many people saw it
trump, I had a person two weeks ago that said, I didn't love the statement you made
trump, I said, Really Didn't you read the transcripts I always say, Read the transcript
trump, But didn't you read it No, no
trump, I heard it on television
trump, I watched Adam Schiff
trump, He made it up
trump, I then sent him the transcript
trump, He said, Oh, now I feel better
trump, That's perfect
trump, I call it perfect
trump, He called it perfect
trump, Everyone calls it, if you read it
trump, But here's the thing
trump, He makes up this statement, and it finished
trump, Didn't he have eight quid pro quos Eight
trump, Could you imagine, you're dealing with a country, and you say eight times that you've got to do something
trump, The first time they say, Well
trump, The second time they say, That's strange
trump, Third time they say, What's wrong You said eight times Eight times
trump, They'd have you arrested
trump, They'd have you put into an insane asylum
trump, But he actually said … I think he said eight, not seven, eight
trump, And then he finished with, Don't call me, I'll call you
trump, Can you imagine The President of the United States, Don't call me, I'll call you
trump, You know what that is That's a mafia statement, okay That's the head of the mafia saying, Don't call me
trump, This guy actually said that, and then he walked away and people became incensed, because they knew that wasn't the people that read the thing
trump, Most people believed him
trump, He's a liar Because you know, he's a corrupt politician, 100
trump, No, he's a corrupt … and then I see him
trump, By the way, you ever see this guy He walks up to the mics
trump, I mean, we're not … all fairness, look, I don't want to be … because with Me Too, I never even think about looks anymore, okay I don't talk about looks of a male or a female, but in his case, let's just say … the last time I'll ever refer to this
trump, He's not exactly the best looking guy we've ever seen
trump, No, any mic
trump, He walks up to the mic, and he's so just, This is a sad, sad day for America
trump, Our president is an employee of Russia
trump, I have absolute proof that the president, this is at the beginning, and every week they'd say, Where's the proof It's coming
trump, It's coming
trump, Then we get the Mueller report, nothing
trump, And I'll tell you what, I know some of the people in this audience
trump, If I spent not 45 million, not 18 Trump haters, I call them the angry Democrats
trump, It was 13, then it went to 18, and then Mueller
trump, Did Muller do a good job Did he do a good job No Boo How was his performance in front of Congress Boo Not the best, but think of this, 45 million they spent
trump, And you know, I heard somebody say, Well, we got back some of that money
trump, Let me tell you, you cost this country billions, and billions, and billions of dollars in all of the things that didn't get done, in all of the embarrassment to our country
trump, You caused billions and billions of dollars, and it was a hoax
trump, But this guy, Schiff, I have absolute proof
trump, I have this
trump, I have that, this, that
trump, Anytime he sees a camera and he's stone faced, stone faced
trump, He's a pathological liar
trump, He gets up, and I've never seen anything like it
trump, Even I was saying, I wonder what he has
trump, What does he have He says, I have absolute, I said, I haven't spoken to Russia in year
trump, What the hell do I have to do with Russia But this guy gets up … oh, I think we have a vote coming in
trump, Haleigh Wow Thank you, Haleigh, great job
trump, Wow
trump, The Republican party has never been so affronted, but they've never been so united as they are right now, ever, never
trump, And I know the senators, and they're great guys, and women too
trump, We have some great women
trump, We have great guys
trump, They're great people
trump, They love this country
trump, They're going to do the right thing
trump, They're going to do the right thing
trump, So I said in my letter to Pelosi … I love that
trump, You know, usually there's one, two
trump, The Republicans, look, I've said it for a long time
trump, The Democrats are lousy politicians, they really are
trump, They've got horrible policies, open borders, crime is fine, drugs pouring through
trump, I mean, think of what they do
trump, Sanctuary cities, they love sanctuary cities
trump, They're lousy politicians, but they have one thing … two things
trump, They are vicious
trump, They're the most vicious people
trump, The Republicans aren't as vicious
trump, They may learn to be vicious after going through this, though
trump, But the other thing, the Democrats always stick together
trump, Now think of it, three Democrats went over to our side, no Republicans
trump, It's unheard of
trump, And by the way, this is for a hundred years
trump, I'm not just talking about this little point in time
trump, The Republicans are known as, it's always harder to stick together
trump, These people are great
trump, We have a great Republican Party, and we have to get that change
trump, We have to take back the house
trump, You'll have the greatest healthcare ever if we take … and by the way, we had another victory
trump, The individual mandate, just a little while ago, it came over the wires, it was just upheld
trump, The individual mandate is now gone
trump, The most unpopular part of Obamacare
trump, It was just upheld
trump, So I said in my letter to Pelosi, By proceeding with your invalid impeachment, you're violating your oath of office
trump, You're breaking your allegiance to the Constitution
trump, You're declaring open war on American democracy
trump, You dare to invoke the founding fathers in pursuit of this election nullification scheme, yet your spiteful actions display unfettered contempt for America's founding, and your egregious conduct
trump, And listen though, it's so true, it threatens to destroy what our founders pledged, and in fact their very lives to build
trump, You are the ones interfering in America's elections
trump, You are the one subverting America's democracy
trump, We did nothing wrong, nothing whatsoever
trump, This was just an excuse
trump, You are the ones that are obstructing justice
trump, You are the ones bringing pain and suffering to our republic for your own selfish, personal, political and partisan gain
trump, They're bringing pain
trump, The work we could be doing on lowering drug prices, on getting rid of these horrible, horrible situations
trump, You know in the border … the woman is okay Is she okay Okay, thank you very much
trump, Thank you
trump, I mean, some of these people are waiting here for three days, right Thank you
trump, They'll come back
trump, Come back
trump, Merry Christmas Thank you
trump, Merry Christmas is true
trump, But what they've done with this perversion, it's perversion
trump, And when you watch some of these people get up and speak today, they don't even … You have violated the Constitution
trump, Well, what does he done wrong Well, we don't know that
trump, They don't even have any crime
trump, This is the first impeachment where there's no crime
trump, I say, Tell me what I did, please
trump, Well, we don't know
trump, You violated the Constitution
trump, You had Turley, who's smart, Alan Dershowitz, these guys
trump, All of them, they said, There's no crime
trump, There's no crime, right There's no crime There's no crime I'm the first person that ever get impeached, and there's no crime
trump, I feel guilty
trump, You know what they call it Impeachment light
trump, It's impeachment light
trump, That's why, with Richard Nixon, I just see it as a very dark era, very dark, very … oh, you don't even like to think
trump, I don't know about you, but I'm having a good time, it's crazy
trump, But I also know we have a great group of people behind us in the Republican Party, we really do
trump, Maybe I wouldn't feel the same way, but we have a great group of people behind us
trump, We had in the House, and we have it in the Senate
trump, They're doing a great job, so I'm not worried
trump, I'm not worried, because it's always good when you don't do anything wrong, you get impeached
trump, That may be a record that will last forever
trump, But you know what they have done They've cheapened the impeachment process
trump, And now anybody that become … this is a sacred position
trump, Anybody that becomes president, I mean, they could have a phone call and they get impeached
trump, So if the Republicans … if you had a Democrat as president, we have a Republican house, they don't like the guy for whatever reason, or the woman, they impeach the person
trump, It's cheapened it
trump, It's exactly what our founding fathers didn't want, and they said it could happen, and it's happened
trump, But I know one thing, Americans will show up by the tens of millions next year to vote Pelosi the hell out of office
trump, But it's so disappointing
trump, I see a woman, Carolyn Maloney
trump, She's a long time, nothing much, believe me
trump, She's a Congresswoman from Manhattan, the east side
trump, I was with her
trump, Her first race, I helped her
trump, She was always so nice, Oh, thank you, thank you
trump, I made lots of contributions over the years
trump, In New York, if you're not a … it's purely Democrat, especially in Manhattan
trump, So what happens I make lots of contributions for years, and years, and years
trump, I go run
trump, The first person I see, Carolyn Maloney
trump, I raise my hand to impeach
trump, Well, give me back the damn money that I've been paying her for so many years
trump, Let her pay me back all the money
trump, Let her pay me back all the money
trump, Then you have this Dingell
trump, Dingell, you know Dingell, from Michigan
trump, You know Dingell You ever hear of her, Michigan Debbie Dingell, that's a real beauty
trump, So she calls me up like eight months ago
trump, Her husband was here a long time, but I didn't give him the B treatment
trump, I didn't give him the C or the D
trump, I could've
trump, Nobody what is, you know I gave the A+ treatment
trump, Take down the flags
trump, While you're taking them down for ex-Congressman Dingell … Oh, okay  … do this, do that, do that, rotunda everything
trump, I gave him everything
trump, That's okay
trump, I don't want anything for it
trump, I don't need anything for anything
trump, She calls me up
trump, It's the nicest thing that's ever happened
trump, Thank you so much
trump, John would be so thrilled
trump, He's looking down
trump, He'd be so thrilled
trump, Thank you so much, sir
trump, I said, That's okay, don't worry about it
trump, Maybe he's looking up I don't know
trump, I don't know
trump, Maybe, maybe
trump, But let's assume he's looking down
trump, But I gave him A+, not A, not B+, not B
trump, I gave him the A+, and she called me
trump, She said, Oh, no
trump, I won't go into the conversation, because it's not fair do that
trump, But all I want to say is, let's put it this way, it was the most profuse thank you that you could ever get on a scale of zero to 10, it was a 10
trump, Okay, so that was what February or something
trump, Now they talk about this phony impeachment, and she's out there, Well, we have to look seriously at our president, because he may have violated the Constitution of the United States
trump, Boo And I can't be happy with that, because I love our country
trump, I love this, and I love that
trump, She loves everything
trump, I said, She's a no, okay No, but I look at her, and she's so sincere, and what happens I vote to impeach Trump
trump, And you know what I didn't say, Who the hell knew this was even going to come up I went through the whole Muller hoax
trump, They did this big report
trump, I was totally exonerated
trump, They didn't even bring it up at the impeachment, because I was totally exonerated
trump, If they saw one little kernel, one little quarter of a sentence … look what they did with one word
trump, Remember this, what did I do Why did I do It's us
trump, But they don't say it that way
trump, They say, I
trump, They read it totally different, schiff and his band of thieves, they read it
trump, Now I say basically, very simple, do us a favor, our country
trump, Do us Do us Not me Our country And then what do I say I say, The United States Attorney General, Attorney General of the United States could speak to you, it would be great, okay Because it's known for major corruption
trump, In fact, the new leader of Ukraine got in on a construction … on a platform where he looks for all of the problems of dishonesty, and everything that was going on in Ukraine, right He looked for it, that's how he got into office
trump, He got into office that way
trump, So we take it and they repeat it a thousand times, and they never say with the right … so I go wild, and we start
trump, And the Republicans have got it right
trump, Now we always correct him, but I use the word us
trump, Us is the United States, our country
trump, And then it actually says, I think, Comma, country, but they don't say that
trump, They say, Do me a favor
trump, How many times have you heard it Where they say in a speech And then the president said, do me a favor
trump, Well, that's not what I said
trump, I said, Do us a favor, our country
trump, And then I said, the Attorney General of the United States, I didn't say my campaign- I said the Attorney General of the United States, I didn't say my campaign manager
trump, Okay I said the attorney … And these people want to impeach the President of the United States for that Oh, and then what happened Right Then what happened So then, the President of Ukraine, who's a quality person, said there was no pressure exerted whatsoever
trump, That was a killer for the Democrats, right Then his foreign minister said the same thing
trump, He said there was no pressure exerted whatsoever
trump, There was no pressure
trump, That's a killer
trump, So now did you see what the Democrats did a couple of days ago They tried to say that he's not a strong person, that he was weak
trump, They used the word weak, that he was weak, and under the power of Trump, he said
trump, Do you know how insulting that is Anybody that becomes president of a country, and that's a big country and it's a tough country, you got to be tough
trump, He's tough
trump, But so what they're saying now is he was weak because the wording, it just doesn't fit
trump, Okay These are really dishonest people
trump, And if the press was fair, this thing never would have happened
trump, So the House Democrats are surrendering their majority, their dignity, their reputations
trump, They look like a bunch of fools
trump, And I'll tell you, we have a lot of new stars in the Republican Party, I could read off a list of 20 names
trump, But they're giving up their honor, and they'll receive a big backlash at the box office
trump, When you take a look, that ballot box, that ballot box on November 3rd, I think we're going to have crowds like we've never had
trump, And I'll tell you something, it used to be, they'd always say, Oh, the Republicans
trump, You know, in 2018, I didn't run
trump, I didn't run, right They all said, Oh, we didn't
trump, Well actually, we picked up two seats in the Senate that these guys never talk about
trump, We just approved 171 federal court justices, 171 federal justices, including courts of appeal, 171
trump, We'll be up, probably by the end of the year, to 182, and for that, I thank President Obama
trump, He gave me 142 openings
trump, He gave me 142
trump, I said to him, my people, I got there, because they say the most important thing you could do as a president is judges and Supreme Court
trump, We have two great Supreme Court judges
trump, Right Two Justices of the Supreme court, Kavanaugh, Gorsuch
trump, Two great men
trump, They're great
trump, And how about the pain that they put Justice Kavanaugh through, right Over a phony deal, I hate to tell you
trump, Over a phony deal
trump, What a disgrace, what they put that man through and that family through
trump, Just remember it come November
trump, You got to remember, it's a long time
trump, You know, in the life of Trump, 10 months is an eternity
trump, It's a long time
trump, Somebody said, Congratulations sir, you're going to win
trump, I said, Don't say that
trump, Just don't talk about it
trump, Let's always pretend you're one point down
trump, Like last time
trump, Going to be close
trump, Nope, it's going to be close
trump, But what they put that man through was horrible, what they put his family through was horrible
trump, And you know, those stories largely have been recanted
trump, And frankly, the ones that didn't recant, I don't know what a Supreme Court judge does, but he should sue them
trump, He should sue them
trump, So we want to take back the House, we'll hold the Senate, and we'll keep the White House
trump, You will have the greatest healthcare
trump, You will continue with the greatest judges
trump, You know, we have judges that are … We just had a great story in the Wall Street Journal
trump, I have to be always very truthful, because if I'm a little bit off, they call me a liar
trump, They'll say, He gets a Pinocchio, the stupid Washington Post, they have Pinocchio
trump, I mean, even if you're saying things perfectly, it's a Pinocchio
trump, There's nothing you can say where you don't get a Pinocchio
trump, But what happens, what happens is we have Wall Street Journal the other day got the best story
trump, They said, Whether you like him or not, the job he's done on judges and Supreme Court Justices, but the job he's done on judges is amazing
trump, Say it's the most important thing
trump, See, I don't agree
trump, I say defense is the most, the military is the most
trump, But once you're beyond the military, I mean to me defense is the most important
trump, Because without good defense, maybe we don't need judges so much, right It's like somebody said, Well, we violated the budget
trump, I said, Do me a favor, don't worry about the budget
trump, If we're attacked and aren't doing very well and somebody says, ‘Well, at least we have a good budget,' that doesn't work too well
trump, Right That doesn't work
trump, So we have great military, we have great judges, we have great everything
trump, Drug prices down
trump, For the first time in 51 years, drug prices came down
trump, And that was with no help from the Democrats
trump, If they helped, because you need their votes, if they helped, I could get those drug prices down 40 and 50
trump, Okay And we just approved, and we're approving very soon for the Governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, where he can buy, he has the right to go, we're giving him the right to go and buy from a foreign country, where the prices for the identical drug, identical drug are 50 less
trump, He's going to do that for the people of Florida
trump, And we're going to do that for your governors if they want to do that
trump, We'll get that down so far
trump, Everyone in America can see straight through the Washington Democrats' phony, dangerous charade
trump, Schiff makes up so many things
trump, Pelosi makes it up, and she backs him up
trump, I saw her on a television show, and George Stephanopoulos, that's another beauty, he said, even he said, he was defending me
trump, I couldn't believe it
trump, He made this statement, But you know he lied on that
trump, He made up this stuff
trump, No, he didn't, he didn't
trump, So that means Nancy Pelosi said no, the statement that he made up
trump, But it's all going to end soon, and it's going to come out to a beautiful, great victory for the Republican Party and for this nation
trump, Thank you very much
trump, So that's it
trump, We have the greatest country
trump, We've turned around a ship
trump, We need four more years
trump, If we don't have it … Now, if you want to drive them crazy, we had one group in Pennsylvania, some guy started screaming,  16 more years
trump, 16
trump, They went crazy
trump, And you know what they don't understand When I do get out, they're all going to go out of business
trump, They're making more money than they've ever made
trump, That crazy New York Times, one of the worst newspapers in the world, one of the most dishonest newspapers in the history of the world, totally phony
trump, They came out with a story, where it was a great headline for me, and the people that read it, the super radical left, they called and complained so much that they changed the headline and took it from positive to negative on a good story
trump, Can you believe it No, they're among the most dishonest people
trump, But I'll never forget, before I took that great escalator ride down with our First Lady … Our First Lady is doing a great job, great job
trump, I said, First Lady, you're so lucky I took you on this journey, this wonderful, beautiful journey
trump, And it is
trump, You know why it's a wonderful, beautiful journey Because look at, what we're accomplishing is unbelievable
trump, It's unprecedented
trump, It is unprecedented what we're accomplishing
trump, You're so lucky, I said it to all my people
trump, I have great people in the back
trump, I say, You folks are so lucky I took you on this
trump, You could be home right now, relaxing
trump, But I'd rather be here, frankly, than any place
trump, These rallies are great
trump, They're inspiring
trump, You are inspiring
trump, And you know, it's funny, we're not even into election season
trump, Yeah, it's a long way away
trump, We're not even in it
trump, And yet, I think the enthusiasm right now is greater than it was even before the 2016 election
trump, Does that make any sense I think a lot of it has to do with a witch hunt
trump, A lot of it has to do with the phony, witch hunt because you're smart people
trump, You're the elite
trump, They're not the elite
trump, You're the elite
trump, You're the elite
trump, You do better than they do
trump, They talk about it, don't you hate it Well, the elite …  Oh really I went to better schools
trump, Many of you went to better schools
trump, We won't talk about homes, even though your homes are nicer
trump, We won't talk about jobs
trump, You see the jobs reports You see what's happening Do you see where wages are going up You know, when I first started, when I was here, one of my first speeches, I was talking that people made more money, that was four years ago, so it was 20 years before that, so that's 24, 25 years ago
trump, They made more money 24 years ago than they were making when I got elected president
trump, And they worked one job versus two or three jobs
trump, Now it's going up beautifully and we want that, the salaries
trump, And you know, the number one group of people that are going up is the blue collar worker
trump, It's percentage, the best
trump, The blue collar worker
trump, They had two and three jobs
trump, The blue collar worker is going up the most
trump, Anyway, so you know what else The thing I'm happiest about, African American unemployment, the lowest in the history of our country
trump, African American
trump, Remember I used to say, you remember, look at, you
trump, Are you the greatest guy Everyone thinks, do I pay I'm telling you, I have a group of African American guys, and gals by the way, that follow me around and they think I pay them, and I don't
trump, I love them, they love me
trump, They come
trump, How many rallies have you come to A lot
trump, They're great people, just great
trump, Thank you
trump, I don't even know who the hell he is
trump, Is that right I don't know him, but I like him
trump, I see him at so many rallies
trump, I appreciate it
trump, You and your group, they're great people
trump, Thank you
trump, So you're obviously doing well if you can travel around like that, right Ah, he knows
trump, I appreciate it, I really do
trump, I think it's fantastic
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you
trump, But think of this, African-American unemployment is the lowest it's ever been in the history of our country
trump, Their poverty levels, they had a horrible poverty level, in the negative sense, now their poverty levels are the best they've ever been in the history of our country
trump, Same with Hispanic Americans, the best unemployment numbers and employment numbers
trump, And the same with Asians, the best unemployment
trump, And women, I'm sorry, 71 years, best in 71 years
trump, I've let the women down But I think within another couple of months, you'll be historical
trump, So only 71 years best
trump, The best in 71 years
trump, But what we're doing has been an incredible thing
trump, It's an incredible thing
trump, When I'm on the debate stage with one of these characters, and they try and say negative stuff, I'll just say, Well, here's the story
trump, In the history of our country, this group is doing the best, and that group is doing the best, and the women are doing the best, and everybody's doing
trump, And frankly, you know what it is The whole country's doing the best
trump, Okay The whole country is doing the best
trump, So we have records and everything, and yet they're trying to, and they really are, I've never seen anything like it, they're accusing me, really, of doing what Joe Biden … Biden admitted what he did
trump, How about this They protect him
trump, Did you see the crummy debate Those debates are so boring
trump, They're dying in the ratings
trump, They're dying, they're dying
trump,  While it's totally unsupported What's unsupported He's on tape saying that he's holding back 1 billion from Ukraine unless you change the prosecutor
trump, How about that question I won't say who answered, because you know I'm not, I actually used to like the guy, he was a nice guy to me, but now I don't like him so much, but that's okay
trump, But he goes, While it's totally unsubstantiated, and while we beg your mercy that we're asking you even to bring up this question, but President Trump said you refused to give 1 billion of taxpayer money to Ukraine unless they get the prosecutor to stop looking at your son and your son's company
trump, And Sleepy Joe gives a sleepy answer, and that's the end of it
trump, That's it
trump, Then whenever I bring it up, do you ever notice they always use,  While these charges are totally unsubstantiated He's on tape If that were me, it's the electric chair
trump, They would bring the electric chair back
trump, No, the guy's on tape, and they always say it's unsubstantiated
trump, It is not supported by fact, one of them the other day, they finally changed the word
trump, It is supported by fact
trump, No, it's supported by tape
trump, No, it's unbelievable
trump, In many ways, I'd like to have him win because number one, he's going to have to eventually answer that question, and number … She said he doesn't know where he is
trump, That's the other problem
trump, Now, I've been doing this for a long time, and I have much bigger crowds than anybody's ever had in history
trump, By the way, do you know what I say it against the fake news, because you know what they're going to say
trump, Every stadium is packed
trump, I give my people one instruction, get the largest stadium you can get
trump, Now, that's why I was a little surprised
trump, But in Battle Creek, you don't have that many, right Not too many stadiums
trump, But I wanted to be here
trump, You know why I wanted to be here First of all the crowd is incredible
trump, The crowd outside
trump, But let me tell you
trump, No, you know why I wanted to be here Because we have a lot of choices, but I wanted to be here because this area supported me so overwhelmingly, and I said, I want to be there
trump, Pretty simple, pretty simple
trump, Pretty simple
trump, I wanted to be here for that reason, and I just want to say thank you, because I'll tell you what, you came in … I don't know, I didn't get 100, but we got a damn good percentage, right We got a damn good percentage
trump, So it's really thrilling to be here
trump, But we're joined tonight by many terrific Republican leaders
trump, Your Michigan House Speaker, Lee Chatfield
trump, Where's Lee Lee, come up if you want
trump, Come on, what the hell, we have nothing else to do
trump, Should we get him up Yes
trump, Come up Lee, come up Lee, get up here
trump, Come on up, Lee
trump, Republican Party Chairwoman, Ronna McDaniel, who I spoke to
trump, And the bottom line on the end of her story, so when I won I said, Who's going to head up the RNC I said, I got to get that woman from Michigan
trump, Remember they were all saying, You can't win Michigan Now we're going to win it by so much, you better remember all those
trump, Every time a car plant opens, please think about Trump
trump, Come on up here, Lee
trump, Michigan GOP Chairwoman, Laura Cox
trump, Thank you
trump, Hate to tell you, but all your congressmen, you know where they are right now
trump, Your congressmen, all of your Congresspeople, men, wonderful people, they're at a place called Congress right now
trump, They're doing an unbelievable job of supporting your President and supporting you
trump, They had a choice, Sir, should we leave and be there I said, Don't leave
trump, Stay right where you are
trump, That's why we got that vote
trump, That's some vote, right Lee The Chairman of the Woman's Workers and Workers for Trump, and a proud union autoworker, Terry Bowman, who's been so terrific
trump, Thank you, Terry
trump, Come on up
trump, And while Democrats are obsessed with impeachment, we're focused on jobs, jobs, jobs
trump, This group, local leaders
trump, And all your Washington folks, they are right where they have to be in Washington tonight
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you
trump, Great job
trump, Thank you very much
trump, We've eliminated more job-killing regulations than any administration in the history of our country, whether it's four years or eight years, or in one case, much more than eight years
trump, In a period of two and a half years, we have eliminated more regulations than any other president, by far
trump, You're saving almost 3,000 a year because of regulation cuts
trump, Total income gains for median households will reach 10,000 a family
trump, I'll give you a couple of quick numbers
trump, So under President Bush, for eight years, you saved 450, meaning you took in 450 bucks
trump, Okay, fine
trump, Under President Obama, you took in 975
trump, Under President Trump, including the energy savings, and the regulation savings, and the tax cut savings, it's more than 10,000 in less than three years
trump, Pretty good, right So for two eight-years, you had a 400, 450, and a 975
trump, That's eight years
trump, 450
trump, In less than three years, you had more than 10,000
trump, That goes right into your pockets
trump, It's one of the reasons our economy is doing well, because, as they say, the consumer is doing better than they've ever done
trump, And that's great, that's what we wanted
trump, We've ended the war on American energy, and the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas on planet earth
trump, And these maniacs want to close it up
trump, How about going to Texas You know Beto What Remember what he said, I said, Oh, this guy's a loser
trump, You know a salesman, like if you're a great salesman, you never talk that you're a great salesman
trump, You don't walk in and say, Well, I'm a great salesman
trump, I can sell …  Any guy that does that, they're no good
trump, It's those quiet type that get you
trump, You know, the ones that don't talk
trump, So Beto, when he first got in, remember this clown He gets in, no, no, he gets in
trump, I was made for this job, to run for president
trump, After about two weeks, they killed him
trump, He was gone
trump, But you remember, he was against the Bible, he was against religion, he was against guns, and he was against oil and gas
trump, And he comes from Texas
trump, I said, that's a platform
trump, Think of it
trump, He's against religion, he's against guns, and against oil and gas
trump, Think of it
trump, I don't like to bring it up because he's gone zone, but he comes from Texas
trump, I said, Abraham Lincoln can't win in Texas with that platform
trump, But they are, all of them, they want to close up your energy
trump, It's a big deal
trump, They want to close up your steel mills
trump, They don't want your steel mills
trump, Look at what I've done for steel
trump, I mean, the steel is back
trump, We taxed all of the dump steel coming in from China and other places, and your steel mills that are doing great, they're expanding all over the country
trump, And they were going to be out of business within two years
trump, The way they were going, they were gone
trump, United States Steel is spending now billions of dollars on expansions
trump, Every major Democrat running for president has pledged to eliminate gas powered automobiles and destroy the U
trump,S
trump, auto industry forever
trump, And you know why Because they have these maniacs that say you got to go all electric
trump, I want to have an alternative, a big alternative
trump, You're going to always have the alternative
trump, And a lot of people don't know of the electric can ever catch the gas, you know And by the way, there'll be different forms of energy coming along
trump, But they want to close them up, and we're not closing them up
trump, We're going to have lots of alternatives so that you can have it from a pricing, you can have it for a lot of different reasons
trump, We're even bringing back the old light bulb
trump, You heard about that, right The old light bulb, which is better
trump, I say, Why do I always look so orange You know why Because of the new light, they're terrible
trump, You look terrible
trump, They cost you many, many times more, like four or five times more
trump, And you know they're considered hazardous waste
trump, When a light bulb is out, you've got to bring it to a dump
trump, So let's say, over here in Battle Creek, where's your nearest dump Okay, that's what, a couple of hundred miles away
trump, So every time you lose … drive a couple of hundred miles, right I said, How many people do that Nobody
trump, What do they do They throw it in the garbage
trump, But you know what it is, because it's all gas
trump, It's much more expensive, four or five times more
trump, And I came into office, I did a lot of this
trump, Sinks, showers, all of this stuff, I did a lot of it
trump, No water comes out
trump, You have areas where there's so much water, you don't know what to do with it
trump, You turn on the shower, you're not allowed to have any water anymore
trump, I mean, we do a lot of it
trump, Dishwashers, we did the dishwasher, right You press it
trump, Remember the dishwasher, you'd press it, boom, there'd be like an explosion, five minutes later you open it up, the steam pours out, the dishes
trump, Now you press it 12 times, the women tell me, Again
trump, You know, they give you four drops of water, and they're in places where there's so much water, they don't know what to do with it
trump, So we just came out with a reg on dishwashers
trump, We're going back to the old
trump, By the way, by the time they press it 10 times, you spend more on water, and electric
trump, Don't forget, the whole thing is worse because you're spending all that money on electric
trump, So we're bringing back standards that are great, and better machinery that you can have the water again, right But with the light bulb, I said, What's going on with the light bulbs A lot of people are complaining about the cost
trump, So I had a couple of experts come in, I said, Tell me, what gives a better light Well, we liked the old light bulb better
trump, I said, I like it better
trump, And so what I did is you can have either one
trump, If you want to buy the newer kind, you can
trump, And if you want to look very handsome or beautiful by buying the older kind, like I do
trump, So we're bringing back the old light bulb
trump, So it's a much less expensive, it probably gives a better light
trump, But whatever it is, and you'll be able to spend a lot less money for a light bulb
trump, I mean, it sounds like little, but it's big stuff
trump, Okay It's big stuff, and we're doing it with a lot of other things, our dishwashers
trump, And you know, I won't tell you one of the things, because every time I tell you, they do a big number on it
trump, You know the one I'm talking about, right Sinks, right Showers
trump, And what goes with a sink and a shower 10 times, right 10 times
trump, Not me, of course, not me, but you, him
trump, But I never mention that, because one time I mentioned all three, I said, Sinks, showers, and toilets
trump, The headline was, Trump with the toilets, toilets
trump, That's all they want
trump, They don't even mention it
trump, So I didn't mention that, okay I go off the record
trump, But you know what It's terrible
trump, You want to wash your hands, you turn on the sink, no water comes out
trump, So you leave the water going 10 times as long, it's the same thing
trump, You have a shower, drip
trump, It's no good for me
trump, For me
trump, You know the one thing that came out really good about being in this business They always used to say I wore a hairpiece
trump, It's okay
trump, I know people wear hairpieces
trump, But they always used to say
trump, They don't say that anymore because I have been through the worst storms
trump, If you wear one of those suckers, you got to give it up fast because within two weeks they got you
trump, You look handsome, don't worry about it
trump, But in the last two decades before my election, we lost one in five auto manufacturing jobs in this country
trump, The people are trying to impeach us for doing all of the things that they've wanted to do for so many years
trump, And that's why it doesn't work
trump, We look so forward to taking it on, and it is all about cleaning the swamp, draining the swamp, and we have a very, very big, bad, dangerous swamp
trump, Okay, that's enough of that
trump, That's enough
trump, So among the very first acts that I did was to stop the deal that would have dealt a death blow to the U
trump,S
trump, auto industry
trump, I withdrew from the horrible Trans Pacific Partnership
trump, That would have ended your auto industry
trump, A lot of people don't know that, but I do
trump, Remember TPP We were basically ceding our auto industry to these countries that were just going to rip us off
trump, The people that made these trade deals, it's like, where do they come Like the one in Korea, that was a Hillary Clinton special
trump, She said, This will produce 250,000 new jobs
trump, And I said, Well, what happened He said, Well, she was right
trump, Except it was for South Korea, not for us
trump, No, it's true
trump, It produced 250,000 jobs for South Korea
trump, These deals were so bad
trump, But now they're getting really good, and some of them are getting great, and over a period of time they are going to be phenomenal
trump, Wait till you see the numbers that start coming out of this country over a short period of time
trump, But we have to go through a little pain, because we have to do it, and then they all say, We're going to withdraw, and then I say, You can withdraw, I don't care
trump, We're putting tariffs on your country
trump, Then they say, We'd love to make a deal, sir
trump, The new USMCA has powerful protections to keep auto manufacturing jobs right here in Michigan where they belong
trump, Since the election, we've created 41,000 brand new motor vehicle and parts jobs, manufacturing jobs
trump, Remember the statement by President Obama You'd have to wave a magic wand
trump, Remember the magic wand Because manufacturing … And I said, You know, that sounds strange
trump, What do you do if you don't have manufacturing How do you make things Right Manufacturing jobs won't happen
trump, Well, we've got 600,000 manufacturing jobs, and you're going to see a big, big increase
trump, The truth is, we need more people
trump, You know what We need more people
trump, We need more people coming into the country, and they're going to come in, and they're going to come in through merit, and they're going to love our country, and they're going to respect our country, and they're going to work
trump, We do need more people
trump, They're opening these massive, Foxconn in Wisconsin, they're opening these massive plants and it's hard to get people
trump, We want people coming in, but they have to come in, only they have to come in through merit
trump, Fiat-Chrysler recently announced a 4
trump,5 billion investment in Michigan, including the first new auto plant in Detroit in more than a generation
trump, And General Motors recently announced a 300 million investment at its Orion Assembly Plant right here in Michigan
trump, Come on, General Motors, let's go
trump, General Motors gave us a little hard time with one building
trump, I wasn't happy about that
trump, That was the only building I had a problem within the whole car industry, right Right You know the one I'm talking about
trump, I didn't like that
trump, Anyway, but they're spending money, you know, what can I tell you But these companies are coming in, a lot of the foreign companies are coming because they have to
trump, I say, You have to, or we're not trading with you anymore
trump, Because we had such big deficits with these countries
trump, With Japan, we had a 68 billion deficit
trump, I said, Shinzo, he's great Prime Minister of Japan
trump, But he said, But nobody has ever asked us to do this
trump, I said, I'm asking you
trump, They are building many, many plants
trump, They're building many plants now in the United States, the Japanese
trump, And after years of rebuilding foreign nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation
trump, Is that okay We were surrounded with globalists
trump, You know, they think it's okay
trump, You open a plant in some country that you never heard of, they make your product, they send it
trump, In the meantime, they close all their factories here
trump, We're not doing that anymore
trump, Those are globalists
trump, They think it's wonderful to have deficits
trump, I don't
trump, They think it's great
trump, It's a great thing to have deficits
trump, No, those are globalists
trump, The globalists are passe
trump,  our first duty and our one true allegiance is to you, the American people, before anybody else
trump, We must care for our own- We must care for our own citizens first Democrat immigration policies are resulting in brutal assaults and wicked murders against innocent Americans
trump, I don't even know what's happening
trump, It's terrible
trump, And we've moved out thousands and thousands of MS13 thugs out of our country
trump, And we have agreements now with Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador
trump, They didn't use to take them back
trump, If we had a murderer, then we should get them the hell out
trump, We don't really want them in our prisons and take care of them for 50, 60 years
trump, We want to bring them back
trump, They wouldn't take them
trump, The planes used to go around and around, don't land, don't land
trump, With us, they land
trump, We worked out deals with every one of them
trump, We stopped giving them all the aid
trump, We're giving them all this money and then they said, We're not going to let you land
trump, We're not going to let you take them back
trump, I said, That's okay
trump, 500 million, we were giving them
trump, I said, now we give them 5 we give them nothing
trump, All of a sudden they said, We would love to have them back
trump, We would love it
trump, It's wonderful to have them back
trump, In June, two illegal aliens in Sandusky, Michigan were convicted of sadistically beating and stabbing a woman to death with a kitchen knife
trump, Then, they hid her body in a water drain
trump, A criminal alien with two previous deportations was just arrested in Michigan and convicted of brutally beating and strangling to death, a single mother of five young children
trump, It's happening all the time
trump, Far left politicians support deadly sanctuary cities, which deliberately release dangerous, violent criminal aliens out of the jails and directly onto your streets
trump, We had a great election in North Carolina recently, two great congressmen got elected, you don't hear about it, when they win, you don't ever hear about it, just a few months ago
trump, Two great people and they got elected and they got elected because I went in and said, Talk about the fact that you have sanctuary cities and they had some horrible crimes happening from those sanctuary cities
trump, Soon as I mentioned that, boom, they went up like rocket ships and they won their elections and it was great
trump, Great thing
trump, The sanctuary cities are a disaster and let me tell you, the people of California, they don't like sanctuary cities either
trump, They're stuck with them because they have crazy politicians
trump, Earlier this year, authorities in the sanctuary jurisdiction of Kent County, Michigan, anybody know Kent County Released an illegal alien charged with assault with intent to murder after he repeatedly and viciously stabbed a man in the head with a broken bottle
trump, They let him go to roam free in Michigan communities
trump, If you want to end sanctuary cities in Michigan, if you want to protect your families from criminal aliens, if you want to have a safe life, frankly, it's so crazy what they're doing
trump, You wouldn't even believe it
trump, You have only one choice in 2020, you must vote Republican
trump, Thank you
trump, I'm surprised
trump, As you know, you do have sanctuary cities in Michigan
trump, I was almost surprised to hear it, but you have them
trump, It's one of those progressive things They think they're doing a wonderful favor for the world
trump, And now we're getting these prosecutors that, you murder somebody, they give you two months, they fight that you don't even have to go to jail
trump, What's going on is crazy
trump, Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, illegal crossings are down 75 since may and we've ended catch and release
trump, We've ended it
trump, We could've ended it so easily
trump, It's called the loophole
trump, You catch him and then you release him into a country
trump, That's what you had to do by law
trump, And if you don't do that, they arrest the border patrol people
trump, You believe this The border patrol people were in more danger than the criminal aliens coming in and some of these people are not good people
trump, These are the people because look, when you have a caravan of eight or 10,000 people, a lot of those people, do you think that Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, do you think they're sending us their finest I don't think so
trump, Alright
trump, How about the lottery That was a Schumer deal
trump, Chuck Schumer, crying Chuck, crying Chuck Schumer
trump, I used to be a big contributor to him, he used to kiss my ass, Chuck Schumer
trump, He'd do anything
trump, He would've done anything for me
trump, Anything I asked him, get Schumer on the phone, You do this, you do that
trump, You get him on the phone, that son of a bitch
trump, He would have done, I didn't need anything, but he would have done anything
trump, Now it's like, The prisoner has not acted-
trump, Give me a break
trump, Give me a break
trump, Find out how much money did I give a raise to Chuck Schumer and Chuck, give all that money back please
trump, Carolyn Maloney, give that money back
trump, Every penny should come back
trump, They act so pompous
trump, They act so righteous
trump, They're not righteous
trump, They're not righteous
trump, They're bad people
trump, The far left Democrats have never been more extreme than they are now
trump, Democrats are pushing a socialist takeover of healthcare that will take away your coverage and take away your doctor
trump, 180 million people are going to lose
trump, A lot of people here now have healthcare finally under us that's phenomenal
trump, And that's what you want
trump, They want to take it away, 180
trump, They want you to go to a hospital ward someplace and sit there all night
trump, I don't think so
trump, Not in this group
trump, And you know what Some people, it's good so people, but can you imagine They want to take away 180 million people, great, private, highly negotiated healthcare where you have your own doctor
trump, Remember Obama 28 times, You can have your doctor, you can have your plan
trump, Didn't work out that way, did it I think we should impeach him for that
trump, Let's impeach him, for that, for the IRS scandal, for the guns
trump, Remember the guns, he was giving them to anybody that wanted them
trump, He gave guns to the worst people in the world and then they didn't have them registered, right Not to good
trump, Impeach him
trump, Why didn't the Republicans impeach him Those were really, how about giving around 1
trump,8 billion in cash How about that By the way, I ended the Iran nuclear deal
trump, I hope you happy, much different country
trump, But how about giving Iran 1
trump,8 billion in cash
trump, Many big planes going over to Iran, loaded up to the ceiling with cash
trump, You know what 1
trump,8 billion, you ever see like at a casino, 1 million wrapped up It's a big pile of stuff, that's a million
trump, Now multiply it, 1
trump,8 billion in cash he gave
trump, So, why is he allow to do that Did anybody try to impeach him for that Everybody knew it was wrong
trump, Republicans will strongly protect patients with preexisting conditions and we will protect your preexisting physicians
trump, Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb, right up until the moment of birth
trump, Right That is why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift of God
trump, Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption
trump, And that's what it is
trump, The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, and the American dream
trump, And that's really what it is
trump, We're also the party of the great Abraham Lincoln
trump, A lot of people forget that, but we have to bring it up
trump, To protect the health and safety of our citizens, we awarded 100 million to improve water infrastructure in Flint
trump, How badly was Flint Who were the geniuses that did that to you You have clean water coming into Flint
trump, They had to pay a very tiny little fee
trump, So instead, they go into this horrible, horrible, really polluted water and the water comes out of there
trump, They spend hundreds of millions of dollars to save like a couple of bucks, and the water was so terrible and it hurt the people
trump, It hurt the people
trump, But we're getting it fixed
trump, And I know your previous governor was a Republican, but I was not a big fan of his
trump, I was not, but I'm not a big fan of the one that can't fix the potholes either
trump, We're committed to ensuring America has the cleanest air in the cleanest water on planet earth, and that's what it's about
trump, It's about clean air and it's about clean, beautiful water
trump, And it's about keeping our industry, not closing it because of the ridiculous Paris Climate Accord
trump, How's Paris doing I don't think too well
trump, How's Paris doing with the yellow vests The yellow vests You know why Because they raise gasoline prices so they could send them money all over the world to countries that the people in France never heard of
trump, It's not working out too well
trump, We're lowering prices
trump, We're lowering taxes
trump, We're making it possible
trump, I mean, look at gas prices now
trump, Look at gas prices
trump, I recognize Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem
trump, And we also recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights
trump, Big deal
trump, For years, you watched as your politicians apologized
trump, Member, I would like to apologize
trump, I would like to apologize
trump, Nah, we don't apologize
trump, Now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the great people of Michigan
trump, You're getting your auto industry back
trump, At stake in our present battle is the survival of the American nation
trump, If you want your children to grow up, a land of safety, it's really, we want a land of safety, justice
trump, Well, I don't know
trump, When I look at those FBI reports we got out, we got to clean up a lot
trump, What they've done to hurt people, what they've done to hurt with Comey and these horrible people, what they've done to hurt people
trump, I think one of the best things I did as president, a lot of people would say, With all what we've done for the economy and, but one of the best things is firing James Comey's ass out of there
trump, Boy, those reports are kept
trump, Did you see the other day Well, ah, ah
trump, First time now he said, in other words, he's 50 there folks
trump, He's hit the golden pond
trump, Anyway, so what we're doing is, we're doing things that are going to make our victory, it's like a tree
trump, We need that extra four years
trump, We've done so much, even Right to Try
trump, You know Right to Try People were traveling, they're terminally ill, they're traveling all over the world
trump, We have the best medical in the world, the best doctors, the best labs, best hospital
trump, They're traveling all over the world, to try and get, because it takes years to get something approved
trump, And I said, Wait a minute folks, why aren't we doing this And they've been trying to do it for 49 years
trump, They couldn't get it done
trump, Not that easy
trump, The drug companies didn't want the liability, the country didn't want the liability, the insurance companies didn't want the liability
trump, I said, Here's what we do
trump, We'll sign an agreement with the people where you're exculpated from all liability
trump, Huh That's a good idea
trump, And it's a very strong agreement so we can't get sued
trump, But I said, Listen, they were worried they're going to hurt people
trump, I said, These people are terminally ill
trump, They're terminally ill, and so we do it now
trump, Nine months ago, all the legislators at the 49 years, so if somebody's sick, they don't have to go to Asia, they're have to go to Europe
trump, Or if you're poor, you go home and you die
trump, Now what happens Very simple
trump, You sign that document, they work it out
trump, You wouldn't believe how many lives are being saved
trump, It's incredible
trump, It's incredible
trump, I'm very proud of it, Right to Try
trump, I hope you don't need it
trump, You don't want it
trump, You don't want it
trump, Okay But if you do, it's there
trump, With your help, we will lift millions of more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity
trump, Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration
trump, We will enact the greatest trade deals ever made
trump, They'll result in more products, proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase, made in the USA
trump, We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine
trump, What we're doing is unbelievable
trump, We're so far ahead of everybody
trump, What we've done in the last three years with the FDA and even the speed of what we're doing, it would take 12, 13, 14 years to get things approved
trump, It's down to a much smaller number, but we're finding new cures for childhood cancer and we are ending the AIDS epidemic in America
trump, We've started the process
trump, Who would've thought that In 10 years, it's a 10 year process, we will have ended the AIDS epidemic in America and it could have been been started before I came to office
trump, It was just wasted time
trump, We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms
trump, Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America
trump, We support, protect and defend the constitution of the United States
trump, We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement
trump, They're incredible, and that includes ICE
trump, You know how tough these people are These are great patriots
trump, They love our country
trump, Even the sheriffs alone for, some of the people that they're dealing with
trump, These guys walk into the golem's nest and in some cases they just swing it out
trump, They can have it
trump, They love it
trump, These are great
trump, If we didn't have them, and I told you before, they're taking out bad, bad, bad people by the thousands, especially MS13 gang members
trump, Who's going to do that Who's going to do that Anybody in the front row I don't know
trump, What about you You're a tough guy
trump, You might do it
trump, You could do it
trump, I don't know
trump, You might, yeah, you can
trump, What you like We're going to recruit you
trump, I think you could handle yourself
trump, Now, these are tough people, right You got to be tough
trump, Then they get accused, they're too tough
trump, Oh, they're too tough
trump, You have some of these guys
trump, They knife people
trump, They don't even need a gun because it's more painful
trump, They knife the two young girls, 16 years old
trump, Beautiful
trump, They cut them up into pieces because it was more painful than shooting them
trump, These are animals
trump, And then Nancy Pelosi said, I shouldn't use the term animal
trump, And by the way, she ought to go home and take care of her district where the homeless is all over the place and the tents and the filth and the garbage is a eroding right into the Pacific ocean and into their beaches
trump, She ought to go and take care of her district in San
trump, Do you see what's going on And it rains and it's filth and it's needles and it's drugs and it's, you know what
trump, It's everything and it goes right into those storm sewers
trump, Storm, not sanitary, storm and it goes right out into the Pacific ocean into the beaches and we fine Los Angeles and San Francisco, but we've just sent them a tremendous dollar fine for what they're doing
trump, And Nancy Pelosi is playing games
trump, She ought to go home and take care of the homeless and take care of the filth and everything
trump, San Francisco was the most beautiful city
trump, When you look at what's happened with the tents all over the place, where the police officers are getting sick just from walking the beat, they're getting sick
trump, Diseases are coming back that this world hasn't seen for 30, 40, 50 years
trump, It's a disgrace
trump, She ought to get back and take care of her district instead of wasting time on this nonsense
trump, We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life
trump, We believe that faith and family, not government bureaucracy are the true American way
trump, We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag
trump, And we live by the words of our national motto and it's always going to be up there
trump, They want to take everything down
trump, They don't want Thomas Jefferson anymore
trump, They don't want anything
trump, That's a terrible thing and we fight for it, now
trump, We fight
trump, These words will never be taken off
trump, I don't care where I am
trump, If I'm up there, if I'm down here, I don't know, but we'll be fighting
trump, We'll never take these words off, in God we trust
trump, We stand on the shoulders of generations of Michigan Patriots who gave their blood, sweat and tears for this beloved nation
trump, This is the state where Henry Ford invented the assembly line
trump, It's the place where General Motors, Chrysler and Kellogg transformed the nation
trump, It gave us Motown, the Mustang and the might of the American Midwest
trump, This is the American mid west
trump, And Michigan is the state where generations of strong, tough and proud American workers made this into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of the world
trump, And we are making it bigger, better and stronger than ever before, by far
trump, Loyal citizens like you help build this country
trump, And together, we are taking back our country
trump, We are returning power to you
trump, The American people, the Democrats took the people of Michigan for granted, but with us, you will never be forgotten again
trump, The forgotten men and women of this country will never, ever be forgotten again
trump, And I'm fighting for you
trump, And I love doing it with everything that I have
trump, And I will never, ever stop
trump, And you know that
trump, I will say I could have a much easier life
trump, Some people say, Why is he doing it You know why I'm doing it because we're doing the thing and look what we're doing is we're bringing back our country again
trump, We're respected again, we're respected again
trump, We are so respected, you don't even know how respected
trump, I went to NATO where we were being ripped off because the other countries, you have 29 countries, and the other countries weren't paying their bills
trump, They were delinquent in real estate
trump, I noticed people are using that word
trump, I've been using it for the last year
trump, It's like a real estate trend
trump, That's when they don't pay their rent, right Well, they weren't paying and you have to see this chart, until I got there
trump, They got to pay and they said, Well, does that mean you won't protect us I said, You don't want the answer to that question
trump, Over the last, and the Secretary General Stoltenberg, over the last period of just two years, I raised, not from us, nothing from us, 130 billion, but that's nothing and over a short period of time they will be paying 530 billion more
trump, All of those countries
trump, My biggest fan in the world is Secretary General Stoltenberg of NATO
trump, He says, I never thought this could
trump, I'm telling you, if you look, it's like 15 years just down
trump, President Obama would go there, make a speech, I'd like to thank everybody for being here
trump, Thanks
trump, Look, great job
trump, Sayonara
trump, Goodbye
trump, Bush, they all did
trump, Nobody ever asked for money
trump, We were spending for 100 of NATO
trump, We're protecting Europe
trump, They rip us off on trade, right They rip us off like crazy
trump, We lose hundreds of billions of dollars on trade
trump, We're changing that, but it's a long time
trump, It's been going on a long time
trump, They don't take your product
trump, They don't take your cars
trump, They don't take your farm product
trump, They don't take your medical machines
trump, We do a big business
trump, They sell us
trump, We don't sell them because they put restrictions
trump, We have better equipment than them, but they make it so that our equipment doesn't qualify
trump, It's called artificial barriers or non-monetary barriers
trump, It's brutal what they do
trump, I'm telling you, they're as bad as China, just smaller
trump, They are as bad as China, just smaller and now China's doing great
trump, We're very happy, but we have to do something with that
trump, We have to take care of our people
trump, We can't be ripped off by these countries, so NATO is ripping us off militarily, but now they're starting to pay big money and that's good
trump, We want to help them
trump, We want to be there with them, but they have to pay
trump, They have to pay
trump, 530 billion and the fake news doesn't even want to talk about it
trump, They don't want to talk about it
trump, They talk about other things
trump, They don't want to talk about that
trump, When you'd get a chance though, just a couple of weeks, maybe you could say over a short period of time, NATO countries will be paying 530 billion more
trump, More, not total
trump, More
trump, How's that Good
trump, That's not too bad
trump, Nobody else could do that, I guarantee
trump, I won't tell you what took place in those closed door meetings
trump, Some of them don't like me
trump, They like Obama
trump, Germany likes Obama
trump, A lot of these countries, France, they like Obama
trump, It's embarrassing
trump, In France, President Obama is more popular than President Trump
trump, Well, I should be
trump, I just taxed their wine and champagne coming into our country because they're ripping us off on the internet
trump, Okay
trump, If I ever become more popular, that means I'm not doing my job
trump, You should say he's out
trump, It's true
trump, I could be loved in Germany
trump, I could be loved in Germany
trump, Oh, they'd love me
trump, My father came from Germany, parents and I could be loved in Germany
trump, They'd like me so much, but then I'm not doing my job for you
trump, Have to do it
trump, Have to do it
trump, With your help, your devotion, your drive, we're going to keep on working
trump, We're going to keep on fighting
trump, We are going to keep on winning, winning, winning because we are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation, under God
trump, America is thriving like never before
trump, And ladies and gentlemen of Michigan, the best is yet to come
trump, Great state
trump, Great state
trump, You better remember all those jobs in a year from now, I tell you
trump, I'll say, That state let me down
trump, I don't think that's going to happen
trump, I'm hearing very good thing
trump, You know the interesting thing, before it was like a promise
trump, I said I'm going to bring car back
trump, I'm going to bring this
trump, I'm going to be pres, it was all like, it's good
trump, You believed me, I was successful, all this, but now we've done it
trump, We have done more than I promised, no politics
trump, I promised, we've done more than we promised
trump, No politician I think, has ever done that
trump, Together we will make America wealthy again
trump, We will make America strong again
trump, We will make America proud again
trump, We will make America safe again and we will make America great again
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you, Michigan
trump, Thank you
trump,
trump,There's a lot of people
trump, That's great
trump, Thank you very much
trump, Thank you very much
trump, That's a big group of people
trump, This is on fast notice, too
trump, Thank you
trump, But I'm thrilled to be here with the beautiful, great, hardworking people of this incredible state
trump, You're really hardworking American patriots
trump, That's what you are, and a lot of people haven't been treated right until I came along
trump, We've done a lot of work and a lot of good work, and you had your best year ever last year
trump, The state had the best year you've ever had
trump, 46 days from now, we're going to win Minnesota, and we're going to win four more years in the White House
trump, One of the most vital issues in this election is the subject of refugees
trump, You know it
trump, You know it perhaps better than almost anybody
trump, Lots of luck
trump, You're having a good time with the refugees
trump, That's good
trump, We want to have Omar
trump, He said Omar
trump, That's a beauty
trump, How the hell did she win the election How did she win It's unbelievable
trump, Every family in Minnesota needs to know about sleepy Joe Biden's extreme plan to flood your state with an influx of refugees from Somalia, from other places all over the planet
trump, Well, that's what's happened, and you like Omar a lot, don't you Biden has promised a 700 increase in the manifesto with Bernie, right A 700 increase in the importation of refugees from the most dangerous places in the world, including Yemen, Syria, and Somalia
trump, Congratulations, Minnesota
trump, A 700 increase
trump, Good luck, Minnesota
trump, Enjoy yourselves, because if I'm not here, if I don't win, I don't know where I'm going to be
trump, But maybe I'll come over to see Mike
trump, I'll come and see Mike
trump, Your state will be overrun and destroyed, and Biden and the radical Left win
trump, That's what's going to happen
trump, I've been watching it for years
trump, They haven't treated you right
trump, They have not treated Minnesota right
trump, Thank you
trump, I'll tell you, these hangers are great
trump, Remember this
trump, It's a friendly protest
trump, Please remember this is not a rally
trump, You're not allowed to have political rallies of any kind
trump, You're not allowed to go to church
trump, You're not allowed to do anything
trump, The only thing you're allowed to do is run wild through the streets, burn down storefronts, blow up stores, and kill people, because that's considered a protest, and that, they allow you to have
trump, You don't have to wear masks at protests
trump, So I said, We can't have a rally
trump, The most we can have is ten people
trump, But why don't we just call it a protest, because this is a protest
trump, It's a protest against stupidity
trump, Speaking about stupidity, sleepy Joe will turn Minnesota into a refugee camp
trump, Think of it
trump, 700 increase
trump, So you're not happy now Look at that guy over there
trump, He's not too thrilled when he hears this
trump, 700 increase is what they have in the manifesto
trump, Now, maybe they don't honor it, but I would say they'll go substantially higher than that number
trump, Biden will overwhelm your children's schools, overcrowd their classrooms, and inundate your hospitals
trump, That's what'll happen
trump, Biden has even pledged to terminate our travel ban to jihadist regions, jihadist regions
trump, They've already been doing that to you, haven't they Opening the flood gates to radical Islamic terrorists
trump, My administration's keeping terrorists, extremists, and criminals the hell out of our country
trump, We don't want them
trump, We don't want them
trump, We've got enough of them
trump, We've got enough of them
trump, Just today, we deported, as you know very well, dozens of Somali nationals charged or convicted with very grave crimes, including rape, assault, robbery, terrorism, and murder, of course
trump, These hardened criminals are back in their country, where they do all the complaining they want, and your children are much safer as a result
trump, Thank you, President Trump
trump, Thank you
trump, If it were up to Biden, and it's not
trump, It's the people that's around him
trump, They are seriously radical Left Democrats, and they're very dangerous
trump, The offenders are very dangerous, and they'd be running all over your state
trump, Only by voting for me are you going to say … But I hate to say this, and get it with your iron ore
trump, I did it with some other things, and I'll do it for you again
trump, I'll do it for you again
trump, But if you vote for me, I'm the difference, and I'm the wall
trump, You know the wall that we're building on the southern border I'm your wall between the American Dream and chaos
trump, Joe Biden is wholly owned and controlled by the left wing mob
trump, He has no clue where he is
trump, This is not a sharp guy
trump, Years ago, I said to a certain senator who I was very friendly with, a Democrat, Who's the dumbest senator Who's the smartest senator He gave me a name for the smartest
trump, I said, Who's the dumbest Oh, Joe Biden
trump, You didn't know that That was 25 years ago
trump, That was in prime time
trump, This is no longer prime time for sleepy Joe
trump, They do disinformation
trump, They make things up, and they make commercials
trump, They make things up
trump, I've never seen anything like it
trump, Everything, they make up
trump, First of all, I'm the one protecting your Social Security
trump, They say, Trump … Remember four years ago, they used to say, Oh, Trump will get rid of Social … I have protected your Social Security
trump, They're going to destroy your Social Security
trump, Remember Did you ever hear of a man, Fiorello La Guardia Did you ever I don't think that happened with him
trump, New York, I don't think it happened with Rudy Giuliani, did it What a great job Rudy did
trump, You realize Rudy's just now really being appreciated
trump, People forgot how good he was as a man
trump, He was a great mayor
trump, We polled it
trump, I'd go down about 22 points
trump, They want to poll everything nowadays
trump, I don't believe in polls
trump, They poll everything
trump, But Ali Velshi, I don't know anything about the guy, but I know he was standing there
trump, This is really quite a good scene
trump, It's a friendly protest
trump, Everyone's acting … and behind him, the entire city was burning
trump, It's one of the great pictures of all time
trump, The entire city was burning down
trump, That was your city, and it's a shame it took so long, but the governor finally did it at least
trump, If you take a look at Portland, the governor can't quite do it
trump, She can't get there
trump, I speak to her all the time
trump, Come on, Governor
trump, I can straighten out Portland
trump, Give me less than an hour
trump, Just let us have it for … because the state has to ask for it
trump, They have to request
trump, It's a shame
trump, It's such a shame
trump, But in your case, we went, and all of a sudden, it was really … That was going to be a bad night, too, right Remember that, about seven o'clock Then you see this guy walked out with about a 250,000 outfit on
trump, That's because it had more computers and this and that
trump, Got the tear gas deal
trump, He's got the whole deal, pepper spray, got everything, the finest outfit you can buy
trump, Believe me
trump, We just paid for them, and they were very expensive
trump, So we see one, the helmet
trump, How about the helmet with the goggles You can see at night
trump, You can see at day
trump, You can see whenever the hell you want
trump, So there's one
trump, I said, Oh, that's only one guy
trump, Then you see another three, then four
trump, Then you see another ten
trump, They were just getting out of the buses, coming from very friendly territory
trump, He got hit on the knee with a canister of tear gas, and he went down
trump, He was down
trump, My knee, my knee
trump, Nobody cared
trump, These guys didn't care
trump, They moved them aside, and they just walked right to … It was the most beautiful thing, and that would be it
trump, But so they had four or five lines
trump, Then they had lines of different … Everybody did the same thing
trump, Did they ever even move one step back I don't think so, right It was just a slow walk right forward
trump, Then they just started walking faster, faster, faster, put a lot of guys in jail, Tom, right Put a lot of guys … Great Congressman, by the way
trump, Put a lot of guys in jail
trump, Great
trump, Not good
trump, Great
trump, They put a lot of guys in jail that night, Tom, and that was the end of it
trump, I don't think he had any problem after that
trump, If you had any flare-ups, we'll send them in again
trump, But that's all you do
trump, These are Democrat-run disasters
trump, Look at Chicago
trump, Look at Portland
trump, Look at you with Minneapolis
trump, These are disasters
trump, By the way, are they still trying to get rid of your police force in Minneapolis That's what I heard
trump, See, they never learn
trump, They never learn
trump, They don't … You've got a lot of people here
trump, That's a lot of people
trump, I actually like these
trump, We have the arenas
trump, We've always filled them up
trump, It's been great, and the arenas are good, but usually you have to travel 45 minutes
trump, This thing, you have a hangar
trump, The plane becomes your backstop, right It's like your curtain
trump, It's a curtain
trump, You get a free curtain
trump, We're outside, which actually makes people happy
trump, It even makes the people that sometimes not everybody here likes happy, because outside is better
trump, It's better, and we're rounding the turn on COVID, by the way
trump, Our vaccines are coming
trump, A lot of things are happening
trump, We're rounding the turn
trump, We've done a great job
trump, We've done a phenomenal job
trump, We don't get credit for that, but we'll discuss that in a minute
trump, But when you look at it, when you look at it, our country is amazing
trump, It's an amazing country
trump, We love this country, and we're not going to let radical Left socialistcommunists take over our country
trump, Okay They use the word socialist, and socialists aren't great
trump, But communists are a hell of a lot worse, and that's where we'd be headed
trump, We're standing in the way of them, this group of people
trump, But you have a lot of groups of people just like this, every place we go
trump, Last night, you know where we were
trump, You saw that it was all over the place, right That's a big state
trump, That's a great state
trump, Then I see the fake polls
trump, I just saw a poll here, Minnesota
trump, I'm down nine
trump, I don't think so
trump, I mean, I just don't think so
trump, I don't think so, right I don't think so
trump, It's the craziest thing I've ever seen
trump, This is the craziest thing I've seen
trump, President Trump is down nine in Minnesota
trump, Now I just saw another plane
trump, See the plane The good thing about these beautiful Air Force Ones, right That's the smaller version of Air Force One
trump, I think you had a little bit short runway
trump, So they take the smaller to save about 12
trump, No, they took the smaller one
trump, But the great thing about those beautiful planes, they have more televisions than any plane in history
trump, We have televisions in the closet, on the ceilings, on the floors
trump, I've never seen them on the … We have them all over the place, and I'm just coming out
trump, They said, There he is
trump, They said, It's a smattering of people
trump, They called it a smattering
trump, They always do that
trump, Yet Biden with the circles, right The little circles
trump, He's got like four people in a circle
trump, You know why he does the circles Because he can't draw a crowd
trump, So they put a circle, like he's supposed to … He's trying to be legitimate
trump, He's going to go by the science
trump, He always says science
trump, He doesn't know what the word science is
trump, So to have these four or five circles, they put people, that way he doesn't have to be embarrassed when he goes to a high school gymnasium and he has 40, 50 people
trump, They had one not so long ago, and you saw this
trump, He couldn't draw a crowd
trump, It was a big thing
trump, It was his opening or something
trump, Couldn't draw a crowd
trump, So they made it a round table
trump, So he went in
trump, They only had like 32 people
trump, They said, This is very embarrassing, one of his people, and that's what they do
trump, They're good
trump, Some of the people surrounding him, they'll say anything and do anything
trump, They said, Let's not make it a speech
trump, There's nobody here
trump, Let's make it a round table
trump, So these people are sitting at a table
trump, They had no idea, and most of them didn't know anything about politics
trump, They didn't even know why they were there
trump, Now they're sitting on a round table, and they're on television
trump, But that's what it is
trump, But they say we had a smattering of people
trump, Yes, smattering of about what 15,000 people in about two days' notice
trump, This doesn't include the 10,000 people, Mike, that they turned away
trump, I hate that they turned them away
trump, You'd think with an airport, you wouldn't have to turn anybody away, but they have a certain amount
trump, Then sometimes you have Democrats running an airport, and they don't like all these people here
trump, That's true
trump, They don't like it
trump, But if we're up to Biden, your state would be in ruins
trump, Just take a look at what they've done, and I'm going to hit it hard
trump, They make phony commercials about me, and it gives me the right
trump, How about the worst one of all, the worst I've ever seen Standing on a grave of a fallen soldier, and then they had some guy, a source said … There's no source
trump, The source doesn't exist
trump, They make it up, and then they take it
trump, It's called disinformation
trump, You're not supposed to do that
trump, I'm not even sure if he knows
trump, He's too weak to understand, and he's still weak to control his people
trump, But it allows me to say whatever I want about this guy
trump, The truth is, he's not fit to be your President
trump, He's not mentally fit
trump, If Biden's elected, extremists, like representative Ilhan Omar … Whatever happened to her You had a great writer who has just made a living off writing about her
trump, She's done so many criminal acts
trump, Isn't it damn disgraceful that she gets away with it I have to say to myself, I say, How the hell did she get away with that If we do one … Look at General Flynn
trump, He didn't even lie
trump, They said he didn't lie, right He's gone through hell
trump, He's gone through hell
trump, This guy wrote page after page of criminal acts
trump, Well, let's see what happens
trump, Who the hell knows But between her and how about AOC AOC- AOC is running a campaign against the guy that was supposed to be speaker of the house
trump, Right Joe Crowley
trump, I knew him a little bit
trump, I asked him once I said, Are you campaigning against this maniac He said, No, she's just a young girl
trump, No problem
trump, I called him on election night
trump, Nah, I was going to, I was going to say, How did that work out, Joe That didn't work
trump, He was going to be Speaker Of The House
trump, He's got a certain talent
trump, But you know she had no money, nothing
trump, And all of a sudden she had 2,000,000 and she spent the 2,000,000 all over the place
trump, Her and her boyfriend
trump, Whatever happened to her Can you imagine if I'd do that You have to look at that
trump, She spent the 2,000,000 and big story
trump, But that was it
trump, That's one quick story
trump, Oh man
trump, Probably the guy who wrote the story, lost his job at the New York Times
trump, Right He's now unemployed, but there's a big story
trump, She spent 2,000,000 on bullshit
trump, If a Republican did that they'd be in jail
trump, You know that
trump, It's a different standard and it's a disgrace
trump, And our guys better get on the ball
trump, Look, let me tell you how about yesterday
trump, They were talking about Russia, Russia, Russia
trump, Again, here we go with the Russia
trump, There's never been anybody so tough on Russia with the sanctions
trump, Remember Obama would send pillows
trump, I sent tank busters right to Ukraine
trump, I'm the one that exposed the pipeline with Germany
trump, Germany pays them billions and billions of dollars
trump, And then we're supposed to protect Germany from Russia
trump, I said, How does that work How does that work You're spending billions of dollars for energy to Russia
trump, It's all okay
trump, I'm the one that exposed it
trump, What I've done … Hey, they don't want me to go
trump, But if you look, they don't want me to win
trump, Russia doesn't want … Maybe North Korea does because I actually have a very good relationship with him
trump, And speaking of North Korea and you know, it's okay to have really
trump, You don't have to go to wars
trump, We don't have to lose our great soldiers
trump, It's good
trump, If I got along with Putin
trump, Somebody said He gets along well with Putin
trump, I'm saying to myself, But isn't that sort of a good thing Is that bad
trump, He gets along with Putin
trump, That's a bad thing
trump, But you saw the head of the FBI yesterday started going Russia
trump, Russia is looking at our election
trump, Russia
trump, Here we go again
trump, Russia, Russia, Russia
trump, I said, What about China What about North Korea What about Iran What about …  They don't mention anybody else
trump, The narrative seems to be Russia
trump, Millions of phone calls made not one to Russia
trump, Millions of phone calls received not one to Russia
trump, Then he goes, Russia, Russia
trump, Then they asked him about Antifa
trump, What do you think about Antifa Well, it's an ideology
trump, I said, No, it's not
trump, It's a bunch of thugs and anarchists that are being funded by somebody and find out who the somebody is
trump, It's unbelievable
trump, Unbelievable when you look at this stuff
trump, But seriously, take a look at the AOC
trump, I call it AOC plus three
trump, Her three people that she tells what to do
trump, And 2,000,000
trump, Dresses, rent, other things
trump, You're not supposed to do that
trump, Mr
trump, Congressman, are you allowed to do that Sir You don't do that
trump, You don't buy dresses do you If he does that's the end of his career right No
trump, But it's terrible
trump, Right John It's terrible
trump, Will prosecute him
trump, I mean, why not I don't understand it
trump, I'll tell you what
trump, One friend of mine, very sophisticated guy, very successful guy called me up
trump, He says, You know
trump, From the day you came down the escalator with our great First Lady, our future First Lady
trump, He said From that day the people love her
trump, She gave a great speech at the Republican National Convention at The White House
trump, She gave a great speech
trump, But said From the day you came down the escalator with our First Lady
trump, From the single day you've been under investigation
trump, You've been under investigation by sleazebags
trump, People that now we caught, cleaned up their phones
trump, You're not allowed to do that
trump, Right Mr
trump,
trump, Congressman My great hockey player
trump, You're the greatest
trump, Right But you're not allowed to do that
trump, You know We want their phones
trump, Oh, here they are
trump, Oh, by the way, they happen to be totally deleted
trump, Like Hillary with the 33,000 emails she deleted
trump, If she is, she's not getting her money worth
trump, Her yoga lessons and her daughter's wedding
trump, Right So it was about the wedding and the yoga lessons
trump, So I said, Okay, let's give her five or six each
trump, What do you think, Mike Five or six each
trump, Five for the wedding
trump, Make it 30
trump, Make it a hundred
trump, Make it a thousand
trump, A thousand for the wedding
trump, And for the yoga, let's give her 200
trump, Okay
trump, What about all those thousands and thousands of emails
trump, Probably classified
trump, So Congress … So forget about it
trump, Let's assume they're gone because she deleted them and then she acid washed them
trump, And then she hit her phones with a hammer
trump, I get rid of phones
trump, I've never hit him with a hammer
trump, Not even as President
trump, I say, Yeah
trump, Throw the phone away
trump, No, no
trump, I've never hit a phone
trump, Has anybody ever gotten rid of your phone and taken a hammer and wiped the hell out of it I don't think so
trump, So she gets a subpoena from the U S Congress
trump, Not in a lawsuit against some guy that hates you and you're fighting and you're fighting or something
trump, By the way you do that, you've got problems in court, big problems
trump, But she gets a subpoena from Congress
trump, U
trump,S
trump, subpoena, the most important subpoena you can get
trump, They get the subpoena
trump, And after she gets the subpoena, by a few days everything is deleted
trump, Her phones are busted up and cleaned and wiped
trump, And everything's gone
trump, And nothing happens to her
trump, Forget about what was on
trump, Now think of how angry it makes me when I see it
trump, Now how angry Could you imagine if I'd do that it's a whole different ball game
trump, Know how angry it makes me when I see it
trump, And we had an attorney general that didn't have a clue
trump, That was my fault
trump, I was loyal to somebody
trump, Endorsed me early
trump, You know whey he endorsed me Because I went to Mobile, Alabama
trump, We had 55,000 people show up at a stadium
trump, He said, I'd like to endorse you
trump, Then after we won, he said, I'd love to be attorney general
trump, And I said, No, I don't think so
trump, But after four or five times asking, I'm a loyal person and I did it
trump, The mistakes sometimes you make is because of loyalty, but that's okay
trump, But allowed her to get away with that is a disgrace
trump, Maybe there's something they can do
trump, So forget about looking for the emails
trump, And they are available
trump, And I guarantee they're in the State Department
trump, I guarantee you they're in the state department that ought to damn well find them
trump, They're being protected in the State Department
trump, But forget about that
trump, Almost as good is the fact that you're not allowed to do what she did and her lawyers should pay, Kendall should pay, equal consequence
trump, Equal consequence
trump, Equal
trump, But that's the way it is
trump, But we are making a lot of progress if you see what's going on
trump, I said to myself, I'm going to stay uninvolved
trump, I don't have to
trump, Chief Law Enforcement Officer, can you believe it But I think it's better if I stay uninvolved
trump, And I have stayed uninvolved and we do have an excellent Attorney General
trump, Bill Barr
trump, And I'll be honest, he's a smart guy
trump, I think he's getting tougher and tougher and tougher every day
trump, I think he's not going to put up with this stuff
trump, I don't think
trump, And you know he's got a lot of people that are deep staters, whatever you want to call them
trump, They fight him at every turn
trump, They fight him, fight him, fight him
trump, But he's getting tougher and tougher
trump, I watched over the last three days, I'm saying, Wow, that's sort of what we're all waiting for
trump, Right But she deletes her emails
trump, AOC gets rid of 2,000, 000
trump, Gets rid of it
trump, Nothing happens
trump, Nothing happens
trump, And then she goes around and calls us all like what the hell are we And she controls Nancy Pelosi
trump, Actually Nancy Pelosi would love to get rid of her I think
trump, How about Pelosi Pelosi goes out and says, You know
trump, I think I have my hair done
trump, So she goes out and she goes into this beauty parlor
trump, I told the story in Wisconsin last night
trump, By the way, we had that great crowd in Wisconsin
trump, You have a feeling about places
trump, You know the problem with Minnesota is that I think since 1972, this hasn't been won by a Republican
trump, So, you're a little behind the eight ball when you hear that
trump, Right I mean, I can understand
trump, And Wisconsin rarely
trump, But I won Wisconsin
trump, Unlike Minnesota thank you very much
trump, Thank you very much, Tom
trump, Thank you
trump, Unlike Minnesota
trump, But it's my fault
trump, So I had one speech left
trump, It started at one in the morning
trump, I went to Michigan, we won Michigan
trump, That was another one
trump, Great state
trump, We brought back so many auto companies into Michigan
trump, We brought them back
trump, But I had one
trump, It was already voting day
trump, It was election day
trump, Because by the time I got there it was just scheduled
trump, Had I made that one damn stop to your state we would have won Minnesota
trump, I lost by what A half a point
trump, Half a point
trump, But I get off the plane and they said, He's in Minnesota
trump, He's down nine
trump, The recent poll
trump, Down nine
trump, I believe it's a suppression poll
trump, And you know, I have an instinct about things pretty much
trump, Somebody said Trump has the greatest political instincts of the last 100 years
trump, One of my enemies said that
trump, And I said, No, I don't
trump, I don't believe I do
trump, I think I have lousy political instincts
trump, But what am I going to tell you Let me just say they said that
trump, And I was very impressed by the statement
trump, In fact, I went to my wife I said, You know, they say I have the greatest political instincts in over a hundred years
trump, And I said, But I don't believe it
trump, I don't
trump, I don't want to be Beto
trump, Remember Beto I was born to run for president
trump, That was the end of his career
trump, Beto O'Rourke who's in charge of guns
trump, By the way, he's going to take your guns away
trump, You know that, right Biden
trump, Sleepy Joe
trump, Sleepy Joe is going to take your guns away
trump, Remember Beto on the cover of a really crummy magazine
trump, I won't mention the name
trump, They've got a lot of bad magazines out there
trump, The good news is most of them are dying
trump, If not all of them
trump, But Beto O'Rourke, he did the story and he was going to defeat Ted Cruz
trump, He was going to do all these things
trump, Ted beat him
trump, And I helped a lot too
trump, I was with Ted all the way
trump, And I think Ted's appreciated it
trump, But I even said, I'm putting Ted Cruz as one of the people for the Supreme Court
trump, Right And you know why I did it You know why I did it Because I wanted to make sure that I had somebody on a list we had about 45 unbelievable people, unbelievable
trump, The smartest, the best
trump, The absolute creme de la creme, right The best minds in the country
trump, Conservative
trump, They believe in the constitution
trump, Little things like that
trump, But I said, You know
trump, I have to have somebody that we're going to make sure we get approved
trump, And the only one I could think of is Ted, because he's going to get 50 Republican votes and he's going to get 50 Democrat votes
trump, They'll do anything to get them out of the Senate
trump, Right So anyway, but just to finish, there's no way that I'm nine points down
trump, I look at a crowd
trump, So they say instinct, right So I look at a crowd and whether I have good instinct or not, this is not the crowd of somebody that's going to finish second in the state to a Sleepy Joe
trump, Finish second to a guy that cannot put two sentences together
trump, Now it is an ideology
trump, It doesn't matter
trump, I could put that broken piece of wood right there
trump, I could put that out
trump, And it's the same thing as Joe
trump, It's just an ideology
trump, It's just an idea
trump, Now, historically, we have the biggest gap in enthusiasm of any campaign that they've ever opposed
trump, You heard that
trump, Like 36 points
trump, In other words, they've got no enthusiasm for him
trump, I have tremendous enthusiasm as we can tell
trump, But he does have enthusiasm to beat Trump
trump, His only enthusiasm is put anybody in there
trump, Right Put anybody in there
trump, He does have enthusiasm to beat Trump
trump, Nothing for him, but to beat Trump
trump, Okay
trump, But historically that never wins
trump, When somebody has to rely on winning because of somebody as opposed to winning because people love you, people respect you … And Sean Hannity did something the other night
trump, He said to this man, If you owned a McDonald's hamburger stand in a reasonably busy area, would you have Joe Biden running that stand The answer is no
trump, He doesn't have the energy
trump, He doesn't
trump, So he can't run the country
trump, No, seriously
trump, I thought it was good
trump, I never thought of it
trump, You wouldn't have him running your business
trump, You wouldn't have him running a McDonald's
trump, I have to say or a Wendy's
trump, I have a friend he owns Wendy's
trump, He always gets up
trump, Ken, you haven't mentioned Wendy's Okay
trump, But you know you wouldn't do it because he couldn't do it
trump, And yet he's running for the presidency
trump, He's got no energy
trump, I made a comment that somebody had low energy
trump, That was the end of his political career
trump, But Joe's energy is far lower
trump, It's far lower
trump, No, it's far lower than Jeb
trump, Jeb was on the low side
trump, But Joe, he's off the scale
trump, Right Joe's got nothing going
trump, Today Biden delivered remarks, barely, to a union after spending 47 years giving their jobs to China and foreign countries in exchange for campaign cash
trump, How about his statement Hey, we talk about AOC being crooked
trump, She's a hundred percent crooked
trump, Okay
trump, But were talking about that
trump, Look at Omar
trump, She came in here
trump, Did she marry her brother Where's that writer That writer should be given the Pulitzer prize
trump, He never will be
trump, He should be though
trump, You know the amazing thing, all of these writers, New York Times, Washington Post, right Russia, Russia, Russia
trump, Trump
trump, Russia, Russia, Russia
trump, I had 19 people
trump, All brilliant
trump, All radical left
trump, All Hillary people
trump, Actually not even a never Trumper from Bush
trump, Okay
trump, All Hillary Clinton people mostly, almost everyone
trump, They were all Democrats
trump, How about this You're being investigated by 19 Democrats that are smart people
trump, Okay Smart people
trump, So my friend says, You know, you are the most honest person in the world
trump, And you've taken three years of total investigation
trump, You don't think they've gone over my taxes
trump, They went over at the biggest tax firm in the country
trump, The most prestigious
trump, They went over everything
trump, They spend 48 million as it comes out now
trump, It's about 48,000,000 investigating me before I won and after I won
trump, And we caught them spying on my campaign
trump, That's what they were really doing
trump, And now with the phones, I think there's like 22 or 24 people
trump, You heard this one They said, No, no, no
trump, We made a mistake when we deleted our phone
trump, You know what they had to do to make that mistake Like 19 different formulas
trump, Right I don't even know how you delete a phone
trump, I didn't know you could do it
trump, But they all made the exact same mistake
trump, That's not good
trump, That's not good
trump, So let's see what happens to them
trump, It's a criminal act you know that, right It's a criminal act
trump, It's criminal
trump, Weissman's a bad guy
trump, Put a lot of people in jail that shouldn't be in jail, Weissman
trump, He's a bad guy
trump, He's on CNN all the time or MSNBC which I call it MSDNC
trump, Because it's the same thing
trump, Owned by a company called Concast
trump, Did anyone ever hear … With an N, not an M
trump, Con like a con job
trump, Concast
trump, They a fortune on public relations
trump, Comcast has delivered you the news, all the news
trump, And they spend a fortune
trump, And then I go up and make one speech and I call them Concast And that's the end of the PR for the year
trump, They are a bad group of people
trump, They're sick
trump, I mean, they're sick people
trump, They're sick and evil people and they want bad things for our country and they don't report the news
trump, You know, in the old days, when you used public airways free, you had to get a license
trump, I keep saying, If they're reporting fake news, how come they can keep getting a license Whether it's ABC, whether it's NBC, CBS, or of course, CNN
trump, Which is I mean one of the great jokes of all time, CNN
trump, Or MSDNC
trump, But they're cable so I guess there's a different standard
trump, But when you're using the public airwaves free
trump, Okay Free
trump, Aren't you supposed to get licensed So I asked my people that
trump, I ask a couple of guys and I never really get an answer
trump, I just want to know a simple question
trump, Do you have to report the truth when you using free airwaves and making a fortune with commercials and everything else
trump, And I never get the right answer because there are people down deep
trump, It's crazy
trump, But we're getting down to all of it
trump, A lot of progress has been made
trump, I think you're starting to see it
trump, We're trying to beat a terrible group of deep state people
trump, You know I came to Washington … Think of it, think of it
trump, I came to Washington and I had 24 years of putting people in office
trump, And then you can probably add another four to that
trump, And another four to that
trump, I had many, many years, decades of people putting … So I came
trump, Been to Washington I guess 17 times I never stayed over
trump, Right Never slept over
trump, I was there 17 times
trump, But we're riding down the beautiful Pennsylvania Avenue
trump, And I look outside at those police
trump, I love our police
trump, We've got to treat our police better
trump, I had everything
trump, I had police
trump, I had military
trump, I had soldiers
trump, I had everything you could possibly have
trump, You never saw so much how power and strength and beauty
trump, The beauty
trump, And they were so proud
trump, They're all saluting, they're so proud
trump, They're happy to have gotten rid of that crowd that was there before us
trump, They're proud
trump, They're great
trump, The police
trump, You know, every single police force I think endorsed me
trump, I got the one yesterday from Chicago
trump, That's not easy
trump, Chicago endorsed me
trump, New York's finest endorsed me
trump, Florida
trump, Ohio
trump, I mean, everybody
trump, I don't know that he's gotten one vote
trump, Then he says he can't mention the words law and order
trump, Can you believe it And then I get to the most beautiful house in the world
trump, I can have Mar-a-Largo and all of them
trump, But I'll tell you The White House is still The White House, no matter how you do it
trump, And I get to this gorgeous, beautiful place
trump, And I'm up at the incredible suite level and there's Abraham Lincoln's suite
trump, It's called the Lincoln bedroom
trump, Remember Clinton used to lease it out to people for money
trump, They never change do they
trump, Remember when Barbara Streisand, she's another beauty, by the way
trump, But remember Barbara Streisand used to stay in that suite Which was the only problem I had with it
trump, But tell me … No, but I do like her voice
trump, I do
trump, I really do
trump, Some of them I don't like even their voices
trump, But she used to stay there
trump, And I'm standing in the Lincoln bedroom
trump, The history of the whole thing
trump, The bed, the desk, the Gettysburg address, the beautiful four score and seven years ago
trump, This beautiful Gettysburg address
trump, He wrote it there
trump, And also on his carriage ride up to Gettysburg
trump, He delivered the Gettysburg address and they say the only one that got worse press than I did was Abraham Lincoln
trump, Did anyone ever hear that And I said, No way they got worse
trump, Maybe he got bad
trump, But no way he gets worse
trump, Now people are starting to say, It's probably true
trump, I think you've got the worst
trump, Now they used to say, No, no
trump, Newt Gingrich, great guy
trump, He said, Nope, Abraham Lincoln got the worst press
trump, They were worse to him than anybody
trump, He was a very depressed person
trump, His wife was very depressed
trump, It was a depressed kind of a thing
trump, He's in a war, he's in a revolution
trump, And he was getting beaten a lot by Robert E
trump, Lee
trump, They want to rip his statue down all over the place
trump, But Robert E
trump, Lee whether you like statues or not, they don't rip statues down anymore
trump, I signed a law
trump, 10 years in jail if they rip them down
trump, But Robert E
trump, Lee won many, many battles in a row and it was supposed to be over in one day
trump, It was supposed to end immediately because the North was too powerful for the South
trump, But it just shows when you have leaders, when you have a great general
trump, And Robert E
trump, Lee, he would have won except for Gettysburg
trump, And that was because his general was killed who's going to lead Gettysburg
trump, Never fight uphill, me boys
trump, Never fight uphill
trump, He heard they were going up hill
trump, Stop them, stop them
trump, But we had no cell phones in that day, right Congressmen No cell phones
trump, So they sent the horses to stop him
trump, Stop him
trump, But it was too late
trump, They fought uphill and they got slaughtered
trump, That's what happened
trump, But Robert E
trump, Lee these were incredible things
trump, But I hope you appreciate that we had a period of time when they were ripping down all of the statues and monuments
trump, And I said to my people four months ago, I said, This is crazy
trump, These people
trump, And they don't even know
trump, They started ripping down Abraham Lincoln
trump, When they hit Lincoln I said, Wait a minute
trump, This is the man
trump, And you can't do … Then they hit George Washington, Thomas Jefferson
trump, They hit everybody
trump, They even had Gandhi
trump, All Gandhi wanted was one thing
trump, Peace
trump, May we have peace
trump, Rip down the statue we don't like it
trump, I don't think they have any idea what they're doing
trump, I think they're just a bunch of thugs
trump, Okay You want to know that I think they are a bunch of thugs
trump, They were going to March on Washington and they were going to rip down a statue of Abraham Lincoln
trump, You know the exact statute
trump, Its up very nicely
trump, Up now
trump, And by the way, they can take them down legally
trump, They go through Congress as a way of doing it
trump, But they didn't want to do it that way
trump, And they were marching on Washington
trump, And I said, Do we have any laws about this They said, No, sir
trump, Now in Congress, the way it is now, the most you get is about a 10 fine
trump, You rip down a 5 million statue and you got a 10 fine
trump, Right It's different world
trump, That's when it was strong and they had laws
trump, But we told and found this old act
trump, And the old act said, if you rip down a monument or a statue, you get 10 years in prison
trump, They call it prison, not jail, which sounds even worse
trump, I said, Bring that sucker up immediately to the Oval Office because there are a lot of people coming to Washington
trump, They were going to March on the Jefferson Memorial
trump, Do you believe that The Jefferson Memorial
trump, We grow up … The Jefferson Memorial
trump, They were going to March on the Jefferson Memorial
trump, They were going to do damage to our beautiful Jefferson Memorial after Thomas Jefferson
trump, And I did predict that
trump, A friend of mine said, You know, two years ago you said, next will be Robert E
trump, Lee and then comes Washington
trump, And Jefferson and Lincoln
trump, They'd never stop
trump, The only thing they understand is strength
trump, Remember that
trump, They don't understand weakness
trump, There's nothing you can do
trump, These really stupid heads of these corporations that give hundreds of millions of dollars
trump, It's like blackmail money, right But these stupid people that run, they get 40,000,000 a year and they're weak
trump, Okay, they're weak
trump, But these people, they're anarchists and the only thing they understand is strength
trump, So I said, Let me see this document
trump, I said, Wow, this is a very strong document
trump, And Derek is here
trump, One of my attorneys, he did a great job
trump, I don't know where the hell Derek is
trump, He's around here
trump, Actually he's heard this before though
trump, Not quite
trump, You're getting a very unique speech tonight
trump, You know I mean unlike Joe, I haven't even looked at the teleprompter
trump, This guy will Move it up
trump, Move it up
trump, I can't see
trump, Move it up
trump, I haven't looked at it
trump, The poor teleprompter guy he's sitting there What do we do We're on line two of the teleprompter
trump, He said, What do we do No, unlike Joe, I have not looked at the teleprompter
trump, Oh, that poor Joe
trump, You know what's the worst part about him looking at the teleprompter The worst part is that means that the fake news media is giving him the questions
trump, Right Like Donna Brazil, who was brilliantly hired by Fox
trump, Fox has changed a little bit
trump, Ladies and gentlemen, Donna Brazil, who was fired by CNN because she cheated and she gave crooked Hillary the questions to the debate
trump, How would you like to be me They give her questions to the debate
trump, And I still won the debate and she had all the questions
trump, Think of it
trump, How do you do that Donna Brazil is, ladies and gentlemen, she's going to work for Fox
trump, Oh, that's great
trump, That's big difference
trump, Big difference between four years ago and now
trump, A lot of things have changed
trump, But I'll tell you what's changed is the fact that we have more enthusiasm now than we did four years ago
trump, It's amazing right But just to get back to the others
trump, So I signed that wonderful executive order instituting this really tough law
trump, And it says 10 years
trump, It doesn't say, you get 10 years, but you can take it down to three weeks
trump, It says 10 years
trump, So these guys had just gotten there
trump, I had a news conference because I had to let them know about it
trump, Right We've got many people in jail right now from before nobody even talked about taking statues down
trump, No, but I looked at the Andrew Jackson right With the ropes
trump, And I'll tell you, the police did a great job
trump, And Mark Meadows did a great job
trump, He said, Charge
trump, They charged
trump, And they took these guys out and they were fairly tough
trump, But the police were much tougher
trump, DC police
trump, They did a great job
trump, They were watching and they weren't able to do anything
trump, Mark Meadows said Charge
trump, It was like from 200 years ago it was crazy
trump, They charged and they'd beat the hell out of these guys
trump, Or you wouldn't have that great statue on the horse of a great general
trump, He was a great general
trump, And he was a very good president
trump, At least a good president
trump, But he was a great general
trump, The battle of New Orleans
trump, Right He went to jail too
trump, We had all the evidence we needed
trump, Thank you for that
trump, I want to thank you fake news
trump, We called the fake news
trump, We said Can we just have that please When they said, no, we just said, We'll take it off TiVo
trump, That's okay
trump, Don't worry about it
trump, One of the greatest inventions in history
trump, Tivo better than television because television is useless without it
trump, So, we signed it
trump, And all of a sudden these same guys who were watching it, they left
trump, Nobody showed up the next day
trump, They're going to have 25,000 people
trump, They had 24 people, 5 of them were brought to prison
trump, Okay
trump, And the next day they said, Well, we were going to save it for Saturday night
trump, And Saturday night nobody showed up
trump, And nobody has showed up in four months to take down a statue
trump, It's true
trump, Because you know why They look and they say, I want to take down that statue
trump, I'm going to take down that statue
trump, That statue's coming down
trump, And then somebody says, You know it's 10 years in jail
trump, They go, That's too much
trump, I'm getting out of here
trump, It's true
trump, Ten years is not acceptable, Mike
trump, Right Ten years is a lot to rip down a statue, have a little fun, especially when they have no idea what they're ripping down
trump, But we have an idea what they're ripping down
trump, They're ripping down in many cases, greatness
trump, They're ripping down our past
trump, They're ripping down our history
trump, And that's where these guys begin
trump, They take away your history
trump, You look at the Middle East, you look all over
trump, Look what ISIS did
trump, Look what all of them do
trump, They go down and they rip
trump, They go into museums and they break everything and they rip everything
trump, They want to take away your past
trump, They're not taking away the past of the United States of America
trump, Not as long as I'm here
trump, What do you want Do you want me to go back on teleprompter anybody Okay
trump, Here's the question
trump, My poor guy must be having a fit
trump, He's over there
trump, He's so good at this stuff
trump, He's on line three
trump, … Good at this stuff
trump, He's on line three
trump, He said, Sir, should I use turn the sucker off Would you rather go teleprompter or freelance Isn't it nice when you have the option because you have this and you have the option to go either See, Joe doesn't have the option
trump, He doesn't have the option
trump, But if Biden wins, China wins, and it's very simple
trump, It's very simple
trump, By contrast, I rescued the Minnesota Iron Range, I did that
trump, Just so you know, O-Biden
trump, I call him O-Biden, it's too long to say Obama and Biden, so I just go, O-Biden, because I don't care about… Everyone said, Oh no, he's in trouble
trump, Obama's now campaigning
trump, Hey, he campaigned last time harder than Hillary
trump, I said, No, I want him to campaign because he brings out the base
trump, He brings out our base
trump, And I'm only here because of him and Joe
trump, I'm only here because of him
trump, I could right now be having a very beautiful life of luxury, and here I am at the hangar in Minnesota with 15 or 20 or 25,000 people
trump, And thousands of people that couldn't get in, and I'm working my ass off
trump, I could be at home having a good time, wonderful time
trump, But the one thing I said is- We want trump
trump, We want Trump
trump, We want Trump
trump, But I say this
trump, I say this look, I could be home
trump, So home was New York
trump, I had to bail out because it was too crazy, everything has fallen apart
trump, But home, it's so sad what the democrats have done to our great New York
trump, Between a governor and a mayor, the crime is through the roof, the corruption is incredible, it's a sad thing that's happened to New York
trump, Hopefully it'll come back by somebody
trump, Somebody will go in there and do like a Rudy
trump, You know when Rudy took over, it was so bad and they were looking for somebody and they thought he was the guy because he was a tough guy
trump, But somebody has to go in and clean it up
trump, This mayor, he let go of a billion dollars worth of police
trump, He actually believed the nonsense about defunding the police
trump, And they're all going to do it
trump, They're all going to do it
trump, And New York people are going to do it
trump, I'm being totally serious now
trump, You've got to go out and you've got to vote for Trump
trump, You got to break this spell from 1972
trump, You saw Kenosha
trump, What we did for other places, you saw the Kenosha, and that was gone
trump, That was all gone
trump, That place was gone
trump, We sent in the troops, it was incredible what we did, and they did it on day three
trump, Day three is better than two weeks later, like in Minneapolis
trump, But they did it, and we've done a great job and the people of that great state, they understand it, and I just hope the people of your state of Minnesota understand it because we don't have too many more chances with this stuff
trump, We really don't
trump, We don't have the luxury of sitting back and saying, Let's have four years of this maniac, vice president that he picked who treated him worse than any other person
trump, That's why I say the one person that he won't pick… My great instincts, right The one person he won't pick is Kamala because she called him a racist, she tried to me-too him
trump, He was me-too'd
trump, I've just been me-too'd Darling, what does that mean But they tried to me-too him
trump, And she was the one that brought it up
trump, Remember Tara She was the one that brought it up, and then he goes, Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to pick… Wait a minute, let me get her name here
trump, How do you pronounce it It's with a comma, like a comma, right Like a comma
trump, Remember he couldn't pronounce her name He was saying her name wrong, and she had to interrupt him
trump, No, my name is Kamala
trump, Like comma
trump, I remember that
trump, Like a comma
trump, H1N1, that's right, Joe
trump, Remember that Joe, H1N1
trump, And how bad did he do in that though How about that How bad did he do So come to think of it, he's out there now today
trump, It was pathetic
trump, By the way, did you see the Anderson Cooper thing last night You have to watch
trump, I don't want to watch, but I have an obligation
trump, I'm competing against somebody
trump, You don't want to compete and say, I'm not going to watch my competition, who wouldn't It's boring, but I got to watch
trump, And he got through it
trump, He met a couple of really… The chicken thing was bad
trump, He said chicken many, many times, and it was a little strange that I thought it was over and he pulled it back
trump, He was able to pull it back
trump, But Anderson is a… And he interviewed me, he's tough
trump, You know, he can be tough, nothing against him
trump, He could be very tough, but last night he was in rare form
trump, He was, Thank you very much for being here, Mr
trump, Vice President, are you enjoying the run And compare that with my shot, where they asked me about doing ABC with George Stephanopoulos
trump, I think it was great
trump, I think it worked out great
trump, You know what I call it Debate prep
trump, I call that free debate prep
trump, But you know it's nasty, it's a little nasty that people… and I didn't say, No, you got to change the rules
trump, No, give me the questions
trump, I want to use a teleprompter to answer
trump, How about that though Mr
trump, Vice President, I'd like to know your feeling on nuclear warfare and how does that relate to China and Russia and where are they in the race Well, you can't have this as your president
trump, I don't care
trump, Forget about me
trump, You can't do this
trump, The importance and the power of this position are too great
trump, You can't do it
trump, I've learned a lot as president
trump, But one thing I learned is that President Xi of China is sharp
trump, You ever see him standing with the two million men walking in front, everybody's the same height, they're wearing hats, everyone's like a pool table, right And he's standing there by himself, and he's looking like he's not playing games
trump, There's no games, he's sharp as you can be
trump, And I had a great relationship, but now I feel differently
trump, We made a great trade deal, and now I feel differently
trump, But he's a sharp as you can be
trump, Putin as sharp as you can be
trump, Kim Jong Un, we would have been in a war with North Korea 100
trump, I asked Obama, Did you ever call him He said that was the toughest problem we had
trump, And we get along
trump, Remember about a month ago, two months ago, they broke into the demilitarized zone and they said, Oh, he's going to attack
trump, I said, No, he's not
trump, Don't worry about it
trump, I got to know him very well
trump, We have a good relationship
trump, People said, He has a good relationship with Kim Jong Un, that's terrible
trump, I said, No, that's good
trump, But you remember it was going to be a nuclear war, and I got along with him
trump, Then they said, Trump made a terrible deal
trump, He's given so much to North Korea
trump, What did I give I was at like a semi debate with his idiot, a reporter
trump, He's given a lot to North Korea
trump, What did I give I don't know
trump, Sanctions, sanctions
trump, You took away
trump, No, I didn't
trump, Actually, I increased the sanctions very substantially
trump, What did you give What did I give Tell me
trump, So after about four days they couldn't ask because I gave nothing except I gave heart because I don't want to see people killed on their side either
trump, I don't want to see people killed
trump, We'd win that
trump, We'd win them all
trump, We have the greatest weapons right now ever conceived by man
trump, We've rebuilt our military to a level that nobody ever thought possible
trump, And then the fake news
trump, And I said that a couple of weeks ago, remember I said, We have created the most powerful weapons known to man
trump, It's true
trump, We have weapons that are so advanced that President Xi, Putin, everybody, we're the envy of the world
trump, But they don't know quite what we have, but they know we have stuff that they never even heard of before
trump, And some schmuck back there said, I think he's given away classified information
trump, Now, all I'm doing is telling the world, we have the most powerful weapons in the world
trump, I'm not even saying what kind
trump, You don't even want to know about it
trump, And God help us if we ever have to use them
trump, But we have the most powerful weapons ever conceived by man
trump, They have the missile, the super-duper, hydro sonic, I call it the super-duper, it goes five times faster than a normal missile, right We have one goes much faster than that
trump, But Russia got that information from the Obama administration
trump, Russia stole that information
trump, You knew that
trump, Russia got the information and they built it
trump, But we have now one that's much faster than that
trump, That's like a slow missile
trump, That's like considered a slow missile
trump, But I said it was incredible
trump, Two weeks ago I said, We have the finest, the best, the most incredible, sadly, the most deadly, and we never want to use it, but we have the greatest weapons ever in history by a factor of 10, by a factor of 10
trump, And they went crazy
trump, He's given away classified
trump, These people are sick
trump, All I'm doing is saying that we rebuilt our military 2
trump,5 trillion all built in the USA, every single ounce of it
trump, We have fighter jet, F-35 that are so good, you can't see it
trump, And I went to see the program, and I met some of the pilots and these guys are better looking than Tom Cruise
trump, They're tougher
trump, They're stronger
trump, They're bigger
trump, They're more powerful
trump, They're smarter
trump, And I like Tom cruise by the way, because you can't get much better than Top Gun, right Great movie
trump, You can't get better
trump, I like Tom cruise
trump, But these guys are better looking than Tom
trump, They got that crew cut, they got the crap under their eyes, they got the whole deal
trump, They're smart as hell
trump, So I said, So captain, let me ask you, how good is the F-35 They're really good Sir, best plane we've ever had all great
trump, I said, How do you compare that with what Russia has Well, ours is better for a specific reason, Sir
trump, You can't see it
trump, What does that mean Well, when we fight, they cannot see us, that we are so stealth
trump, Now that doesn't mean in three years that it won't be obsolete because that's what happens
trump, That's the problem with that business
trump, You come up with a new computer and two weeks later it's obsolete
trump, That's why I always like real estate, and grab a piece of real estate
trump, But no, it's true
trump, I wouldn't be good in that business
trump, You get to work, work, work, and then you're starting the next one because the last one is gone
trump, That's why I always talk about walls and wheels
trump, When the Democrats were saying, Walls are old fashioned
trump, Well, they're right about that
trump, But they work
trump, Remember that All we had to go through in Congress And that wall is going up, think of that
trump, We're building 10 miles a week, 10 miles a week of the top
trump, And our numbers on the border are the best they've ever been
trump, The best they've ever been
trump, Well, we're building 10 miles of wall a week
trump, We're up to about 330 miles, and we'll have it finished very soon, and it's having a tremendous impact on drugs
trump, It's having a tremendous impact on all of the different things
trump, Human trafficking in women
trump, It's not even children
trump, They're trafficking women, it's because of the internet
trump, You think of that as almost an ancient kind of a crime, right But it's not
trump, It's a very modern crime and it's an unbelievably profitable crime
trump, They're trafficking women, little bit children, but mostly women
trump, Where they'll put three or four women in the back in the trunk of a car and they'll go through the border
trump, They can't do it anymore
trump, And we're catching them
trump, We have people that do nothing but look for the traffickers
trump, To me, the traffickers are the biggest scum of the world
trump, And thank heavens for ICE, and thank heavens for border patrol because these people do a job that you don't want
trump, I know Mike doesn't want it
trump, You wouldn't even be good at it, Mike, he'll do a commercial about it
trump, That's what he'll do
trump, Does he have the longest commercials in history I say, Mike Lindell
trump, I say, Mike, the pillow man
trump, I say, Mike is the single greatest purchaser of commercials in history
trump, I want him to buy my commercials
trump, I say, You know, we spent 20 million, I sell like two commercials
trump, He spends 2 and he's got the whole day on Fox
trump, I said, let Mike buy our commercials
trump, Will you I don't know what the hell you do, but whatever it is, you better tell me the secret
trump, Greatest purchaser of commercials
trump, But we have done some job with that
trump, And the traffickers and drugs are way down
trump, Now we got upset with the pandemic, but I watched Biden today talking about, If only Trump moved one week sooner
trump, One week
trump, So let's go, ready So, you know he was against the ban, right Because he didn't think we had a problem
trump, So he was against the ban
trump, He didn't know that China was heavily infected
trump, He doesn't even know where China is, in my opinion
trump, But he was against the ban
trump, These guys write stuff out for him, and he tries to read it
trump, Doesn't do well with it
trump, So he was against it, but now his new thing is, if only I moved one week earlier, but I was earlier than everybody
trump, If you think about it
trump, I had nice guy, Dr
trump, Fauci, I had another nice, got a lot of doctors
trump, They were all telling me, No, no, you don't have to do that
trump, Tom knows that very well
trump, You don't have to do that, Sir
trump, You don't have to do that
trump, You don't have to do that at all
trump, And one of those things, I was very early and I banned and everybody admits that had I not banned highly infected Wuhan province, right Highly infected, we would have had hundreds of thousands of more deaths
trump, And then you had the chart
trump, I put it up yesterday, I'm doing these news conferences
trump, We're finally getting the word across that we did a great job, but I'm doing news conferences now every day
trump, I call them the highly rated news conferences
trump, And I go before these crazy people, they're screaming like maniacs
trump, It's not the way they treat Sleepy Joe
trump, He'd melt
trump, If they ever did a number on, this guy would be there he'd be laying on the floor crying, Get me out of here, Darling
trump, Where is my wife Get me out of here, please, Darling
trump, They're so nasty to me today
trump, What happened We go through it every single day
trump, But you think about it, and he said, If only Trump moved faster, but he's the one that two months later called me xenophobic, and he called me a racist because I was banning China, which was heavily infected
trump, And then he said, Don't ban Europe
trump, Well, I looked at Italy, big problem
trump, I love Italy
trump, I love the people of Italy, but they were heavily infected
trump, France, I looked at France, I looked at Spain, they even had spikes recently
trump, Did you see And we're doing great
trump, We're rounding it with or without, but we're going to have with, but you know, with his better, but with or without, we're rounding that corner, and we're rounding it fast and they don't want to give us any credit because they want to keep this up 'til November 4th
trump, And on November 4th, the press will probably say, let's say something stupid happened
trump, The press will say, I got to admit he did a damn good job
trump, And the other clown will be in office
trump, We did a thing called price transparency
trump, I signed it
trump, It's effective, also very complicated
trump, It's on your medical
trump, And we did price transparency
trump, It's the biggest thing
trump, It's bigger than healthcare
trump, Where you see your prices
trump, You can go now to hospitals, you can price operations, you can price everything
trump, It's a massive thing
trump, The man who did it… And I took a lot of heat, and I'm doing favorite nations drugs, meaning whatever the lowest in the world is, we have to pay the same
trump, That's the good news
trump, The bad news is the drug companies, the doctors everybody's angry at me
trump, Actually under price transparency, the good hospitals and the good doctors benefit tremendously, but the bad ones don't, and you have price transparency
trump, And it goes into effect on January 1st
trump, Could you imagine if this sleepy guy gets in and they say like, February, March, April something
trump, They say unbelievable what happened to prices, it's dropping like crazy
trump, And they'll say, what a job he's doing this president And I'm the one that signed it
trump, I said, could you put it into effect but statutorily It has to mature, mature, mature
trump, So the earliest I could get is January 1st
trump, It's like crazy
trump, You know another one I'll give you another one
trump, I'll give you another one
trump, So Air Force One, so that's the 757, but they have a 747, which is the big Air Force One
trump, I think that just disrespected the people of Minnesota today, they gave us the little one
trump, No, actually it's because of the runway
trump, In fact, when we landed, they said, Sir, we have a very short runway, could you please hold on I said, I trust these pilots
trump, By the way, these pilots are the best pilots
trump, When you fly the president of the United States
trump, Wait a minute, he's waving from the window
trump, When you fly the president of the United States, you are the best flyer
trump, They take the best air force guys, they take the best Marines in the helicopters, Marine One
trump, But when you're flying these planes, you can land that sucker, you have no problem
trump, There's no, mishits
trump, There's no, Let's go around
trump, I can't quite make it, Sir
trump, These guys are phenomenal
trump, You've got to see what they look like
trump, Everyone's in perfect shape
trump, I look at him, central casting, every one of them they're great
trump, Thank you fellas
trump, Thank you
trump, But I'll tell you a little story
trump, So Air Force One is a very old plane
trump, It's beautiful, but it's an old 747, right It's 31 years old and other people didn't want to do it, but it was time to get a new one
trump, It was time
trump, You got to get a new plane
trump, And actually Air Force One, I'll give you a little secret, it's actually two planes
trump, They get two
trump, It's a hell of a way to travel
trump, If one's not working perfect, you use the other one
trump, But they get two
trump, So Air Force One, they negotiated a price and they had it down for 5
trump,7 billion, that was not sounds expensive, and it's ridiculous, but that was done by the Obama administration
trump, It was done by the Obama administration
trump, And that's okay
trump, But no administration Obama, Bush, they didn't want to do it because it sounds luxury
trump, But at some point you got to buy a plane for the country
trump, And these Arab countries would have their beautiful 747, 800s, 900s pour in, and they were gorgeous
trump, And believe it or not, the new plane is a much bigger plane
trump, Much bigger wingspan, it's a much more beautiful plane, it's modern
trump, I think of a 31 years old, Air Force One is 31 years old, the main Air Force One, not this
trump, This is a great plane, but the big one 31 years old
trump, So you're representing the country, but they didn't want to do it because it shows luxury for two planes, in all fairness
trump, Now it's very technical, there's a lot of stuff
trump, I won't talk about it because I don't want to give away any classified information
trump, Just trust me, some more sophisticated sucker you've ever seen in your life
trump, I think you're getting into a plane that cost 5
trump,7 billion
trump, Right But it's the most sophisticated, two planes
trump, So I said, How much is it A general came, and an air force general, great guy, handsome guy
trump, They're all so good looking these people
trump, I said, So general, what are we paying What's the price  Sir, it's 5
trump,7 million and we're ready to go, Sir, could you sign it It sounds like a lot of money to me, General, 5
trump,7 million for two airplanes
trump, Can we get a better price No, sir
trump, This was negotiated by the Obama administration
trump, The Obama administration
trump, This was negotiated, Sir, by Barack Hussein Obama
trump, And I said, Oh, that's good
trump, It sounds very high
trump, So here's what I'm going to do
trump, Tell Boeing we're not taking the plane
trump, We have no interest in, it's too much
trump, This is what I did
trump, By the way, this is one of many stories
trump, Isn't this better than going and saying, I saved your Iron Range And I say, But please remember I did this too
trump, And I can do away with this stuff, but I did this too
trump, Please remember that because I have all this list of incredible things I've done for Minnesota, I won't even touch it because frankly I'm tired of repeating what I've done for all these different states
trump, I mean, I did all this stuff and then I hear I'm nine down
trump, I don't believe it by the way, suppression
trump, So I said to the general, I said, General, 5
trump,7 billion, not million, billion
trump, That sounds very high to me general
trump, I bought a lot of planes in my life and a lot of helicopters
trump, I know a lot about it
trump, How could it be five Sir, that's the best price they could get
trump, We only have one day to do it
trump, I said, Cancel it General
trump, Cancel the order
trump, It was signed actually
trump, Yes, Sir
trump, I said, Do you have the right to cancel it Yes, sir
trump, I do
trump, We negotiated a great deal
trump, I said, Oh good
trump, Cancel it
trump, Yes, sir
trump, I'm pleased to tell you something, Sir
trump, We have a breakup fee
trump, We made a great deal, Sir
trump, I said, You did Oh, you have a breakup fee
trump, You mean you can't just cancel it for nothing Then cancel it
trump, You don't have to pay a breakup fee
trump, I know about breakup fees
trump, No, Sir, we have a breakup fee
trump, Okay
trump, How much is it Sir, we can break it up for 250 million
trump, I said, Wait a minute
trump, So you mean to tell me that to cancel the order costs 250 million In other words, we give them 250 million, we get nothing
trump, I said, General, don't cancel the order
trump, Just tell him I'm very unhappy
trump, This is what these guys
trump, They're good businessmen, by the way
trump, These guys, right here, Mike, they might be better than you
trump, I don't even know
trump, He may be the next governor
trump, Mike Landell, maybe you should run
trump, You should run
trump, He is my complete and total investment
trump, You should run
trump, He'd be a hell of a governor
trump, At least, you know one thing
trump, Minnesota would be well promoted
trump, Mike, run for governor, please
trump, So he says, It's 250 million
trump, It's 250, Sir, I'm so proud of that
trump, I said, You may be proud, but I'm not
trump, So I said, General, don't give them notice because I don't want to write a check for 250 and getting nothing
trump, I don't think I could explain that to the American public
trump, So tell them you're really unhappy, we're not going to make the deal, but just do it verbally
trump, And, Yes, sir
trump, And then I spoke to the head of Boeing, a very nice guy
trump, They had some rough times since then
trump, They had a couple of really bad things happen
trump, Terrible, really terrible
trump, This was early on before the problems that they had
trump, But he is, he's a high quality guy
trump, And I said to him, Dennis, we have to start it with a… It's got to have a three on the front of it
trump, What do I know I just know that if they're 5
trump,7, and if I do something with a three
trump, He said, No, I can bring it down to 5
trump,5 billion
trump, So I say, Well, that's not bad
trump, I save 200 million in about a minute and a half phone call
trump, So so far I'm not good, but it's not good enough
trump, I'm not happy
trump, I said, No, we got to really think about canceling it
trump, And I can't go to Airbus, which is made in Europe
trump, It's a little hard, I got to go to their competitor
trump, I can't say I'm going to buy the Air Force One from a European company that doesn't work too well
trump, My only option was to say, Look, I just don't want to just put it aside
trump, He calls me up a few days later
trump, Well, we can do a little bit better than that
trump, I said, Dennis, has to have a three in front of it, Dennis
trump, Got to have a three
trump, Like a three, three anything, but got to have a three in front of it
trump, So he said, No, no, no
trump, After one month, we signed a contract for 3
trump,9 billion
trump, Same exact one
trump, Actually slightly better, we got an extra generator
trump, And then Boeing came to me, and I love to negotiate
trump, I do
trump, Got that from my father
trump, My father was a good negotiator and I love to negotiate
trump, So they came to me, Sir, we can put an extra stairway
trump, This is the big 747
trump, And remember this is a big, much bigger than the old 747
trump, Sir, it gets very windy up there
trump, I noticed that your hair's blown all over the place
trump, But we can buy a stairwell for the plane
trump, And it comes under, it's like a corkscrew right at the bottom of the plane
trump, You're very high off the ground, big, big thing
trump, And it opens up, and if it's raining or windy, you're covered, Sir, because it's under the plane
trump, You're totally sheltered
trump, I said, That sounds great
trump, So it's a corkscrew stairwell
trump, I said, How much is that general 50
trump, I said, 50, what a deal, So for 50,000 I can get a stairway No, sir
trump, 50 million
trump, I said, Forget about the stairwell
trump, Forget it
trump, He said 50
trump, I really thought he meant 50,000
trump, So these are just some little stories
trump, I guess I must like Minnesota to go on one of these deals
trump, But boy, did you get your money's worth tonight Is anybody having a bad time Did you get your money's worth Because you've heard the other one
trump, We've done this, and we've cut your taxes, and we built up the military bigger and better
trump, And we're the number one in history in regulation cuts, which is the biggest thing
trump, And the judges, which we've done at a level like nobody's ever done, everything we've done
trump, Nobody has done more in three and a half years, no administration three and a half
trump, Those first three and a half years, nobody even comes close
trump, And you know, it's a funny thing
trump, I say it all the time
trump, I've been saying it for a long time and the fake news, nobody even questions me about it
trump, And you know if I was wrong, they would, but they can't question me because when you see right to try, we took care of our vets
trump, We just got a 91 approval rating from the vets 91
trump, It's never happened before
trump, We got choice approved, we got accountability approved, drugs are way down
trump, We've got a little setback with this whole situation where these shutdowns cause a lot of problems with drugs, a lot of everything, but drugs were way down
trump, We had our best year in the history of our country last year
trump, And we're going to have a better year coming up
trump, That's why you have an obligation to vote for the guy that got you there
trump, And remember this, and I really appreciate this, thank you
trump, But I appreciate this because nine democrat mayors of cities in the Iron Range have endorsed me over Sleepy Joe
trump, What do you like better Sleepy Joe or Slow Joe What's better Let's do a poll
trump, We do a poll
trump, We do a poll
trump, I do free falls
trump, You know, these polls, they charge you a fortune for this stuff
trump, They interviewed three people and then they charge you a million dollars
trump, We interviewed 233 people, I got thousands of people at least for free
trump, What do you like better as nickname Slow Joe or Sleepy Joe So let's go
trump, Wait, Slow Joe first
trump, Okay So just scream if you like it
trump, So you have a choice, Slow Joe, they're both very appropriate
trump, Slow Joe or Sleepy Joe, ready Slow Joe
trump, I think we're going to have a winner here
trump, Sleepy Joe based steel, real crap
trump, It wasn't that, but when you think of it, they wrote it out
trump, You didn't have environmentally the right
trump, Somebody said, Oh, well he got a bit because he was good with negotiating with these other countries
trump, It wasn't that
trump, I opened it up
trump, I signed an order
trump, I signed an executive order because Obama took your Iron Range and Biden took your Iron Range away
trump, And I'll never forget
trump, The day I did it, and Tom was there, a man, I don't know who he is, he's probably in this massive audience, but he came up to me and he was a rough guy and he never cried in his life, including at childbirth
trump, He didn't cry at childbirth, but he was crying
trump, And he said, Sir, you gave our life back to us because Obama took our heart out when he closed up the Iron Range
trump, He said you gave our heart back
trump, It's true
trump, So I just want to thank those cities
trump, When a democrat mayor, and we have now a lot of… Now we have additional
trump, So these are democrat politicians and two weeks ago they endorsed us, and it's a great thing
trump, We're finding that all over the country
trump, Democrats for Trump
trump, Politicians that got elected as democrats, I don't think they changed their party affiliation, but they endorsed Trump
trump, They're all in the Iron Range area
trump, And Larry Cuffe is here
trump, Larry Cuffe
trump, Where's Larry Where is he Larry, how are you Why did you do that, Larry That's so nice
trump, I appreciate it
trump, Boy, are you good
trump, I wish you had a mic
trump, He said, Because you're the best candidate we could ever… I love this guy
trump, Said you're the best candidate we could ever hope for
trump, Thank you Larry, that's beautiful
trump, I appreciate it
trump, We'll do a good job
trump, We're not going to let you down
trump, And they're doing a good job over there
trump, So dig in, dig in, dig we must, right It's all going because of me
trump, That's cool, man
trump, Thank you
trump, No, he signed an executive order shutting it down
trump, Just shutting it down
trump, And I hear it's got the best iron ore anywhere in the world
trump, That's what I hear
trump, The quality is the best
trump, … or anywhere in the world
trump, That's what I hear
trump, The quality is the best
trump, And it's like an unlimited amount
trump, I'm talking about a little, this is a massive operation with thousands of people and everything else
trump, And for me, it was very easy
trump, Andrea Zupancich, where is she Where's Andrea Thank you very much
trump, That's really nice
trump, I'm glad that at least you got a good location, right That's great
trump, I appreciate it very much
trump, You're all friends I guess
trump, Chris Vreeland, where's Chris Chris Vreeland
trump, Chris Where's Chris The mayor Thank you, Chris
trump, Thank you, Chris
trump, Thank you very much
trump, Kathy Brandau
trump, Kathy Brandau
trump, Thank you, Kathy
trump, I hope you're having a good time tonight
trump, We're not going to let you down
trump, You know that
trump, We're open
trump, That sucker is open
trump, We're not closing it
trump, Well, think of this though
trump, If Biden gets in, it's closed
trump, He said he's going to close it
trump, How about this guy No fracking
trump, You're not going to frack
trump, Onstage with all these crazy people and they don't want any energy
trump, They think everything's going to run by wind, which costs you a fortune, about 20 times more than what we have and doesn't work
trump, But think of it, all of these people… And they say, What about fracking Fracking is the modern technology
trump, And so they all said, No, no, we're all against… everyone's against fracking
trump, What about you Yes, I'm against it too
trump, Now he's against it for months
trump, He gets it, now he's in favor of it
trump, But he's sort of grandfathering it
trump, You know, it's a very weak… Well, I like to grandfather fracking
trump, If I'm a fracker, I don't want to be grandfather
trump, I want to have it or not have it, right He wants to grandfather fracking
trump, Always go with their first statement, okay So I was in Texas two weeks ago, we had crowds
trump, Mike, we had crowds that went from the airplane to the well, to the drilling well, where we went to see a well
trump, And we saved the industry because I got Russia and Saudi Arabia to cut back 10 million barrels
trump, It actually was probably 18
trump, Ended up being, I think, 18
trump,5 million barrels
trump, And it saved the industry
trump, And yet you're still paying very low gasoline prices at the pump, but we saved 10 million jobs
trump, But I'm in Texas, and let me tell you, Texas appreciated it because that industry was in deep trouble because all of a sudden with the pandemic, there was no demand
trump, There was nobody driving, there was no demand
trump, Nobody ever saw anything like it
trump, So I'm in Texas and I said to the crowd, it was a great crowd, and we must have had a hundred thousand people on the road, on the highways and roadways waving
trump, And they had the most beautiful Trump flags
trump, I wanted to stop, Where did you buy that flag The most beautiful flags of me and our great vice president
trump, Is Mike Pence doing a good job by the way He did such a great… he worked 29 hours a day
trump, I mean, this guy works day and night
trump, He worked not the 24
trump, He worked 24 plus least five, okay
trump, This man is a worker and he's a wonderful human being
trump, And when they try it, a guy like Biden that can't carry his jockstrap
trump, When Biden goes, Oh, they should have closed one week earlier, and here's the guy that said I made a mistake when I banned China that nothing's going to happen
trump, It's so phony
trump, This politics is a very phony business
trump, I haven't been doing it long
trump, I told one of the senators that came in, he came into my office there,  I've been doing this for 30 years
trump, I've won many elections, I've only lost twice in my life
trump, I've been a Senator for a long time
trump, I know what I'm doing, sir
trump, I said, Yeah, and I've done it for four years
trump, And I've only won one election, but it's for the president of the United States
trump, I remember a certain man on television that didn't like me too much
trump, He said, They put together the greatest field ever assembled, the Republicans, remember 17 plus me
trump, They put together the greatest field of talent ever assembled
trump, I hear Trump wants to come in
trump, He's not going to do it number one
trump, Number two, if he does, he's just doing it for fun and he'll be out by September and then he'll go about leading his life, but he's not going to do it
trump, But we don't really need him because this is the greatest single assemblage of talent ever assembled for one party
trump, The greatest talent he's ever seen
trump, And then I did it and just week after week, one out, two out, three out, four out
trump, And then we've done changes
trump, Oh, he said, He can't do it because he doesn't have any experience
trump, But I actually do on the other side
trump, I contributed to politics
trump, I always found it very interesting
trump, So in a certain way, I had a lot of experience probably
trump, Maybe I had too much experience
trump, That's why I can tell you about AOC
trump, Check out the 2 million please, check it out, check it out
trump, Check out Omar, check out Omar, get to that great writer, he should get… Oh, so the New York Times won all these Pulitzer prizes, right I was going to tell you before
trump, All these Pulitzer prizes, these people, and they all got it wrong, right They got for Russia, Russia, Russia
trump, We give the Pulitzer prize
trump, I won't use names
trump, I won't use names, but we give the Pulitzer prize to the New York Times
trump, They got it wrong
trump, We give the Pulitzer prize to the Washington Post and all of these real sleazebags
trump, I have to be honest with you
trump, Very dishonest people, very dishonest
trump, I call it the Amazon Washington Post
trump, He uses that as his lobbyist because he owns the Washington Post
trump, He gets crap that other people wouldn't get, okay
trump, That means it's a lobby
trump, It's a lobbyist deal
trump, But they got the prize, right They got the Pulitzer prize
trump, All the guys that got it right, that really got it right, they all got it wrong, totally wrong
trump, And they should return the Pulitzer prize
trump, And Pulitzer association, the committee should ask for those prizes back
trump, They got it all wrong
trump, They were a hundred percent wrong
trump, There was no collusion
trump, They couldn't believe
trump, Remember the day when it was announced after three years, there is no collusion
trump, I could have told them that a day one, they could have saved 48 million dollars
trump, They got the Pulitzer
trump, And then you take guys so many, so many
trump, Solomon, Sara Carter, Bongino
trump, How about Dan Bongino So many, so talented guys
trump, How about that great gentlemen who wrote The Witch Hunt Remember that That was the first, right You know what I'm talking about
trump, He's fantastic
trump, All great
trump, These people should have won the Pulitzer prize
trump, Now I would say Sean Hannity and Lou Dobbs and Laura and Tucker
trump, In all fairness, Tucker was very good
trump, Tucker was great, but these are all people that got it right
trump, Now they don't do I guess the Pulitzer prize for that stuff, but they probably should
trump, But these guys all got it right
trump, And all they did was get a lot of money because they're very successful, and that's okay I guess
trump, But they should give the Pulitzer prize to the people that got it right and they should withdraw from all of those writers, many of whom are back there right now, all of those writers, they should do that
trump, And a candidate for Congress, Michelle Fischbach, who's supposed to be fantastic
trump, And Michelle has my complete and total endorsement
trump, But Jason, you're in good shape, wow
trump, You're in better shape than these Congressman Jase
trump, By the way, Jason is fantastic and he's doing a fantastic… Where's Michelle Is she there Be careful
trump, It's not worth the broken legs
trump, Look at her
trump, Oh, she's a warrior, I can tell
trump, Come on up
trump, But thanks, Michelle
trump, And they have my complete endorsement
trump, They're great people
trump, They love your state
trump, They love our country
trump, So just in conclusion, I want to say that over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world
trump, And we will end our reliance on China once and for all
trump, We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States
trump, And you probably heard me today
trump, It used to be Puerto Rico did tremendous dollars in medical supplies
trump, And then what happened They made a lot, they did a good job, and Obama Biden destroyed it
trump, They took away the incentive, all of the taxes
trump, And they took away the incentive and Puerto Rico went down a long way
trump, We'll get some of that back to Puerto Rico and we'll get it back for us
trump, Take it away from China
trump, You heard that, yes They took it away
trump, And then people automatically vote
trump, It's like a habit
trump, Will I vote for the Democrat The Democrat was so bad to you
trump, And how bad were the Democrats to Israel We did Jerusalem, right We broke up the Iran deal, right And then they vote for a Democrat
trump, It's out of habit, but I think the habits, we're breaking those habits very quickly
trump, But we've helped Puerto Rico and we've really helped… If you look at what we've done for Israel, it's been incredible
trump, They say nobody's done more
trump, And it's my honor
trump, But we'll hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities, which are a disaster
trump, We'll appoint tough on crime prosecutors
trump, We will nominate judges and justices who interpret the constitution as written
trump, We will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed
trump, We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life
trump, And that's why the Supreme court is so important
trump, The next president will get one, two, three, or four Supreme court justices
trump, I had two
trump, Many presidents have had none
trump, They've had none because they're there for a long time
trump, They tend to be appointed young
trump, They're there for a long time
trump, But the next one we'll have anywhere from one to four
trump, Think of that
trump, That will totally change when you talk about life, when you talk about second amendment, when you talk about things that are so important to you
trump, You're going to be stuck for 40 years, 35 years, a long time
trump, So this is going to be the most important election, in my opinion, in the history of our country
trump, You got to get it right
trump, Because if you don't get it right, we will not have a country anymore
trump, You're not going to have a country
trump, Not as we know it
trump, You won't have a country anymore
trump, We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms
trump, We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of these ridiculous, horrible, endless foreign wars
trump, Countries you've never heard of
trump, Coming home
trump, We will maintain America's unrivaled military mind, and we will ensure peace through strength
trump, This is what we have now
trump, Peace through strength
trump, Remember what I told you about those weapons, we don't want to use ever, we don't want to use those weapons
trump, We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, January 1st
trump, He doesn't even have to do anything now
trump, I'll be so angry if he… They'll say, What a job he's done on transparency, can you believe it And he won't even know what transparency is
trump, And it's complex
trump, And further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs
trump, We've done that already
trump, We will strongly protect Medicare and social security, and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions
trump, America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars
trump, And we brought NASA back
trump, NASA, when I got in three and a half years ago, grass was growing through the cracks of the runway
trump, It was over, it was closed
trump, It was nothing
trump, Now it's the number one space center in the entire world by a factor of five
trump, We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools
trump, We will
trump, We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag
trump, And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, in God we trust
trump, You know that the Democrat national convention and the pledge of allegiance at a caucus, two of them, not one
trump, I heard the first one, I said, Oh, they must've made a mistake
trump, They left under God out of the pledge of allegiance
trump, Yeah, yeah, yeah
trump, Now they then said, Oh, well we didn't mean that
trump, They meant it
trump, That's what they're going to do
trump, They're going to take God out of it
trump, Just like I was saying before, Texas, they don't want God, they don't want oil, they don't want guns
trump, I don't think they're going to do too well in Texas
trump, Do you agree with that I don't think they're going to do too well in Minnesota either
trump, No, but could you imagine you're campaigning, and it doesn't play too well here, but could you imagine you're in Texas and you have a guy say, No oil, no God, no guns
trump, Oh, I think I'm going to vote for Joe Biden, everybody
trump, And then they say, Texas is in play, it's a very close… I have a friend in Texas
trump, He said, I think you're winning by 15 points
trump, These people are crazy
trump, Texas is in play
trump, They don't want to let you have oil
trump, Think of it
trump, It's unbelievable
trump, Texas is in play
trump, That's the fake news back there
trump, They said it last time too
trump, Remember Texas, when they say in play, that means it's too close to call
trump, It's in play
trump, Too close
trump, We've heard that for a long time, in play, right Too close to call
trump, And they said it four years ago, Texas is in play
trump, This could be a terrible defeat, losing Texas
trump, Big state, great state
trump, This would be a tremendous defeat
trump, And they said it about Ohio too
trump, I think we won by like nine points
trump, Right They said Ohio is in play
trump, Utah's in play
trump, We won by a lot
trump, Remember we beat a guy named McMuffin
trump, Remember the guy He was going to take the state of Utah
trump, And then he was going to be able to negotiate
trump, But that didn't work out
trump, He came in third
trump, Even Hillary beat him
trump, But they said Texas is in play
trump, And I'd go around telling my people, Damn it, Texas is in play, how the hell Every time I go there, I have 35,000 people at the stadium, how could it possibly be in play They said it's in play
trump, My people would say, I don't think so
trump, And we had a big Texas rancher
trump, He was on one of the shows
trump, He was wearing a big, beautiful hat
trump, I wish I could wear those hots
trump, It wouldn't work for me too well
trump, I don't think it works for me, right But it worked for him
trump, And he said, I don't know too much about a lot, but I know one thing
trump, Texas is not in play
trump, And this guy is going to win Texas by a hell of a lot of votes
trump, And that's what happened that night, the night of the election
trump, The night of the election, they called the results
trump, I've been listening for six months, Texas is so close, we can't even imagine it it's so close
trump, This is big
trump, And they only call the election immediately if you win in a landslide, it's got to be tremendous
trump, And they said, Texas has closed its doors
trump, Ladies and gentlemen, Donald Trump has won the state of Texas
trump, They didn't even say the polls were closed
trump, They forgot to say the polls were closed
trump, I wanted to say
trump, I said, How come I won I called my people, How could I have won It was so close they called it before they even said the doors closed
trump, And I heard from the governor of Texas, great guy, Greg Abbott
trump, I said, How are we doing compared to four years ago We did great four years ago, big, big win
trump, He said, Sir, you're doing much better
trump, But these guys keep saying it's in play
trump, It's the same way that I'm down nine points in Minnesota
trump, If I lose Minnesota, if I lose Minnesota, Jason, I'm going to blame Jason if I lose
trump, Boy, we almost had it last time
trump, But we did the right thing
trump, We went to Michigan, we won Michigan, first time in many, many years, that Michigan was won
trump, It's a great state
trump, For years you had a president who apologized for America
trump, And now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for Minnesota
trump, So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and get out and vote
trump, And you know it's starting today in Minnesota
trump, That's why I'm here
trump, It started today
trump, Go out of here
trump, You know what If they're closed, what the hell time is it now If they're closed, just stand in line like you do
trump, People were here two days ago trying to get in here
trump, It's crazy
trump, So do the same thing at the voting booth, please
trump, From St
trump, Paul to St
trump, Cloud, from Rochester to Duluth, and from Minneapolis, thank God we still have Minneapolis, to right here, right here with all of you great people, this state was pioneered by men and women who braved the wilderness and the winters to build a better life for themselves and for their families
trump, They were tough and they were strong
trump, You have good genes
trump, You know that, right You have good genes
trump, A lot of it's about the genes, isn't it Don't you believe The resource theory you think was so different You have good genes in Minnesota
trump, They didn't have a lot of money
trump, They didn't have a lot of luxury, but they had grit, they had faith, and they had each other
trump, That's what you have now
trump, You have each other
trump, They were miners and lumberjacks, fishermen and farmers, shipbuilders and shopkeepers
trump, But they all had one thing in common
trump, They loved their families, they loved their countries, and they loved their God
trump, Proud citizens like you helped build this country
trump, And together we are taking back our country
trump, We are returning power to you, the American people
trump, With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we're going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning
trump, And don't forget, you went through years where you weren't winning, right Years and years, they closed down
trump, Even with Obama, he closed that iron
trump, I think he just wanted to get even with you, I don't know
trump, He wasn't good
trump, Not a good… We've knocked out about 84 of the things he did
trump, Then you say, I wonder if he likes me But you're getting used to winning and you're going to see winning like you've never seen before
trump, You had your best year and you're going to win so much
trump, You've heard this, right I haven't said it in a long time because we've been doing a lot of winning, but you're going to win so much
trump, And you're going to send Jason to the US Senate
trump, And you're going to keep winning and winning and winning
trump, You're going to win on trade, you're going to win on the military
trump, You're going to win on everything you touch
trump, Minnesota is going to keep on winning and you're going to get tired of winning because Minnesota doesn't want to win all the time
trump, Your football team is going to win in the big 10 they say, right No, we are going to keep on winning in Minnesota
trump, And you're going to get so tired you're going to say, Jason, Jason, please, please Jason, go to the president
trump, See him in the oval office
trump, Stop him from winning
trump, We're winning too much in Minnesota
trump, We can't stand it
trump, Jason, please, please Jason
trump, Stop him from winning so much for Minnesota
trump, We can't take it
trump, We're not used to it because we went through years and years and years where it was tough, right The mayors know that
trump, That's why they all endorsed the president
trump, And I'm going to look at Jason, I'm going to say, No, Jason, I'm sorry
trump, The people of Minnesota want to win, you're wrong, Jason

trump, And together with the incredible people of Minnesota, and you know what's going to be operating at strength Because I owe it to these incredible mayors that were so nice to me
trump, That was such a nice thing
trump, And I didn't politick you at all
trump, I never politicked you
trump, I said how nice
trump, And it's happening with so many other things
trump, We have other endorsements from police forces that I never asked and all of a sudden they're coming from very hostile territory
trump, So I just appreciate your being here
trump, And I'm saying this for you and I'm saying it for all of you
trump, Okay

trump, Thank you
trump, All I can say is that the fake news just doesn't get it, do they They don't get it
trump, They just don't get it
trump, Hello Charleston, and I'm thrilled to be back in the great state of South Carolina with thousands of hardworking American Patriots who believe in faith, family, God, and country
trump, Thank you
trump, It's a phenomenal crowd, only topped by the number of people outside that didn't get in
trump, If anybody would like to give up where you're standing or your seat, please raise your hand
trump, All right
trump, Then let's begin, right Thank you all very much though
trump, This is great
trump, No, they don't get it
trump, Down the road, they have a rally for one of the people that are going to be running tomorrow
trump, They're trying to get to a hundred, but they're not going to make it
trump, So I think they're going to set up a round table
trump, Well, that's what they do
trump, So people want to go to a rally, they end up sitting at a round table talking about their definition of impeachment
trump, Crazy
trump, No, it's crazy
trump, Crazy It's a crazy deal
trump, No, the fake news media, they've been trying to figure this out for years
trump, They still don't get it though
trump, They don't get it
trump, Look at all of those cameras
trump, Look at all of those cameras
trump, That's a lot of cameras
trump, That's a lot of cameras, Lindsey and Tim, that's a lot of… They heard you guys were here
trump, They heard Tim was here and that Lindsey was here and that… And they said, We're not going to attend that rally, but when we heard those two guys plus our great congressmen, they're here, great congressmen
trump, But this is an incredible time for our nation
trump, We're thrilled to be in the midst of what we call the Great American Comeback and that's what it is
trump, Jobs are booming, incomes are soaring, factories are returning, poverty is plummeting, confidence is surging, and we have completely rebuilt the awesome power of the United States military
trump, Our country is stronger than ever before
trump, We are stronger, we are better, but while we are building a great future, the radical left Democrats in Washington are trying to burn it all down
trump, They have spent the last three years, and I can even go further than that, three years since the election, but we go before the election, working to erase your ballots and overthrow our democracy
trump, But with your help, we have exposed the far left's corruption and defeated their sinister schemes and let's see what happens in the coming months
trump, Let's watch
trump, Let's just watch
trump, Very dishonest people
trump, Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus, you know that right Coronavirus, they're politicizing it
trump, We did one of the great jobs
trump, You say, How's President Trump doing They go, Oh, not good, not good
trump, They have no clue
trump, They don't have any clue
trump, They can't even count their votes in Iowa
trump, They can't even count
trump, No, they can't
trump, They can't count their votes
trump, One of my people came up to me and said, Mr
trump, President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia
trump, That didn't work out too well
trump, They couldn't do it
trump, They tried the impeachment hoax
trump, That was on a perfect conversation
trump, They tried anything
trump, They tried it over and over
trump, They'd been doing it since you got in
trump, It's all turning
trump, They lost
trump, It's all turning
trump, Think of it
trump, Think of it
trump, And this is their new hoax
trump, But we did something that's been pretty amazing
trump, We have 15 people in this massive country and because of the fact that we went early
trump, We went early, we could have had a lot more than that
trump, We're doing great
trump, Our country is doing so great
trump, We are so unified
trump, We are so unified
trump, The Republican party has never ever been unified like it is now
trump, There has never been a movement in the history of our country like we have now
trump, Never been a movement
trump, So a statistic that we want to talk about, go ahead
trump, Say USA
trump, It's okay
trump, USA
trump, So a number that nobody heard of, that I heard of recently and I was shocked to hear it, 35,000 people on average die each year from the flu
trump, Did anyone know that 35,000, that's a lot of people
trump, It could go to 100,000, it could be 27,000
trump, They say usually a minimum of 27, goes up to 100,000 people a year die
trump, And so far we have lost nobody to coronavirus in the United States
trump, Nobody
trump, And it doesn't mean we won't and we are totally prepared
trump, It doesn't mean we won't, but think of it
trump, You hear 35 and 40,000 people and we've lost nobody and you wonder the press is in hysteria mode
trump, CNN fake news and the camera just went off, the camera
trump, The camera just went off
trump, Turn it back on
trump, Hey, by the way, hold it
trump, Look at this, and honestly, all events are like this
trump, It's about us
trump, It's all about us
trump, I wish they'd take the camera, show the arena please
trump, They never do
trump, They never do
trump, They never do it
trump, They never show the arena
trump, You can hear it because when you hear it, that's not 200 people
trump, That's not a hundred people
trump, That's thousands and thousands of people including people outside
trump, You can hear it
trump, They always show my face
trump, See that face They show my face
trump, I want them to show the arena, not my face, right How many have you been to How many rallies have you gone Practically every one
trump, Can you believe it I'm sure your husbands are thrilled, right They're thrilled
trump, Where are you going tonight I'm going to another Trump rally
trump, Cool
trump, Number 114
trump, What do your husbands say about that This group up here
trump, She said, We don't care
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you
trump, Democrats will only say horrible things even though they know we're doing a great job
trump, We're doing a great job with what we have to work with
trump, It's incredible
trump, The Democrats want us to fail so badly
trump, Even if their actions, and you take a look, hurt the people of this country, they'll hurt the people themselves, their wealth, their everything
trump, They're willing to hurt our country in order to say bad, even if they know it's not so
trump, We made an unbelievable deal with Mexico, with Canada, with China, with South Korea, with Japan
trump, And if you put a microphone with these people back there like the Academy Awards used to be, not anymore
trump, Best movie of the year
trump, It's made in South Korea
trump, What's that all about I'm waiting to see the best movie of the year- And it's made… He said, It's garbage
trump, Only in South Carolina can you say that
trump, Only in South Carolina
trump, You're going to get us in trouble
trump, No, I'm just repeating what he said for the fake news
trump, No, but seriously the Academy Awards has gone way, way down in ratings
trump, Do you know why Because they started attacking us and we don't believe in it anymore
trump, That's why
trump, No, but they had the best movie of the year made in South Korea
trump, They make enough stuff for us, right And they're good
trump, They're our friends
trump, Take advantage of us, that's okay
trump, Not so much anymore
trump, We are really, you take a look, magnificently organized with the best professionals in the world
trump, We're prepared for the absolute worst
trump, You have to be prepared for the worst, but hopefully it will all amount to very little
trump, That's why I tell you when we have the flu with 35,000 people and this one we have to take it very, very seriously
trump, That's what we're doing
trump, We are preparing for the worst
trump, My administration has taken the most aggressive action in modern history to prevent the spread of this illness in the United States
trump, We are ready
trump, We are ready
trump, Totally ready
trump, On January 31st, I ordered the suspension of foreign nationals who have recently been in China from entering the United States
trump, An action which the Democrats loudly criticized and protested and now everybody's complimenting me saying, Thank you very much
trump, You were 100 correct
trump, Could've been a whole different story
trump, But I say, so let's get this right
trump, A virus starts in China, bleeds its way into various countries all around the world, doesn't spread widely at all in the United States because of the early actions that myself and my administration took against a lot of other wishes, and the Democrats' single talking point, and you see it, is that it's Donald Trump's fault, right It's Donald Trump's fault
trump, No, just things that happened
trump, But you know what this does show you Things happen
trump, Whoever thought of this two weeks ago Who would've thought this could be going on four weeks ago You wouldn't
trump, But things happen in life and you have to be prepared and you have to be flexible and you have to be able to go out and get it
trump, And my guys that we have the best professionals in the world, the best in the world and we are so ready
trump, At the same time that I initiated the first federally mandated quarantine in over 50 years
trump, We had a quarantine some people
trump, They weren't happy, they weren't happy about it
trump, I want to tell you there are a lot of people that not so happy, but after two weeks they got happy
trump, You know who got happy The people around them got happy
trump, That's who got happy
trump, I also created a White House virus task force
trump, It's a big thing, a virus task force
trump, I requested 2
trump,5 billion dollars to ensure we have the resources we need
trump, The Democrats said, That's terrible
trump, He's doing the wrong thing
trump, He needs eight and a half billion, not two and a half
trump, I've never had that before
trump, I ask for two and a half, they want to give me eight and a half, so I said, I'll take it
trump, Does that make me a bad… I'll take it
trump, I'll take it
trump, I never had that before
trump, I never had it
trump, We want two and a half million
trump, That's plenty
trump, We demand you take eight and a half
trump, He doesn't know what he's doing
trump, We want eight and a half
trump, These people are crazy
trump, We must understand that border security is also health security
trump, And you've all seen the wall has gone up like magic
trump, It's gone up like magic
trump, You think that was an easy one That was not an easy one
trump, It's going up great and we're up now 132 miles and this is the exact wall that border security, water, everything
trump, This is everything they wanted, 132 miles already
trump, We'll have 500 miles built by very early next year sometime
trump, One of the reasons the numbers are so good
trump, We will do everything in our power to keep the infection and those carrying the infection from entering our country
trump, We have no choice
trump, Whether it's the virus that we're talking about or many other public health threats, the Democrat policy of open borders is a direct threat to the health and wellbeing of all Americans
trump, Now you see it with the coronavirus, you see it
trump, You see it with the coronavirus
trump, You see that
trump, When you have this virus or any other virus or any other problem coming in, it's not the only thing that comes in through the border
trump, And we're setting records now at the border
trump, We're setting records
trump, And now just using this, so important, right So important
trump, I'm doing well in the polls despite the worst fake news and worst presidential harassment in the history of the United States
trump, We've got phenomenal numbers
trump, No, it's true
trump, The worst presidential harassment in history
trump, We had a great event yesterday, an event that was so beautiful, young African American leaders
trump, One of the things I asked them, and I've been thinking about this for a long time… And great people, great people
trump, Some of them are here tonight
trump, Do you like the name African American or Black And they said, Black all at the same time
trump, No, true
trump, I tell you
trump, Because you say, African American or Black And they said almost immediately, Black
trump, But we had an incredible group of people and what happened is NBC… It was such a love fest
trump, It was so incredible
trump, It went on for 45 minutes
trump, It was a love fest
trump, It was incredible
trump, NBC turned down… There they are right there
trump, They turned down… Comcast, which owns NBC… Actually NBC, I think, we call it MSDNC, right MSDNC
trump, But NBC I think is worse than CNN
trump, I actually do
trump, And Comcast, a company that spends millions and millions of dollars on their image… I'll do everything possible to destroy their image because they are terrible
trump, They are terrible
trump, They're a terrible group of people
trump, And they paid me a fortune for years for the Apprentice
trump, They paid me a fortune
trump, And when I left the show, it was doing great
trump, When I left the show, 14 seasons, think of that, they got a big movie star
trump, I won't tell you his name
trump, Nobody would know
trump, Actually nobody will know his name because he was on for such a short period of time
trump, But the show went down the tubes very quickly after they had Trump
trump, But the country in five years from now, of course you want to upset them, five years or nine years or 13 years
trump, Or 18 years 10 more years
trump, Nah
trump, Oh, they go crazy when you say it
trump, When you say to them five more years, so it's five, but you then say maybe nine, maybe 13, maybe 17, maybe 21, or not, maybe 21
trump, Let's do this
trump, Let's term limit ourselves at 25 years
trump, No more than 25 years
trump, No more
trump, Okay
trump, They'll pass something in the Senate
trump, Tim, pass it in the Senate with Lindsey, a 25 year term limit please
trump, 07
trump, While the extreme left has been wasting America's time with these vile hoaxes, we've been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, enacting fair trade deals, securing our border, and lifting up citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed
trump, We added another 225,000 jobs last month alone
trump, And that makes seven million jobs since our election, seven million
trump, The unemployment rate in the great state of South Carolina
trump, You ever hear of that place Now Sleepy Joe would say, The unemployment rate in the great state of Ohio… No, no
trump, You're in South Carolina
trump, Joe Joe, you're in South Carolina
trump, Come up
trump, You ever see the guy with the note, No, no, it's South Carolina It's not Ohio
trump, Okay
trump, Then he goes, All right, Iowa
trump, Did you say Iowa No
trump, No
trump, They did that seven times
trump, If I did that once, it would be the end of the road, right Be the end of the road
trump, They'd say Trump has lost it
trump, They like to say that anyway, I guess though
trump, These people are bad people
trump, Now, Sleepy Joe
trump, Well, he's running tomorrow
trump, No, but could you imagine if I said just a small fraction of the mistakes he makes, which are unbelievable Every speech
trump, I actually said the other night, I was watching him when he said about half the population wiped out with guns
trump, I said, That's a horrible thing
trump, That's the end of his evening
trump, That's the end of his political career
trump, And then after the debate, they're revealing him and they said, Joe Biden had a great night last night
trump, I don't get it, Tim
trump, The unemployment rate here in South Carolina has fallen to 2
trump,3, the lowest rate in your state's history
trump, The lowest rate in all of America
trump, It's the lowest rate in all of America
trump, I said to a friend of mine, a Democrat, How's the race going tomorrow Who's going to win And he says, Mr
trump, President… No, it's very interesting
trump, He said something
trump, This guy's a real political pro too, in all fairness, even though he's a Democrat
trump, But I said, Who's going to win He said, Honestly, sir, it doesn't matter
trump, You are so far ahead in South Carolina that it's meaningless
trump, Meaningless
trump, That's what they say
trump, And in North Carolina too
trump, In North Carolina, bunch of losers
trump, The good citizens of South Carolina have had a front row seat to the extremism of the Democrat candidates
trump, Whether it's this character that nobody ever heard of him
trump, I'd never heard it
trump, I thought I knew all the wealthy people
trump, This guy Tom, Mr
trump, Impeachment, how did that work out, Tom Hey, he spent millions and millions of dollars in Iowa, right Millions
trump, He got less than 1
trump, He got one third of 1
trump, I wrote a little note
trump, Did you see it It said, Tom, it's not so easy doing what I did
trump, Is it Not so easy
trump, Not so easy
trump, All you have to do is ask Mini Mike
trump, He's in there for a fortune
trump, He wished he never started
trump, Mini Mike, he wished he never started
trump, He said, Well, Trump can do it
trump, I'm going to do it too
trump, Unfortunately it's not working out too well
trump, Was that the worst debate performance in history They had a big audience
trump, Everybody wanted to see whether or not he was good at what we're supposed to be doing up here
trump, He turned out to be a total catastrophe
trump, 35 million people, can you believe that That's a big audience
trump, Very big
trump, And what a killer
trump, But this guy Steyer, he spends all this money
trump, He's not that wealthy
trump, He spends all of this money and you shouldn't waste your vote on him tomorrow
trump, I have to be honest
trump, By the way, are the Republicans allowed to vote anyway even though… Are you ready You ready Let's do it together
trump, I assume this is okay from a campaign finance standpoint, I assume
trump, Lindsey, Tim, our great congressmen, are we allowed to do this So am I allowed to request… First we- Congressman, are we allowed to do this Am I allowed to request … First, we have to figure out who would be the weakest candidate against President Trump
trump, And then if it's legal, I always say if it's permissible by law, because they have so many little booby traps, but they only like getting the Republicans
trump, Democrats skirt, right But we'll see what happens about that
trump, The Democrats
trump, But let me ask you this
trump, Lindsey, Tim, you're pros
trump, These are two of the greatest guys I know
trump, So let me ask you this
trump, So I don't know what the record attendance is in this arena, but I was told that we broke it by a lot
trump, And you got the people outside
trump, Are we allowed to tell them who we would like them to vote for Because you're allowed to skip
trump, All right, so wait a minute, let's do a poll
trump, We do this for the fake news back there
trump, Ready Who would be the best candidate for us Not for them
trump, We're ready
trump, Ready So let's go through them just quickly
trump, We won't include Steyer because he's a loser
trump, He's out, okay We won't include him
trump, Who would be the best This is a real poll
trump, This isn't one of those fake polls taken by … In all fairness, I love you, Fox, taken by Fox, the worst pollster
trump, This guy … this pollster hates Trump's guts
trump, I was losing the last election by a fortune
trump, They said, He did great with women
trump, Everything was wrong
trump, And they never replaced this guy
trump, But watch this
trump, You ready So first we'll go … let's say sleepy Joe, right Right Then we'll go crazy Bernie
trump, Then we'll go mini Mike
trump, I think he's out of it
trump, Should we include mini Mike or not Mini Mike is gone
trump, Mini Mike is gone
trump, I think he's gone
trump, He doesn't have a chance
trump, So let's not talk … and he's not in your election anyways, so let's forget
trump, So mini Mike, I hear mini Mike, by the way, has left
trump, He's basically given up
trump, That's what I hear
trump, He gave up
trump, He gave up
trump, Now, I hope what I just said keeps him in
trump, You know, he's the kind of a guy, he'll stay in because, I don't want to be wrong
trump, Mike, it's time to go home
trump, Go home, Mike, and enjoy your life
trump, Go home and spend some money on something horrible to people
trump, They said, She's not dumb, but she's just damn mean
trump, We can't vote for her
trump, She's a mean one
trump, She is mean
trump, So Pocahontas, should we leave her in or out How about Klobuchar Not going to happen
trump, So really we're down to two candidates, right Sleepy Joe Biden and crazy Bernie
trump, So this is a poll
trump, I guarantee you this
trump, As much as they hate me, they hate me
trump, They're going to put this all over the place
trump, We have a poll of like 30,000 people inside and out
trump, They're doing it outside, too
trump, We have a poll
trump, Are you ready Who do I … So in other words, who's the weaker of the two I'm not interested in who does better
trump, No, no
trump, I'm not interested … wait
trump, Ready In other words, who do I want to run against Meaning … very simple
trump, We put it into nice, simple language
trump, Who the hell is easier to beat So who is easier for us Not me
trump, For us to beat
trump, Ready Crazy Bernie Or sleepy Joe I don't know
trump, I think maybe a crazy Bernie has it a little bit
trump, Once more just quick
trump, Ready He said, It doesn't matter, you'll beat them all
trump, I hope so
trump, I hope so
trump, So who is easier to beat, crazy Bernie or sleepy Joe They think Bernie's easier to beat
trump, They think Bernie's easier to beat
trump, So whether it's Bernie Sanders' plan to eliminate private healthcare, Elizabeth Warren's plan
trump, I told you that I had more Indian blood in me than her, even though I have none
trump, I have none
trump, Zero
trump, I have none
trump, I have none
trump, I said I have more Indian blood in me than she has
trump, And she choked
trump, She said, I'm going to show
trump, I'm going to show
trump, She hired this company and they went out and did a blood test
trump, 1,024th, right So that means I probably one somewhere down the line a million years ago
trump, I'm telling you, that was horrible
trump, She choked
trump, We don't want a person to win that chokes
trump, We don't want to choke artist, right One thing you will say about me, I'm not a choker
trump, With all these people for years, they're after me years
trump, We can't have chokers
trump, We can't have chokers as your president
trump, So Elizabeth Warren's plan to eliminate America's borders
trump, That's what she would … or mini Mike's plan to eliminate your Second Amendment and take away your guns
trump, How about that Mini Mike wants to take away your guns
trump, The insanity of the Democrat party is why millions of registered Democrat voters are joining our movement
trump, They are joining our great new Republican party
trump, This November, we are going to take back the House
trump, We are going to hold the Senate, and we are going to keep the White House
trump, I wonder what they say when they go down the road and they see these groups of 200 people
trump, Seriously
trump, I wonder what they say
trump, They never talk about it
trump, They'll say, Joe Biden had a fabulous crowd today
trump, Fabulous
trump, So fabulous that there's like five people
trump, And they'll leave and they'll say, President Trump had a smattering of applause
trump, Smattering
trump, They use the word smattering a lot
trump, This is not … let's let them hear it
trump, This is not a … this is a big … this is not a smattering
trump, It's not a smattering
trump, Turn the cameras
trump, That's not a smattering
trump, That is not a smattering
trump, I hate it
trump, They say Donald Trump … In India, I hate to say this to you, but … so they actually have 129,000 seat stadium
trump, Did you see it The place was packed, and they did better than most
trump, They gave me credit for 100,000
trump, That was not bad
trump, It's 129
trump, The stadium holds 100
trump, They had a field that's about three times … it's cricket
trump, It's the biggest stadium
trump, And they had 129
trump, I was with the Prime Minister of India, Modi
trump, Great guy, loved by the people of India
trump, And we had an amazing thing
trump, And I went in, and here's the problem
trump, This is a big crowd
trump, And normally I like talking about my crowds because I get the crowds like nobody, but I just got back from 140 or 50 or 60,000 people and now I'm coming here
trump, What does this place hold, 15 It's hard to be enthused
trump, You understand that I may never be excited again about a crowd after going to India
trump, Think of this, they have 1
trump,5 billion people
trump, We have 350, so we're doing pretty well, I'll tell you what, but I love this crowd, and I love that crowd too
trump, Tell you they have a great love for … They have a great love
trump, They have a great leader, and they have a great love for the people of this country
trump, That was really a worthwhile trip
trump, With us tonight are both of your incredible US Senators
trump, Two incredible friends, two warriors
trump, Senator Lindsey Graham and Senator Tim Scott, come up here
trump, And by the way, Tim's incredible mother is right here in the front row
trump, As they're doing that, they got this big … I was going to almost do a poll on the two of them, but we're not doing that
trump, But Lindsey is a true fighter for South Carolina
trump, Loves your state
trump, And as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee … you know that, right He's the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee
trump, So important
trump, So important
trump, Senator Graham has been leading the charge to help us confirm a record number of judges to uphold the Constitution as written
trump, Lindsey was amazing, you remember, for Justice Brett Kavanaugh Remember how badly he … Great job, Lindsey
trump, Great job, man
trump, Thank you
trump, Senator Scott is a leading superstar
trump, He's a superstar
trump, But he is a leader in lowering healthcare costs like nobody has done it
trump, People don't know, but in the last year, prescription drug prices came down for the first time in 51 years
trump, And that was with no Democrat help
trump, If we had the help, we could lower it by 50
trump, But we'll get their help
trump, One of these days, they're going to get smart
trump, Senator Scott provides world class care for our veterans
trump, What he's done for our veterans is incredible
trump, And bringing investment to distressed communities across our country through opportunity zones, including 135 right here in South Carolina
trump, That's what it is
trump, Tim Scott came to my office with an idea
trump, He said, Opportunity zone
trump, I said, Tim, what the hell is that What is it Right, Tim And he went through a whole big thing and I said, This maybe could work, and we tried it
trump, It is an incredible success, and what he's done for this country is incredible
trump, It's incredible
trump, Lindsey
trump, We'll start with Lindsey
trump, Say a few words, please
trump, Thank you
trump, Well, that was quite a display, wasn't it Now there's a lot of love in this room
trump, A lot of people say to me, friends of mine, they've very successful
trump, They'll say, How do you speak in front of 25,000 people and 10,000 people and all of this You know why There's such love in the room it's easy
trump, No, it's true
trump, There is such … I explained, they don't understand it, because they're not for doing that, but I say there is such unbelievable love in the room that it's easy to do
trump, Very easy
trump, Right It's sort of easy to do
trump, We're also thrilled to be joined by many more great leaders from across the state
trump, And some of you maybe know I liked this guy for a long time, Governor Henry McMaster
trump, Come up, Henry
trump, Come up, Henry
trump, Representatives Joe Wilson, Jeff Duncan, William Timmons, Ralph Norman, Tom Rice, and the Chairman of the South Carolina Republican party, Drew McKissick
trump, As I introduce somebody, and I'll just say stay there because he was brave, but he got hit hard
trump, He's a very special man, retired Marine Corps, major general, and most of you know he received the Congressional Medal of Honor, James E
trump, Livingston
trump, James, just relax
trump, Where's James He got hit hard
trump, Thank you, James
trump, Congressional Medal of Honor winner
trump, Thank you, James
trump, They are great brave people
trump, You know, we have the Congressional Medal of Honor and we have the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and they're both the highest awards
trump, One civilian, one is military
trump, I always say getting the Presidential Medal of Freedom is much less painful because when I read them off, I'll read like with James or with so many of the Congressional Medal of Honors, many are not living, to be honest with you
trump, And I'll read stories where one of them recently going up a hill, hit 19 times by gunfire, grabbing four people, bringing them down, getting onto a helicopter, falling out of the helicopter, hitting a tree on the way down
trump, Hitting a tree
trump, They went back and saved him, but he died later
trump, I mean, those are tough deals
trump, Those are tough deals
trump, We have one right here who's living
trump, We have one right here who's living
trump, But they are tough
trump, So thank you very much for being here
trump, And maybe I could ask our governor, our great governor of this incredible state, to say a few words
trump, Please, Henry
trump, Thank you very much
trump, And where's Alan Is your son here You're great son, Attorney General Alan, thank you very much
trump, Take good care of him, okay Thank you
trump, Thank you, Alan
trump, And thanks to Republicans all over America

trump, Since my election, over 121,000 new jobs have been created right here in South Carolina
trump, We've lifted 10 million people off welfare, including 7 million off of food stamps
trump, And that's a good thing, not a bad thing
trump, They're working and they have great jobs and they love getting up in the morning and they're making much more money and it costs our country nothing
trump, We make money, they pay taxes
trump, It's a whole different deal
trump, Median household income has reached the highest level in the history of our country
trump, The unemployment rate nationwide has hit the lowest rate in over 50 years
trump, The average unemployment rate from my administration is the lowest for any US president in recorded history

trump, Republican, not Democrat
trump, We are reversing decades of calamitous trade policies that decimated manufacturing all across your state and all across our country
trump, For years, politicians sold you out to global special interests, enriching other countries at your expense
trump, That ended
trump, That ended
trump, But I am not the president of the globe
trump, I don't want to be the president of the world
trump, I am the president of the United States of America
trump,  reciprocal
trump, Reciprocal
trump, Got to be fair
trump, After years of building up other countries, we are finally rebuilding our country
trump, We are finally putting America first
trump, On no issue of Washington Democrats more thoroughly sold out the American people than the issue of immigration
trump, Every Democrat running for president supports free federal welfare for illegal aliens funded by you, the American taxpayer
trump, They want to treat illegal aliens, people that come into our country illegally, better than they want to treat our military and our veterans
trump, Not only does illegal immigration drain our treasury, but it threatens innocent lives
trump, I recently invited to the White House the granddaughter of a 92 year old woman who was raped, beaten, brutalized, and murdered by an illegal alien who had previously been set free in New York City
trump, Here in Charleston County, an illegal alien was recently charged with sexually assaulting a young girl in the fourth grade
trump, In Berkeley County, officers captured a previously deported MS-13 gang member who shot a man to death before dousing the body in gasoline and setting him on fire
trump, And he should have never been in our country
trump, He shouldn't have been allowed
trump, It's being built
trump, It's being built
trump, By the way, just in case you haven't heard, it is being built
trump, That, you know
trump, And they're going to go nuts
trump, They're going to go nuts
trump, They thought they got me
trump, They said, Okay
trump, Have you heard them recently Okay
trump, He's building the wall
trump, And you think it's easy getting that kind of money to build a wall when I have a whole party and a deep State and some never-Trumpers They're a dying breed though
trump, The good thing, they're on respirator
trump, They're on respirator
trump, They're on mouth to mouth resuscitation
trump, You can do it
trump, I'm not doing it
trump, They're on mouth to mouth resuscitation, the never-Trumpers
trump, But you think it's easy
trump, It's not
trump, But that's been built
trump, But you know what they say now
trump, Okay
trump, He's building the wall, but Mexico's not paying for it
trump, Yes they are, actually
trump, They are
trump, They are
trump, They are paying for it
trump, And some of the fake news knows that, but they refuse to report it, but that's okay
trump, You'll see
trump, You'll see what's going on
trump, And I want to thank Mexico because, by the way, right now they have 27,000 soldiers on our border protecting our border
trump, We have Mexico protecting our border
trump, And they only do that for Trump
trump, They don't do that for sleepy Joe
trump, They don't do that for crazy Bernie
trump, And they don't do it for mini Mike, that's for sure
trump, They're only doing that for Trump, right 27,000 soldiers protecting our border
trump, In this region … … thousand soldiers protecting our border
trump, In this region of the country alone last year, ICE … They've been treated so badly, right They are great
trump, They're brave
trump, They're tough
trump, Any men There are tough guys in here, but anybody want to be an ICE officer It's tough stuff, right They go into those nests
trump, They call them nest
trump, That's where these guys get together and they knock the hell
trump, I mean, if they have to … I have to be very careful
trump, I don't want to get them in trouble, because the press wants us to be very politically correct
trump, So let me change it around
trump, They go into a nest of MS13, and they say, Oh, hello gentlemen
trump, How are you On occasion, they have a fight
trump, They never lose those fights
trump, We need people like that
trump, Hello gentleman
trump, How are you How many people did you kill last year How many people did you get kill last year with a knife, because they like knives because it's more painful
trump, This is the kind of people that we were letting into our country
trump, ICE has taken them out of our country by the thousands
trump, By the thousands
trump, Last year, ICE officers arrested 12,000 criminal aliens charged or convicted of dangerous offenses, including robbery, rape and many for a thing called murder
trump, On Wednesday we won the big case in federal court
trump, Did you see that Did you see that We won the case unanimously
trump, Unanimously
trump, Federal appeals court, where we don't have to give money to sanctuary cities and States if they don't work with us, finally
trump, Finally
trump, Finally
trump, Why should we Yet the Democrat candidates oppose all detention of illegal aliens
trump, They want unfettered catch and release
trump, We have ended that program
trump, It was not easy
trump, We have to go through courts
trump, Everything is a court
trump, Everything is a suit
trump, We do anything
trump, We turn to the right, they sue us
trump, We turn to the left, they sue us
trump, We win
trump, But we're winning
trump, We have 218 judges now
trump, It's good
trump, Let me just preface that by saying I know they give fair opinions
trump, It bears no relationship to who appoints them, but I never win with an Obama appointed judge ever
trump, I don't win
trump, No, we have great judges going onto the courts
trump, Great judges
trump, They're fair judges
trump, They're judges that truly love our constitution
trump, It's great
trump, They're judges that if we feel it's right, they don't want to invite the world to trespass across our borders
trump, Very simple
trump, The democrat field also supports deadly sanctuary cities that release violet criminal aliens
trump, You know that
trump, You've been reading
trump, All you have to do is pick up a paper every day
trump, They release these horrible criminals to terrorize our communities
trump, We don't do that anymore
trump, We won't let it happen, and now we don't have to give sanctuary cities and states the money that they're going to want
trump, It's a whole game changer
trump,  I don't think he's doing a good job
trump, This guy doesn't know he's alive
trump, Oh, what bad people
trump, Republicans believe America should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens
trump, Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, we have reduced illegal border crossings by a staggering 75 since last spring, and we have ended catch and release permanently
trump, You know what catching release is We catch them, we grab them
trump, We say, Could we please have your address Address I don't know what the hell is an address They don't have an address
trump, Could we have a number Do you have a phone Could we call your mother or your father and say in four years you have to come to court
trump, What they do is they catch him, they get some information that the guy has no idea where he lives, and it's one of those things in many cases, and then release
trump, We release him into our country
trump, We don't do that anymore
trump, If you knew what it took … We catch them, and we take some information and we release them in, and we say, Please report back in four years from now for your trial
trump, About 2 come back, and they're the ones that are the dumbest people I've ever seen
trump, 2
trump, Nobody comes back
trump, It's crazy, but we're getting a change
trump, It would be so easy
trump, They call it loopholes
trump, Loopholes
trump, That word alone, they call it loopholes
trump, It would be so easy if we had some democrat support
trump, We don't have any Democrat support
trump, They want open borders
trump, They don't care about crime
trump, Border Patrol has seized the largest amount of deadly narcotics ever in the history of our country this last year
trump, We have deported record numbers of gang members
trump, We are building the wall faster than ever, and we will soon be rebuilding more than one mile a day
trump, Washington democrats have never been more extreme
trump, 132 congressional democrats have signed up for Bernie Sanders' healthcare takeover
trump, They want to take away your healthcare
trump, While the Washington Democrats are trying to destroy your healthcare and to destroy your social security
trump, That's what's going to happen
trump, My administration is protecting your social security, your Medicare, and is fighting to give you great healthcare
trump, We are defending your right to keep the doctor and to keep your plan of choice
trump, Remember when President Obama would say, You can keep your doctor
trump, You could keep your plan
trump, 28 times
trump, He said, You can keep your doctor and you can keep your plan
trump, Well, he lied
trump, We should impeach him
trump, We should impeach him for that
trump, He lied 28 times
trump, You'll keep your doctor, keep your plan
trump, It's wonderful
trump, Great
trump, Went through the roof
trump, We're doing a great job
trump, We killed the individual mandate, which is the most unbelievable, horrible
trump, It's not really Obamacare anymore, but we're running the hulk of it and we're trying to kill it entirely, and then we will put it back
trump, You'll have great health care, and preexisting conditions will be totally protected
trump, Preexisting conditions will be totally protected
trump, We're making healthcare better and much cheaper
trump, While premiums more than doubled in the five years before I took office, we are now offering plans already that are up to 60 less expensive than the old Obamacare
trump, Think of that and better
trump, And better
trump, We are stopping surprise medical billing, a disgrace
trump, I signed an executive order imposing price transparency, because when providers are required to show their prices, which they don't have to do, but now they do, those same prices fall very, very fast
trump, We have approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs, which are just as good as the name brand drugs, but at a tiny fraction of the cost
trump, They're just as good
trump, I always like a name brand
trump, I mean, there's something
trump, There's no difference
trump, Probably sometimes they're better
trump, We've totally transformed veteran's healthcare, getting long ought VA choice and VA accountability passed after 50 years
trump,  the spectacular right to try
trump, You know what that is If you're terminally ill, you go all over the world
trump, If you have no money, you can't
trump, You go home and you die
trump, You're terminally ill
trump, They go all over the world
trump, If they have money, they go to Asia, they go to Europe
trump, They're searching
trump, We have the greatest doctors in the world, the greatest labs in the world, greatest technicians in the world, and we have pipelines of drugs coming out for different problems
trump, Now, you sign a piece of paper
trump, We're not going to hold anybody liable
trump, You get to use that drug, and the results have been unbelievable
trump, Unbelievable
trump, Hopefully you don't need it, but now we have right to try
trump, They've been trying for 51 years to get that approved
trump, 51 years, and we got it approved
trump, I guess I'm good at getting things approved, aren't I Those people that I brought up here where the reason too, every one of them
trump, They were incredible
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you
trump, Senators, Congressman, they were the reasons
trump, We are combating the opioid epidemic
trump, Drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 32 years
trump, We have launched new initiatives combating kidney disease, which is a big deal
trump, Kidney disease is so tough that people die literally because it's so much work
trump, They die from overwork
trump, It's just crazy
trump, In theory, they could keep them going for a long time, but the work and the dialysis and all of the things they have to do
trump, We've done things that make it so much easier, and it's just such an honor to be involved
trump, Also, Alzheimer's disease, we're really making strides
trump, It's really a great thing
trump, Great thing
trump, we're pursuing new advances in neonatal research to care for America's youngest patients and breaking all records in so doing
trump, Virtually every Democrat candidate has declared their unlimited support for extreme late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up until the very moment of birth
trump, That is why I've asked Congress to prohibit late term abortion of babies, because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift of God
trump, The Democrat Party is the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, blatant corruption, and the total obliteration of your second amendment
trump, The Republican Party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and of course the late, great Abraham Lincoln
trump, Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background, every community, and every walk of life
trump, We are the party of boundless optimism, excitement, energy and enthusiasm
trump, We are a big tent
trump, We are a big party
trump, We are the party of big ideas for the future
trump, This is where it is
trump, This is where it is
trump, this is not the old Republican Party
trump, This is a very inclusive party
trump, This is a great party
trump, Republicans are proudly fighting for nationwide school choice, including right here in South Carolina
trump, We want to give school choice to every child in America who needs it, from kindergarten to 12th grade, because no parent should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school
trump, I passed criminal justice reform to give former prisoners a second chance at life
trump, That's a big deal
trump, This could not have been done by anyone but the Republican Party
trump, They came to me, a group of people, and they wanted criminal justice reform
trump, I wasn't sure about the issue, but we had a lot of great Republicans, very much in favor of it, including people that happen to be right here today
trump, They were very much, and I started studying the issue, worked hard on the issue, and criminal justice reform
trump, You saw Alice Johnson come out of prison
trump, 22 years
trump, She had another 20 years left
trump, Think of it
trump, For a phone call
trump, For a phone call
trump, A great woman, but we have many people coming out that shouldn't be there for anywhere near those terms
trump, Not for those terms
trump, But they came to see me, a group
trump, A group of people came
trump, Van Jones, he came up
trump, Oh, thank you, sir
trump, They needed four senators
trump, They needed help
trump, I called Lindsey, I called everybody
trump, I called Tim, who's so great on everything
trump, I called everybody
trump, They needed four senators and maybe five, and they needed help with some of the ones that weren't moving in the right direction
trump, I gave it to them, and I got it, and it was not easy
trump, We get criminal justice reform, and then I signed it
trump, Then this Van Jones has a program that gets no ratings absolutely at all
trump, They say, Van Jones wants to thank everybody for criminal justice reform
trump, I called our great first lady over
trump, I said, Darling, please take a look
trump, It's going to be so nice, because honestly, look, they couldn't have done even close without me
trump, I got all these people together, got them done
trump, It was impossible
trump, Previous presidents couldn't even think about it
trump, They couldn't even think about doing it, and they tried, although I don't think they tried too hard, bur they could have never done it
trump, So he gets up, and he starts by saying, I want to thank the Reverend Al Sharpton
trump, I knew Al when he was very heavy
trump, He looked better when he was heavy
trump, It's true
trump, He's one of the few people, he really looked better when he was heavy
trump, He looked much better when he was heavy
trump, I've got to tell him
trump, I have to explain, because I know him very well
trump, He would admit that he has a lot of respect for your president, but he can't admit it on television
trump, But he called and he said, I want to take the Reverend Al Sharpton, and then name after name after name of people that I never heard of
trump, My wife said, Are they going to think about you, right Are they going to think about you I said, Darling, of course
trump, I said, He's saving me til the end, because I was by far
trump, It's true
trump, This is true, Tim
trump, Lindsay, this is true
trump, I said, He's saving me til the end
trump, It's going to be such an honor to be recognized, because I don't get enough publicity
trump, I need a little bit more
trump, He got to the end and he didn't say it, and she looked at me
trump, She sort of smiled
trump, I think she loved it in a certain way
trump, But she sort of smiled
trump, She said, That's too bad
trump, I said, Yeah, it is
trump, Then he said, I have one more thing to say
trump, We must get out this year and fight and vote against this President of the United States
trump, Can you believe that It's true It's a true story
trump, Van Jones
trump, These are just terrible that they could … I was a little embarrassed in front of our great first lady, but I'll live through it somehow
trump, I recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem
trump, We recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights
trump, 52 years
trump, 52 years that Golan Heights had been fighting and fighting for it
trump, I did it, and I did the true capital, Jerusalem, right How many presidents promise that Every president for many, many decades promised we're going to do that
trump, They never did it
trump, I did it
trump, We did a lot
trump, We've invested more than 2 trillion in the United States military, including more than 150 million this year in Joint Base Charleston, Fort Jackson, and Paris Island
trump, We created the sixth branch of the American Armed Forces, the Space Force
trump, We have another branch
trump, 72 years
trump, Not for 72 years, the Air Force, have they done a new branch
trump, We did the Space Force
trump, When I first said it, everybody thought I was joking
trump, I said, I'm not joking
trump, They thought it was from the comic strips or the future movies
trump, I said, No, it's all about space
trump, In a number of years, people are going to say, I can't believe we didn't do this sooner
trump, We need a little vision
trump, We need a little foresight
trump, You know what I mentioned Space Force
trump, At arenas like this, it gets one of the biggest hands, because that's where it's at
trump, That's where it's going, unfortunately, or fortunately
trump, We needed it for defense
trump, We needed it for offense
trump, Sixth branch
trump, 72 years
trump, For years, we watched as your politicians apologize for America
trump, Now you have a president who is standing up for America, and we are standing up for the people of South Carolina
trump, At stake in our present battle is the actual survival of our nation
trump, I really believe that it's the survival
trump, You see these maniacs that we're dealing with
trump, They want to give away everything
trump, We will end up being Venezuela large scale version
trump, If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for, to secure, then we must devote everything we have towards a victory in November of 2020, November 3rd to be exact
trump, Only this way can we save the America we love and drain the swamp
trump, I never thought it was this deep
trump, Man
trump, I talked about a swamp
trump, You never told me it was this bad, fellas
trump, That swamp is bad
trump, You got dirty cops at the top of the FBI
trump, You got a lot of dirty people, but you also have phenomenal people in the FBI and other places, but we're draining that swamp
trump, I never knew it was going to be this dirty, and we're getting a lot of help from a lot of great people
trump, With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity
trump, That's what's happening
trump, Think of it
trump, From poverty to prosperity
trump, Look at some of the stories that you have over there
trump, Look at some of the incredible stories
trump, Look at Tim Scott
trump, Look at that incredible story
trump, No, really
trump, It's an incredible story
trump, Lindsay will say it
trump, I give about 99 of the credit to Tim Scott's mother
trump, I do
trump, I guarantee you, Tim, there was no games, right There was no games in your household
trump, It was let's go to work, right Great mother
trump, Thank you very much
trump, Thank you
trump, Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system finally of immigration
trump, We will continue to enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with beautiful phrase, Made in the USA
trump, We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer, infectious diseases like we're working on right now, and ending the AIDS epidemic
trump, Nobody thought this was possible in less now than nine years, and it should have been started before
trump, We will end the AIDS epidemic
trump, Who would have thought we could have done that We will land the first woman on the moon and become the first nation in the world to plant our flag on Mars
trump, You have to land on moon, and then you go to Mars
trump, We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms
trump, Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America
trump, We support, protect and defend the constitution of the United States
trump, We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement
trump, We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life
trump, We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way
trump, We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag, and we live by the words of our national motto, In God we trust
trump, From Greenville to Columbia and from Myrtle Beach to Hilton Head to right here in Charleston, this state is home to some of the toughest men and strongest women ever to walk on the face of the earth
trump, It's true
trump, It's true
trump, True
trump, We stand on the shoulders of American Patriots who have crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, lay down the railroads, revolutionized industry, liberated millions from poverty, hunger and disease, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world, and we are making it greater every single day
trump, Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country
trump, We are returning power to you, the American people
trump, With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning
trump, You have the best year ever on record, right Southeast, best year you've ever had, right You have a great governor, you have two senators, great congressman, the greatest year you've ever had, but some people in South Carolina are getting a little tired, I'm surprised to hear this, of winning
trump, I've very surprised to hear this
trump, Some actually called in two great senators into a big meeting, a town hall, and they said, Senator Scott, Senator Lindsay Graham, we're tired of winning and South Carolina
trump, Can't do it anymore
trump, It's too much
trump, It's too much
trump, We've had years where we weren't winning, and it was okay
trump, We couldn't get jobs
trump, We took it easy, but we just want you to go and see your friend, the president, and we want you to represent us
trump, We want you to say, ‘Mr
trump, President, South Carolina is tired of winning
trump, We don't want to win anymore
trump, We are tired, sick, tired of winning
trump,' They're going to come in and say, Sir, I hate to tell you, but the people of South Carolina don't want to win anymore
trump, I'll say, Mr
trump, Senators, let me tell you something
trump, South Carolina does want to win
trump, They want to win more than anybody, and we're not going to change a thing, because we're winning like never before
trump, You know what We're going to keep it that way
trump, Sorry, senators
trump, Go back to South Carolina, senators
trump, Go back to South Carolina, because we are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God
trump, America is thriving like never before, and ladies and gentlemen of South Carolina, the best is yet to come
trump, The best is yet to come
trump, The best is yet to come, because together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again
trump, Thank you, South Carolina
trump, Thank you
trump,
trump,I want to thank you very much
trump, North Carolina, thank you very much
trump, I'm thrilled to back in the great city of Charlotte, where, by the way, we're having our convention
trump, I guess you heard that, right With thousands of hardworking American patriots who love our country, cherish our values, respect our laws and always put America first
trump, Eight months from now, we're going to defeat the radical socialists
trump, We're going to win the great state of North Carolina in a landslide
trump, We won it last time, we're going to win it this time by even more
trump, And you know, Eric and Lara named their daughter, you know what her name is Carolina, Carolina
trump, Her name is Carolina for a reason
trump, This is an incredible time for our nation
trump, Our country is stronger than ever before
trump, And today, we just had the largest one day increase in the stock market in history
trump, That's great
trump, That's great
trump, That was great
trump, You know, our opponents were saying,  Oh, maybe he's in trouble, maybe the economy …  They'll do anything
trump, They'll do anything
trump, I'm sure they were thrilled
trump, Do you think our opponents were thrilled when they saw the stock market today I don't think so
trump, By the way, look at this
trump, Look back there, look at all of that press
trump, Look at all them
trump, Man, I don't know if Sleepy Joe, or Bernie, I don't think they have that much press
trump, Bernie was going wild
trump, Why would I be here tonight Why would I be here He said why would I be here tonight We don't have the primary, we've already won the thing, you know I was going to say the you know what thing, I held it back, because they'll say, Horrible language
trump, He used horrible language today
trump, But we're doing fantastically
trump, There's never been a time where the Republican Party was so unified as it is now
trump, Never, never
trump, And you hear about enthusiasm for crazy Bernie, and that's true, he does have some enthusiasm, but much less than we have and a much smaller group of people, too
trump, And there's not a lot of enthusiasm for Biden
trump, I thought he gave up the presidency the other day because he said he's running for the Senate
trump, I looked at the First Lady, I said,  Hey, he's running for the Senate
trump, And today he just said Super Thursday, he's looking forward to Super Thursday
trump, Jobs are booming in our country, incomes are soaring, poverty has plummeted, confidence is surging, and we have completely rebuilt the awesome power of a thing called the United States military
trump, Every day, for me and for you, it's promises made, promises kept
trump, One of the most important promises I made is right to this era
trump, You know, we look at it, it's the never ending wars in the Middle East
trump, We're taking our soldiers, we're bringing them back home
trump, We're not law enforcement
trump, We're bringing them back home
trump, American troops cannot be the policemen for the world, or to create democracy in other nations that frankly probably don't want it
trump, The job of the American military is to secure and defend our country
trump, Two days ago, the Unites States signed a deal with the Taliban so that after 19 years of conflict, and very close to 20, we can finally begin to bring our amazing troops back home
trump, After years of rebuilding foreign nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation and taking care of our own American citizens And all of the things that we've done, we've wiped out the terrorists, we've done so much, and you know what We're 8,000 miles away
trump, You got a lot of big countries surrounding Afghanistan, you've got Afghanistan itself
trump, The progress that was made, was made possible by the extraordinary valor of our men and our women in uniform
trump, You know that
trump, We pay a special tribute, and I know you pay it, a special tribute to our great wounded warriors and those who made the ultimate sacrifice
trump, As we bring back our troops, we are committed to ensuring that foreign terrorists are denied admission to America in the first place
trump, They're not coming here, and if they do, bad things happen to them
trump, We must keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country
trump, By the way, I have to say this, you know you have thousands and thousands of people outside
trump, Somebody was saying that if Pocahontas, any one of them, Sleepy Joe, he doesn't have that, so he doesn't have a lot, he has very small crowds, but if Sleepy Joe or if any of them had a crowd one-tenth this size, they go around talking about how big the crowd
trump, They never say that
trump, Hey, take your cameras and spin them around this big arena
trump, Right now
trump, Spin them around
trump, No fun to be a protestor at a Trump rally, but do we have a great time at a Trump rally My administration has also taken the most aggressive action in modern history to protect Americans from the Coronavirus
trump, You know about this whole thing Horrible
trump, Including, sweeping travel restrictions
trump, Today, we met with the big great pharmaceutical companies, and they're really working hard, and they're working smart, and we had a great meeting today with a lot of the great companies
trump, They're going to have vaccines I think relatively soon
trump, And they're going to have something that makes you better, and that's going to actually take place we think even sooner
trump, So a lot of good things are happening, but we have strong borders, and really, our tough and early actions have really been proven to be 100 right
trump, We went out, we're doing everything in our power to keep the sick and infected people from coming into our country
trump, We're working on that very hard
trump, We closed our borders very early
trump, I took a lot of heat for that
trump, Remember when I closed the borders to certain areas of the world I took a lot of heat
trump, But there are fringe globalists who would rather keep our borders open than keep our infection, think of it, keep all of the infection, let it come in
trump, And we're working with other countries
trump, In all fairness, look, it's a problem, we're working with other countries
trump, Remember this, over the last long period of time, the flu, the common flu, you know this, right From 27,000 to 70,000 people get infected, and many people die
trump, Think of it, 27,000
trump, You lose 27,000 people to the common flu
trump, It can be much more
trump, One year was much higher than the 70,000 number
trump, Those people died
trump, So when you lose 27,000 people a year, nobody knew that
trump, I didn't know that
trump, Three, four weeks ago, I was sitting there, I said, What do we lose with the regular flu They said, About 27,000 minimum, goes up to 70, sometimes even 80, one year it went up to 100,000 people
trump, I said, Nobody told me that
trump, Nobody knows that
trump, Last year was approximately 36,000 people died
trump, So we're working hard on it, and we're going to come up with some really great solutions
trump, In the meantime, we're stopping … Only in North Carolina
trump, Only in North Carolina
trump, It can only be
trump, How many people here are from South Carolina, by the way All right, we love both places
trump, But that was from North Carolina
trump, But just to finish up, so we've made a lot of progress, we've really done a great job with it
trump, We're keeping our borders strong
trump, My job is to protect the health of American patients and Americans first, and that's what I'll do
trump, Washington Democrats are trying to politicize the coronavirus, denigrating the noble work of our public health professionals
trump, But honestly, not so much anymore
trump, Everyone appreciates, these are the greatest professionals in the world at what they do
trump, We're actually helping a lot of other countries where they have some very, very big problems
trump, So we have our professionals in constant touch, I'm in constant touch with some of the leaders and helping them out
trump, But the political attacks from some of the Democrats really must stop
trump, We've got to all work together on this one to safeguard our people
trump, We're going to safeguard our people, the United States
trump, The United States is, right now, ranked by far number one in the world for preparedness
trump, Earlier today, when I met with the pharmaceutical companies, things were discussed and learned honestly
trump, The media didn't know
trump, Nobody knew
trump, They've never heard this before
trump, And we learned a lot, and maybe that had the impact on the stock market
trump, Who knows what happened, but we're going to reduce and the severity of what's happening, the duration of the virus
trump, We discussed all of these things
trump, We will bring these therapies to market as rapidly as possible
trump, And I have to say, with a thriving economy the way it is, and the most advanced health system on earth, America is so resilient, we know what we're doing, we have the greatest people on earth, the greatest health system on earth
trump, We have the greatest health system on earth
trump, The renewal of American strength over the last three years means at times of challenge, we are the best prepared to rise to any occasion
trump, No country is better equipped than America to handle new threats, and no people are more skilled, talented, tough, or driven than Americans
trump, And together, we are in the midst of the great American comeback
trump, That's what it is
trump, Last month, we added 225,000 new jobs in January alone
trump, That makes seven million jobs since the election
trump, We have destroyed the ISIS territorial caliphate, and we killed the founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi
trump, He is dead
trump, And we took out the world's top terrorist, Qasem Soleimani, ending his evil reign on terror forever, Soleimani
trump, While the extreme left has been wasting time with vile hoaxes and delusional witch hunts, we have been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, and lifting up American citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed
trump, Tomorrow, voters in states across the nation will head to the polls for Super Tuesday, not Super Thursday
trump, No, he said, Super Thursday
trump, You can't do these things
trump, Can you imagine if I said Super Thursday It would be over, right I would be over
trump, No matter how good you are at certain things, you can't, as an example, a name like Sleepy Joe, he's constantly naming the wrong state
trump, It's great to be in the state of Ohio
trump, No, no, no, I'm sorry, you're in North Carolina
trump, No, no
trump, Joe Do you ever see them run up with a sign, No, no, North Carolina, Joe Once that happens, you might as well leave the states, because it's a disaster no matter how good you're doing
trump, We're in North Carolina It's great to be in Idaho No, you're in Iowa
trump, Nah, he makes a lot of those mistakes, they're a little scary We're going to protect your second amendment, you understand that
trump, But did you see, Sleepy Joe, did you see Sleepy Joe, where he said, Last year, 150 million people were killed by guns in our country
trump, 150 million That means 50 of our country
trump, That's a big story
trump, 150
trump, Can you imagine Trump saying that These people would never let me live it down
trump, We can't make even a little mistake
trump, We can't make even a little, tiny, tiny mistake
trump, If we make a tiny mistake, it's headlining
trump, They say things like 150 million people killed, guns, they say Super Thursday, they say Georgia, he's looking forward to winning Georgia tomorrow
trump, Georgia's not in Super Tuesday So many mistakes You can't do that when you're negotiating with China
trump, Can't do that when you're negotiating with these countries, can you Those mistakes would be very tremendous
trump, Then you have Mini Mike
trump, You see this guy Can you believe it Mini Mike
trump, He's being interviewed tonight on Fox
trump, Can you believe it Fox
trump, They want to be politically correct
trump, They want to interview, they end up interviewing more Democrats than Republic … I don't know what's going on with Fox
trump, But they're interviewing this guy the night before … Mini Mike, ay, ay, ay, what a mess he is
trump, The worst debate performance in the history of presidential debate history
trump, The worst in history
trump, Nah, I got to have more
trump, I'd get down real low, but I don't want to copy him
trump, Everybody saw it
trump, Everyone said, Oh, they all say, Oh Do that again where you get down low
trump, But if I do that again, it's a copy
trump, It's a copy No, no
trump, No
trump, You never like to copy, even though you're copying yourself
trump, You don't like to copy
trump, You do it once
trump, It was a big hit
trump, But you do it once, and you sort of say, That was nice, don't do it again, because if it doesn't work the second time, it gets embarrassing, right Right We all know
trump, But no, he's a disaster waiting to happen
trump, He's a mess
trump, No matter which Democrat candidate you're talking about, and you understand that, any one of these candidates … And you see what's happening, right It's being rigged against … It's sad
trump, It's being rigged against Crazy Bernie
trump, Crazy Bernie is going to go crazy
trump, Crazy
trump, I think Crazy Bernie is going to be more crazy when they see what they're doing
trump, I called it a long time ago
trump, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Buttigieg, May Pete, he quit
trump, Out last night
trump, Then I hear a Senator from a state we're going to win, we're going to win that state, but she dropped out
trump, Sounds like they made a deal
trump, They both supported Sleepy Joe
trump, You know why They made a deal
trump, You know why Quid pro quo, that's why
trump, Don't care
trump, Quid pro quo
trump, Quid pro quo, they made a deal
trump, Impeach them They should be impeached They should be impeached Quid pro quo
trump, But they've embraced an extreme left wing agenda
trump, Their plans would massively raise your taxes, destroy our liberty, muzzle our faith, and erase our sovereignty
trump, You know that
trump, The Democrat Party has gone crazy
trump, Whether it's Bernie Sanders plan to eliminate private healthcare, Elizabeth Pocahontas's plan … By the way, she's history
trump, She's history
trump, I came up with that name far too early, I should've just waited
trump, But it didn't matter
trump, I thought she was making a come back
trump, I said, Wow, I just did it to her
trump, But you know those embers were burning a little bit a couple of months ago They never caught on
trump, In fact, she'll probably lose the State of Massachusetts to Bernie
trump, So she doesn't know what to do because you're not supposed to lose the State of Massachusetts if you get in there
trump, She's the Senator
trump, She's the Senator for Massachusetts, I think she's going to lose it to Bernie
trump, And Miss Michigan, you see what's going on over there Michigan, we're leading
trump, We're leading in Wisconsin
trump, We're leading in Florida
trump, We're leading in the last election
trump, Hey, how great was the 2016 election One of the greatest nights, one of the most highest rated television nights in the history of television
trump, And remember, there was oh, this is going to be a quick one
trump, This is going to be… oh, that wasn't so easy for them
trump, I love the scene
trump, The scene of that convention center where Hillary was getting ready to speak, and then she found out she lost
trump, But Elizabeth Warren's here to plan to eliminate our borders, or Mini Mike's plan to eliminate your second amendment
trump, Mike Bloomberg wants to eliminate your second amendment
trump, Don't worry about it, it's not going to happen
trump, Not going to happen for him
trump, For sleepy Joe, he doesn't even know where he is, what he's doing, or what office he's running for
trump, Actually, I honestly don't think he knows what office he's running for
trump, And it doesn't matter
trump, Maybe he gets in, because he's a little more moderate
trump, So maybe he gets in
trump, But he's not going to be running it
trump, Other people are going to
trump, They're going to put him into a home, and other people are going to be running the country
trump, But they're going to be super left radical crazies
trump, They're going to be super left radical crazies, Joe's going to be in a home
trump, He'll be watching television
trump, Everything will be just fine
trump, The insanity of Washington Democrats is why millions of registered Democrat voters are joining our movement
trump, They are joining our great Republican party
trump, We have the enthusiasm in our party
trump, No, I really mean it
trump, I constantly hear about the enthusiasm
trump, They're fighting each other, they hate each other, they don't know what's going on
trump, We have all the love, we have all the enthusiasm, and we know what we're doing
trump, We know what we're doing
trump, So we're thrilled to be joined tonight by many really great, terrific, brilliant, wonderful warriors
trump, Even though he comes from a slightly different state, but not to far by, is somebody that really has distinguished himself, he's become a great friend of mine
trump, What he did for Justice Kavanaugh, do you remember that One of the greatest statements ever made in the United State's Senate, Senator Lindsey Graham
trump, Come on up, Lindsey
trump, Lindsey Graham, come on up, Lindsey
trump, Come here, Lindsey
trump, I got to have him say something, come here, Lindsey, great guy
trump, They handle pressure so well
trump, They came and we gave a rally that was like this and Dan Bishop and Gregg Murphy won by so much, it wasn't even close
trump, They're great people, and they've done a fantastic job
trump, Thank you very much
trump, They handle pressure
trump, They were under a lot of pressure, they handled it well
trump, It's nice to know people can handle pressure, there aren't too many of them
trump, North Carolina Republican party chairman Michael Whatley
trump, Thank you, Michael
trump, I have a few great friends of mine and they love North Carolina
trump, Louis DeJoy, who you know, Louis DeJoy
trump, Two great people, diamond and silk
trump, Right Diamond and silk
trump, We love them
trump, You know the first lady, a long time ago now, right How long is that Probably almost almost five years ago, she said, There are these two women on the internet, they're unbelievable
trump, They're unbelievable
trump, I said, Oh, I know, I hear that all the time
trump, I hear it all the time
trump, She said, the next day she came again
trump, She said, I saw them again, they're unbelievable
trump, I said, Let me see
trump, I saw them, I fell in love with it, and everybody fell in love with Diamond and Silk
trump, So thank you
trump, Some people that have really been helpful to me, Corey Lewandowski, David Bussey, and Pam Bondi, right here
trump, Thanks also to all of the people who are working to make the 2020 Republican National Convention right here in Charlotte an outstanding success, RNC chairman Ronna McDaniel, RNC co chairman Tommy Hicks, and Convention president Marcia Lee Kelly, thank you all
trump, You're doing a great job, I'll tell you they're looking, they're going to spend a lot of money and doing a good job
trump, Should we doing a great job, but just an okay job It doesn't matter as long as you win
trump, You know what I gave when we won last time, somebody else took them to convention center, spent a fortune and I just took a hotel ballroom
trump, I said, What the heck, if I win, nobody cares, if I don't
trump, Look if you win, nobody cares what room you're in
trump, If you lose, nobody cares what room you're in
trump, So we took a ballroom, nice ballroom, that's it, no big deal
trump, I think it this way, if we win, nobody cares
trump, And if we lose, I'm out of there, I save a hell of a lot of money
trump, Every place that we've gone, it's been amazing
trump, I'd also like to recognize, so important, a woman who's really helped us win North Carolina in 2016, I have a feeling this year, she'll even do better, because she happened to grow up here, Lara Trump and my son Eric Trump
trump, Two great people
trump, I mean I have to say that about my son, but I know a lot of people don't like their sons that much, but Lara has been fantastic, and thank you very much, what a job
trump, She knows this state better than anybody in this room except maybe this guy right here
trump, How are we doing, Lara How are we doing How are we doing in the state, are we doing good And we're doing well in Pennsylvania I hear, and South Carolina, I know we're doing great there
trump, Also with us tonight, is a man who's really become a good friend of mine
trump, We were going at it a little bit at the beginning, but I will tell you, and I would say if I didn't get along, I would not be here
trump, I wouldn't do this
trump, I think he's been tremendous
trump, He's been a tremendous supporter and things that we've wanted to do, and fights that we've had which were so important, he's been right up, and Lizzie will tell you that he's been right up in front and really he deserves another six year term
trump, Probably a lot longer than that, but he's going to come up and I'm going to ask Senator Thom Tillis, come on up
trump, Thom has really been incredible, he's been working everyday
trump, And he really wants to fight to the radical left and he does it and he knows how to fight, and take care of our amazing veterans, and stop illegal immigration
trump, Thom is the champion for the people of North Carolina
trump, This November, we need everybody to go and vote for Thom, he's doing great
trump, He's doing great
trump, I hear he's way up in the polls, he's way up in the polls
trump, Thom, say a few words
trump, Get me off this stage
trump, Get me off
trump, You guys didn't tell me this was going to happen
trump, No, that was great Thom
trump, We're also honored to be joined tonight by a true American hero, a veteran of World War II and the Korean War who just turned 100 years old
trump, His name is George Washington Perry, legit
trump, George, thank you very much for being here
trump, Thank you, George
trump, 100 years
trump, He's 100 and he looks good
trump, Thank you, George
trump, With the help of everyone here tonight, America has now become the hottest economy anywhere on the planet earth
trump, Since my election over 219,000 new jobs have been created right here in North Carolina
trump, We have lifted 10,000,000 people off of welfare, including 7,000,000 people off of food stamps
trump, Median household income has reached the highest level ever recorded, think of that
trump, The average unemployment rate from my administration is the lowest for any US president in recorded history, that's happening, that's happening
trump, The unemployment rate among African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans has reached the lowest level in recorded history
trump, Very important to me, African American youth unemployment has reached an all time low
trump, African American poverty is that the lowest rate ever recorded
trump, For decades democratic politicians betrayed, and they truly did, they betrayed African Americans
trump, My administration is delivering for African Americans like never before
trump, No president has done more for our black community, no president has done more for our black community, and it's an honor to do it
trump, Last month here in Charlotte, we launched a nationwide campaign to create a better future for all Americans
trump, It's called Opportunity Now, you know about it
trump, We're also fighting to ensure that working families have access to paid family leave, reducing the cost of childcare and giving 40,000,000 american families an average of 2,200 thanks to the Republican child tax credit
trump, The Republicans are claiming that we did that nobody else did, but the Democrats are saying, How did they do that one
trump, The USMCA is a giant for North Carolina's incredible farmers and factory workers
trump, And by the way, speaking of farms, factory workers, and small businesses, are all for the death tax
trump, You know about the death tax, right It's called the inheritance tax
trump, You have a small farm some place, you have a small business, you have a nice business, you no longer have an inheritance tax or a death tax
trump, So if you want to leave it to your children, you can leave it to your children, there's no tax to be paid by your children
trump, So they don't have to go back to the evil banker, borrow money from the banker, lose the farm, lose the business, it won't happen
trump, And I always say, I know a lot of parents that don't love the children very much
trump, Is there anybody in this room that does not love your children Please raise your hand
trump, Please raise your hand
trump, Nobody
trump, Nobody, that's because we're North Carolina, you love your children
trump, But if you don't, then it doesn't matter because if you don't love your children, don't leave them a damn thing, but you don't have the inheritance tax anymore, which is great
trump, A lot of people don't even know that, but that's a big deal or no issue have Washington Democrats more thoroughly betraying the American people than on the issue of immigration sanctuary cities, which release dangerous criminals to terrorize your communities
trump, Right here in North Carolina, believe it or not, the sanctuary county of Durham released an illegal alien criminal, who then receded to viciously murdered a young 19 year old woman last year, you know all about it
trump, Killing her and dumping her body into the woods
trump, Last year alone, sanctuary jurisdictions in North Carolina, how did that happen to North Carolina Deliberately set free hundreds and hundreds of, and these are really dangerous criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of burglary, gun crime, sexual assault, kidnapping, and even suffering they inflict on our people
trump, We're building the wall
trump, We're building the wall
trump, We're building the wall
trump, We're building the wall
trump, Mexico's paying for the wall, by the way
trump, We built 127 miles as of today, 127
trump, Mexico is paying for the wall
trump, The media is going to be thrilled when I explain that Mexico is paying for the wall because you know, now finally they said I've had obstruction like you wouldn't believe
trump, The entire democratic party
trump, I could get anything
trump, I created Space Force
trump, I could do anything
trump, I could get
trump, Lindsey and Thom Tillis knows
trump, Mark knows this
trump, All of them knows this
trump, If I wanted 25 cents for the wall, they didn't want to get it
trump, They didn't want to do it, but now we got it, and you think that's easy Nobody else could have done this
trump, We're building it
trump, We're building our hearts away
trump, We'll soon be building many, many miles a week, but we're up to over 125, I guess 127, 28 by now, of the super duper wall, super duper
trump, I went to Border Patrol, I said,  What is your wish Well, sir, we'd like it to be steel and concrete
trump, They want it exactly what they have it, and the barriers up top, they want everything
trump, It's called a no climb provisor, no climb provisor
trump, I said, What does the word provisor mean They didn't know
trump, All it means is you're not able to climb over it
trump, It is very tough
trump, I don't know if you saw
trump, In a part of the wall, a couple of weeks ago, they were climbing the wall, and the fire department had to come and take them down
trump, That's what the no climb is
trump, That's what the no climb is
trump, It's a no climb
trump, It's more money
trump, It's a little more expensive
trump, Thank you
trump, Who is that What a voice
trump, Pavarotti
trump, So, we're building the wall
trump, It's going great
trump, So, they said, All right
trump, He's building the wall, but Mexico's not paying for it
trump, Yes, they are
trump, You'll see
trump, You'll see
trump, You understand
trump, Some of you understand because I told a few people last week, it got linked to the fake news media
trump, If you want to end sanctuary cities in North Carolina and across America, then you have only one choice
trump, You must vote Republican
trump, You have to
trump, You have to
trump, We've added catch and release, one of the worst loopholes you've ever seen, catch and release
trump, You catch them
trump, You then say, Where do you live They don't know because look, let's face it, they don't know
trump, I understand that
trump, It's not even to be laughed at
trump, They don't know
trump, Where do you live I don't know
trump, Mexico, maybe, Honduras, Guatemala, who knows El Salvador
trump, Where do you live Like this guy, he's a Mexican
trump, You're about as Mexican as I am
trump, Look at this guy
trump, He's as Mexican as I am
trump, Look at that hat
trump, Are you Mexican Are you Mexican No, you're not
trump, Are you He is
trump, It's like Elizabeth Warren
trump, She said she was an Indian
trump, I said, I have more Indian blood in me than you have, and I have none
trump, She said, Oh, this is terrible
trump, So she went out and got a test and it turned out not so good for her
trump, Right 1024th, right One thousandths, so I was right
trump, I probably have more in me
trump, What a phony she is
trump, What a phony
trump, Washington Democrats have never been more extreme
trump, 132 Congressional Democrats have signed up for Bernie Sanders' healthcare takeover
trump, While the Washington Democrats are trying to destroy your healthcare and your social security, and they are going to destroy your social security
trump, Remember they used to say with me, I'm going to end it the first day
trump, Well, you know what, we're going to soon be four years and all I've done is make it stronger
trump, You know that
trump, My administration is protecting your social security, your Medicare, and is fighting to give you great healthcare
trump, You're going to have great health
trump, We are defending your right to keep the doctor and to keep the plan of your choice
trump, Remember President Obama You can keep your doctor
trump, You can keep your plan
trump, 28 times
trump, They said, Impeach him
trump, You should impeach him
trump, 28 times he lied
trump, 28 times on record, You can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan
trump, Well, that's not true
trump, It wasn't
trump, Impeach him
trump, We're making healthcare better and much cheaper while premiums more than doubled in the last five years before I took office
trump, We are now offering plans that are up to 60 less expensive and they're better plans
trump, We are protecting people with preexisting conditions and we always will, and we are trying terminate, in the Supreme Court of the United States, the worst healthcare in the world, and we are going to give you the best healthcare you've ever seen at a low price and again, protecting preexisting conditions
trump, Protecting preexisting conditions
trump, We're fighting to stop surprise medical billing
trump, You know what that is Surprise
trump, You get all sorts of surprises
trump, We have people that take a blood test in one place, it's 26, and in another place it's 2000
trump, Same blood test, maybe the cheap one is better, who knows Same blood test
trump, It's wrong
trump, Surprise medical building
trump, Bombed
trump, Out
trump, Billing
trump, I signed an executive order opposing price transparency that's going to be bigger than healthcare, because when providers are required to show their prices, those same prices fall very, very fast
trump, Right It's a big thing
trump, It's a big thing
trump, We've approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs, which are just as good as name brand drugs, but a fraction of the cost
trump, We have given them, and there's a lot of political pressure not to do that, you can understand why
trump, To care for our amazing veterans, we passed VA Choice and VA Accountability, and nobody said it could be done
trump, So now, instead of waiting in line for days and days, and weeks and weeks to see a doctor, you go outside, you get a doctor, we pay the bill, you get all fixed up
trump, What a great thing
trump, It's called VA Choice
trump, I got it done
trump, They've been trying to pass it for almost 50 years and they haven't been able to
trump, Those people over there were a great help
trump, We have passed the spectacular Right to Try
trump, You know what that is Hopefully nobody in the room needs
trump, Hopefully nobody in the room needs Right to Try
trump, We are combating the opioid epidemic
trump, Drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 31 years
trump, We've launched new initiatives combating kidney disease and Alzheimer's, and we're pursuing new advances in neonatal research to care for America's youngest patients, and breaking all records in so doing
trump, Virtually every Democratic candidate has declared their unlimited support for extreme late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb, right up until the very moment of birth
trump, How about that That is why I've asked Congress to prohibit late term abortion of babies, because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift of God
trump, Then you have the Governor of Virginia
trump, The baby is born
trump, The baby is born and he says, And then you go over and start talking to the mother as to whether or not you execute the baby
trump, This is the Governor of Virginia
trump, The Governor of Virginia
trump, He's a beauty
trump, You remember what he did He wanted to dance like Michael Jackson and his wife stopped him
trump, He got lucky
trump, But the Governor of Virginia wanted to do that
trump, The baby is born and then he goes over and talks to the mother
trump, The doctor will now talk, and you'll make a decision as to whether or not the baby lives
trump, Did you ever hear of anything like this The Democratic party is the party of high taxes, high crime, unlimited regulations, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, blatant corruption, and the total obliteration of your second amendment
trump, The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and the late great Abraham Lincoln
trump, So many people came up to me tonight and they want me to fight, and we're doing it for school choice, so that every child who needs it, gets it
trump, No parent should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school
trump, I passed criminal justice reform to give former prisoners a second chance at life
trump, Alice Johnson, do we love Alice Johnson This could not have been done by anyone other than the Republican party
trump, I recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem
trump, We recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights
trump, Our historic investments in the United States military include 200 million to a place that nobody's heard of in this audience, I'm sure, Fort Bragg
trump, 300 million for Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point
trump, More than 500 million for Marine Corps Air Station New River
trump, Listen to this one
trump, No Democrat's going to this
trump, They don't even want to spend money on the military
trump, They don't like the military
trump, They're not going to spend money
trump, 1
trump,2 billion for Camp Lejeune
trump, 1
trump,2 billion
trump, Do you think that a guy like sleepy Joe's going to put, he doesn't know what it means
trump, I know what I means
trump, We have to have a strong military
trump, We have the strongest military we've ever had
trump, When I came in, our military was in sad shape
trump, It was depleted, but we've rebuilt it, 2
trump,5 trillion dollars went into our military
trump, 01 is the actual survival of an our nation itself
trump, If you want your children to inherit the blessings of generations of Americans who fought and died to secure, and you know what they're securing, they are securing us, they're securing our freedom, then we must devote everything we have toward victory in November, November 3rd to be exact
trump, Only this way can we save the America we love, and drain the Washington swamp, which is by the way, much more vicious, much dirtier, much deeper than I ever thought, but we are kicking ass
trump, With your help, we will lift billions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity
trump, Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane and lawful system of immigration, and we will continue with the great Thom Tillis
trump, We will get Thom Tillis
trump, Thom, I don't think anybody even wants to run against you, Thom, but we're going to reelect Thom Tillis
trump, Is that right We're going to reelect Thom Tillis
trump, If we don't, I'm going to be so angry at you
trump, I'll only come back here a few times a year
trump, No, Thom is going to be great
trump, Thom, I think you're in great shape
trump, I think you're in great shape
trump, One more hand for Thom Tillis, please
trump, We don't even know who's running against him
trump, Nobody wants the run
trump, We will continue to enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful, beautiful, beautiful phrase Made in the USA, right Made in the USA
trump, We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in less than nine years
trump, We've already started
trump, Who would have thought We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms
trump, Your second amendment rights are under siege
trump, Believe me, they're under siege
trump, We don't get in, you can forget your second amendment
trump, That's what I think
trump, I really believe it
trump, Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that binds us together as one beautiful America
trump, We support, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States
trump, We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement
trump, We believe in the dignity of work, and the sanctity of life
trump, We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way
trump, We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag
trump, We live by the words of our national motto, In God We Trust
trump, From Fayetteville to Wilmington, from Raleigh to Greensboro, from Asheville to Kitty Hawk, to right here in Charlotte, this state is the home to some of the toughest men and strongest women, and most incredible patriots ever to walk the face of the Earth
trump, We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the ocean, blazed the trail, sailed the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industry, won two world wars, defeated fascism, and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world, and we are making it greater every single day
trump, Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country
trump, We are returning power to you, the American people, that's what's happening
trump, With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning
trump, We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God
trump, America is thriving like never before, and ladies and gentlemen of North Carolina, the best is yet to come
trump, Because together, we have made America wealthy again
trump, We have made America strong again
trump, We have made America proud again
trump, We have made America safe again, and we have made America great again
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you, North Carolina
trump, Thank you
trump,
trump,Thank you all
trump, Thank you very much
trump, Thank you to Vice President Mike Pence, and hello Cincinnati
trump, You know, I used to work in Cincinnati, a place called Swifton Village
trump, You know what that is Swifton Village It was good and it worked out well, and it gives you confidence when things work out well at a young age, and look what happened to all of us, right Look what happened
trump, Look what happened
trump, I was watching the so-called debate last night, and I also watched the night before that was long, long television
trump, The Democrats spent more time attacking Barack Obama than they did attacking me practically
trump, This morning, that's all the fake news was talking about
trump, It's all they were talking about
trump, That wasn't pretty
trump, No, we're doing good
trump, It's great to be back in the state that I love
trump, I love this state
trump, Very special
trump, Very, very special, on the banks of the beautiful Ohio River with the hardworking patriots of the American heartland
trump, Thank you, Ohio
trump, We love you, Ohio
trump, We've got thousands of people standing outside, and I asked the officials can we sneak some up along the aisles Can they sit on the stairs But I'll tell you what, this is some crowd, some turnout
trump, We've sold tens of thousands of tickets
trump, And, you know what the sale price is We keep it nice and low
trump, We keep it nice and low
trump, But, there never has been a movement like this
trump, This is a movement the likes of which they've never seen before, maybe anywhere, but certainly in this country
trump, They've never seen anything like this before
trump, You came from the mountains and the valleys and the rivers, and you came for … I mean, look, from wherever you came from
trump, There were a lot of you
trump, And, they showed up on election day
trump, I'll never forget, a wonderful congressman from Tennessee
trump, They have early voting, and one of the earliest places, great state, Tennessee, and he was in Pennsylvania with me, great state
trump, And he said, You know, sir, I've been doing this for a long time, but I've never seen people like this show up for early voting
trump, People that haven't voted in a long time because they didn't see anybody they wanted to vote for
trump, He said, I've never seen it
trump, They have Trump banners, and Trump hats, and Trump buttons
trump, I've never seen it
trump, This great congressman said, I don't know, sir, but I can tell you one thing
trump, If the rest of the country is voting like Tennessee is voting, you're going to win by a lot
trump, And, we won, and we won by a lot
trump, We won by a lot
trump, Our nation is stronger today than ever before
trump, The number one economy on earth
trump, No economy is so strong
trump, We're rebuilding the awesome might of the United States military, and soon it will be stronger relatively speaking than at any time in our history, and when we took over, it was depleted
trump, We took over a depleted military
trump, It's not depleted anymore, I can tell you that
trump, Our spirit is strong
trump, Our stride is back and our stand is clear
trump, We are finally putting America first
trump, It's about time
trump, We've created six million new jobs since election day
trump, Nobody would've thought that was possible
trump, More than seven million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps, and they're happy
trump, They're happy
trump, 123,000 more Ohio workers are employed today than when I was elected
trump, Think of that number
trump, And, right now, Ohio is the most successful it's ever been in the history of our country
trump, Thank you
trump, Congratulations, Ohio
trump, Stand up, Mike
trump, And, you have a good governor
trump, I want to tell you that
trump, Good job
trump, Mike
trump, Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in over half a century and unemployment for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and Asian-Americans have all reached the lowest rates ever recorded
trump, While Republicans are working every day to build up our country, the rage-filled Democrat Party is trying to tear America apart
trump, The Democrat Party is now being led by four left wing extremists who reject everything that we hold dear
trump, No one has paid a higher price for the far left's destructive agenda than Americans living in our nation's inner cities
trump, They have paid a dear price
trump, Do you see what's happening You see our inner cities, we spend billions and billions and billions for years and years and years, and it's stolen money and it's wasted money and it's a shame
trump, For decades, these communities have been run exclusively by democratic politicians, and it's been total one party control of the inner cities
trump, For a hundred years, it's been one party control and look at them
trump, We can name one after another, but I won't do that because I don't want to be controversial
trump, We want no controversy
trump, No controversy
trump, The democrat record is one of neglect and corruption and decay
trump, Total decay
trump, The Democrats have tax and regulated jobs and opportunity out of these cities and out of existence
trump, They've squeezed the blood out of them
trump, Left wing mayors and city councils have opposed school choice, trapping children and failing in government schools left and right
trump, So many of these mayors right now, you know where they are They're in jail, that's where they are
trump, Republicans believe that every parent has the right to send their children to the school of their choice, but the greatest betrayal committed by the Democrats is their support for open borders
trump, These open borders would overwhelm schools and hospitals, drain public services, and flood communities with poisonous drugs
trump, It's tough enough, and I want to thank, by the way, the country of Mexico
trump, They've got 21,000 soldiers on the border right now
trump, I'm starting to like Mexico a lot
trump, They do a lot more for us than the Democrats do, right A lot more, a lot more
trump, And, the numbers are way down
trump, You'll see that
trump, Way, way down
trump, Democrat lawmakers care more about illegal aliens than they care about their own constituents
trump, They put foreign citizens before American citizens
trump, We're not going to do that
trump, 572 people were murdered in Chicago last year
trump, So, you got a lot of hot people outside, but we broke the all time record
trump, The homicide rate in Baltimore is significantly higher than El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala
trump, I believe it's higher than … Give me a place that you think is pretty bad
trump, Give me a place
trump, The guy says Afghanistan
trump, I believe it's higher than Afghanistan in our country
trump, Think of that
trump, I believe, we'll check the numbers and if we're wrong, they will tell us tomorrow
trump, It'll be headlines
trump, Trump exaggerated
trump, I do believe the rate is higher than Afghanistan, yet Democrats, and they've run it for many years, want to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on illegal migrants instead of supporting their own struggling communities
trump, No good, no good
trump, The conditions in Nancy Pelosi's once great city of San Francisco are deplorable
trump, They're deplorable
trump, Do you remember the word deplorable Do you remember when Hillary used the deplorable She used two words
trump, She used deplorable and irredeemable, right And only being a politician for a few years
trump, I said what a terrible mistake that she used the word irredeemable, but it turned out to be deplorable
trump, Deplorable was not a good day for Hillary
trump, Crooked Hillary
trump, She is a crooked one She's crooked
trump, She is crooked
trump, Nearly half of all the homeless people living in the streets in America happen to live in the state of California
trump, What they are doing to our beautiful California is a disgrace to our country
trump, It's a shame the world is looking at it
trump, Look at Los Angeles, with the tents and the horrible, horrible, disgusting conditions
trump, Look at San Francisco
trump, Look at some of your other cities, and then you have a governor … You have a governor that invites the whole world to come into California
trump, We'll pay for your healthcare
trump, Then you wonder why so many people are coming up
trump, They're coming up because we're the hottest economic country in the world, but they're also coming up because you have people like that governor say, Come on up
trump, We'll give you healthcare
trump, Come
trump, Who wouldn't come up Who wouldn't come up How crazy is this How crazy is this Schools, healthcare
trump, Today, I've a simple proposal for Democrat leaders to support legislation to end illegal migration, and we will use the vast savings to rebuild our inner cities
trump, That's the way we should be doing it
trump, That's what we should be doing
trump, By the way, you know, they keep talking about,  Oh, the voters, the voters, the voters
trump, They want all sorts of security
trump, What about a thing called voter ID Voter identification Rob Portman, please work on that, Rob Portman
trump, You have a great senator
trump, Would you please start working on that You see the response
trump, Every place I go, Rob
trump, Please, Rob
trump, Voter ID
trump, They give you everything they can give you except voter ID and the things that matter
trump, Republicans believe that a nation must care for its own citizens first
trump, Our pledge to America's workers has secured commitments to train more than 12 millions Americans for the jobs of tomorrow
trump, You know who's working very hard on that You probably never heard of her
trump, Ivanka Trump
trump, She's working very hard
trump, She gave up a lot
trump, She had a very easy life, but she loves doing it
trump, She's got over, I think, now 12 million people
trump, They're teaching them the great companies of our country, they're teaching people how to do it, and it's an incredible thing to watch
trump, To give former prisoners a second chance at life, we passed groundbreaking criminal justice reform that nobody could've passed except us
trump, President Obama tried, a lot of them tried, they couldn't get it passed
trump, I got it passed with a lot of help from liberals and conservatives, and a lot of help
trump, And, the biggest beneficiary is the African-American community
trump, Biggest beneficiary
trump, And, something which a lot of people don't talk about, but we doubled the child tax credit
trump, Doubled it
trump, Our tax plan also created nearly 9,000 opportunity zones, hottest thing going, providing massive new incentives for investment in job creation in distressed communities
trump, Left together, I put out a six minute video detailing everything I found unacceptable about liberalism and the Democrat Party
trump, Take your time
trump, Take your time
trump, Walk away
trump, Doctor Doctor in the house, please Okay
trump, Thank you very much
trump, Thank you very much
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you, doctor
trump, Thank you
trump, Don't forget, it's a hundred degrees in here
trump, That person's been standing there for almost a day if you think about it
trump, A lot of you, so I appreciate it
trump, And you know what They'll come back
trump, They'll get a little something and they'll come right back because there's never been anything like this
trump, There's never been anything, right Never been
trump, Thank you
trump, Incredible
trump, We established more than 300 opportunity zones in Ohio alone, and these are really working out incredibly well
trump, Nationwide, nearly eight million African-Americans live in opportunity zones, but every democrat voted against them
trump, Every single democrat, because they vote as a block
trump, It's the only thing they do good
trump, They stick together
trump, Their policies, no good
trump, They're lousy politicians, but they stick together like glue
trump, It's the only thing they have
trump, That's the only thing they have going
trump, Democrats deliver poverty for their constituents and privilege for themselves
trump, Republicans deliver jobs, safety and opportunity for all Americans
trump, We're thrilled to be joined tonight by many terrific Republican leaders, and we'll start off with a man who had a very, very tough race for governor
trump, A lot of people choke
trump, They choke like dogs
trump, They can't breathe, aw
trump, They can't breathe
trump, This guy was running against a so-called star … So, that's two protestors, and tomorrow night the headline will be, Protesters, Protesters
trump, You know what happened to the second one He looked at the guy in front of him and he said, Ah, I'm out of here
trump, Bye
trump, That's the way it works, that's the way it works, I guess
trump, Too bad
trump, But, a man who really has done a fantastic job, he campaigned so hard, and this was a star right from the fields of the great Pocahontas whose now lying and cheating her way to the presidency, if possible
trump, She's trying to win, remember She defrauded people with her credentials
trump, She said she was Indian, and I said that I have more Indian blood than she does, and I have none
trump, I'm sorry
trump, We drove her crazy
trump, And, we drove her crazy
trump, That's a good thing, not a bad thing
trump, She went out and she had a blood test done, and it came out 1,024th
trump, He said,  Somewhere back there, hundreds of years ago, there may have been an Indian
trump, Or it may have been a statistical error because it was so small
trump, Which, it was
trump, Anyway, but the guy was from her group
trump, You wouldn't be very happy right now, and we have a man that campaigned so hard, relentless
trump, I came in, we did a rally where we had people like this
trump, It was packed the day before the election and Mike DeWine won that election
trump, -and Mike Dewine won that election and he won it easily
trump, Mike Dewine
trump, We have a man who's running for governor of Kentucky again
trump, And he's done an incredible job
trump, And did you ever hear, sometimes you could do such a good job that not everybody appreciates it But they had a lot of problems with pensions and a lot of tremendous problems that a normal governor would never have been able to correct
trump, But when you correct it, you make yourself a little bit less popular
trump, But he had no choice and they had no choice
trump, It's a great, great state and he has turned out to be a great, great governor
trump, Matt Bevin
trump, He's running in November, and because I like him so much, Matt get a nice big arena ready, we're going to do a rally for you
trump, And a man who's fantastic son is here tonight who I just met, incredible
trump, When I ran with him, he was down
trump, I said, Rob Portman's down, and then about four weeks later he was up by like 24 points
trump, I said, What the Hell did you do And you know what he did He does a great job
trump, That's what he did
trump, Senator Rob Portman
trump, Great guy
trump, And we have a few guys that, these are warriors
trump, A couple of them you saw the other day, they were questioning Bob Mueller
trump, That was a beauty
trump, He was sharp, wasn't heHe was sharp as a tack and Steve Chabot and Brad Wenstrup, and Warren Davidson and Andy Barr and a man named Greg Pence who happens to be a brother of somebody I know very well
trump, They have been with us through thick and thin, and it has been mostly really good times because what we've done, no other administration in the first two and a half years in history has done
trump, Thank you fellas
trump, Great job
trump, A couple of them gave a grilling
trump, They gave a grilling
trump, All they had to do is mention the facts and it was over
trump, And also the auditor of the great state of Ohio, a man whose job I made much easier because you have money pouring in
trump, You have companies pouring in
trump, Keith Faber
trump, How is it Keith The numbers are good, Keith
trump, Numbers are good, right Yeah
trump, The numbers are good
trump, Ohio Senate President, Larry Obhof
trump, Larry, thank you
trump, Great job
trump, Nice tie
trump, I like Larry's tie
trump, And you have a couple of people that are very, very powerful
trump, I hear that office and I shudder, Ohio Supreme Court justices, Sharon Kennedy and Judy French
trump, Thank you
trump, Please don't recuse yourself because I gave you a nice welcome, should I ever be before you
trump, I love judges
trump, When they see you for about two seconds and then you say, oh, that judge should be fair
trump, And then they say, I'd like to recuse myself because 29 years ago I met Donald Trump
trump, I'd never have been in… We've been doing very well in the courts, by the way
trump, Have you seen We've been winning a lot of cases, a lot of cases
trump, We really have
trump,  179
trump, Percentage wise, it's the second most
trump, We will never be number one
trump, Sadly we'll never be number one
trump, So percentage wise, nobody's ever seen anything like it
trump, And that's because President Obama basically was not able for about three years to get his people in, which is a shame
trump, And I came in, I had 148 openings
trump, You're supposed to have none
trump, I said, How many do we have 148
trump, And I said, You got to be kidding
trump, And we've all done a good job together
trump, It's been amazing, with Mitch and you and everybody
trump, It's been amazing
trump, So we're going to be up to, within two months, 179 federal judges
trump, That's in two and a half years
trump, And what else Two great Supreme Court judges
trump, Great ones
trump, There's only one person
trump, I think most of you must know this
trump, Who percentage wise has done better than me with judges Tell me
trump, I'll give you a hint He appointed 100 of the federal judges and 100 of the United States Supreme Court
trump, George Washington
trump, That's one record we're not going to beat
trump, But I appointed many more than him, so let's take it that way
trump, Many anymore
trump, I also want to introduce a friend of mine who's done an incredible job
trump, She's really something, she has been incredible as a leader of the GOP
trump, She's the chair and she's my friend Jane Timken
trump, And aman Bob Paduchik
trump, You know Bob Paduchik So Bob, I had to pick campaign manager in Ohio and I kept hearing from the media, You must win the state of Ohio
trump, I heard this over and over for like a year and a half
trump, You must win Ohio
trump, You must win
trump, So I had to pick a campaign manager and I picked a man named Bob Paduchik
trump, And no matter what happened, no matter how badly we were doing, he said, Sir, you're going to win Ohio easily
trump, I said, But Bob, we just lost the head of the GOP in Ohio
trump, He left because you have a certain governor that asked him to leave
trump, Great support from the governor, a different governor than Mike by the way, slightly
trump, So he had to get out
trump, So I said, We just lost
trump, And Bob said, Don't worry about it, sir
trump, You're going to win
trump, In fact, I think you just went up
trump, Then we lost a couple of other people
trump, I'd call him
trump, I say, Bob, I'm worried about Ohio
trump, Very worried
trump, He said, Don't worry about it, sir
trump, I think he just went up
trump, He kept saying, You just went up
trump, I said to somebody, I don't know much about this guy, but boy, he's the most optimistic person I've ever met
trump, True
trump, He said, Don't worry
trump, We ended up winning Ohio by close to nine points, which is unheard of
trump, He was right
trump, Bob Paduchik
trump, Bob
trump, And also here tonight, I don't know, did he do a good job My son, Donald Jr
trump, and Kimberly
trump, I hope he did a good job
trump, Good, I heard you did
trump, I heard you did a great job
trump, He's been a great help
trump, They both have
trump, Thank you very much
trump, Thank you, Kimberly
trump, Thank you very much
trump, Our shared Republican agenda is pro worker pro jobs, pro family pro growth and 100 pro American
trump, We've eliminated a record number of job killing regulations, giving the average American household 3,000 more to spend every single year
trump, The previous administration tried to shut down American energy and close up, totally, close it up
trump, American clean, beautiful coal
trump, That's what they did
trump, That didn't work out too well, but you had a suffer
trump, It didn't work out well, but get a suffer for a long time until I came along
trump, You're not suffering any longer
trump, The previous administration, they liked to windmills
trump, If a windmill is within two miles of your house, your house is practically worthless
trump, They make noise, they're intermittent
trump, They kill your birds
trump, They break down all the time
trump, You have to replace them every 10 years because they wear out, and they cost a fortune and they need subsidy
trump, Other than that, they're quite good
trump, You don't want one of those windmills within vision
trump, You hear them, they're noisy
trump, They've got a lot of problems
trump, No, we're going to say with the great energy that's powering our businesses, that's creating so many jobs
trump, And solar, you know what We'll live with solar, but solar is peanuts by comparison to what you need
trump, But we're going to stay the way we have it
trump, We've ended the war on American energy and we're putting our coal miners back to work and our steelworkers back to work, and our auto companies back to work
trump, We've learned over the last three years the incredible gold that were sitting on top of in this country
trump, We're very lucky
trump, We're now the largest energy producer in the entire world, bigger than Soviet Union, formerly
trump, Remember the Soviet Union when it was all together
trump, The Soviet Union, when it was all together before they decided we got to call ourselves Russia
trump, When it was all together, they wanted to be, that was always their dream to be the biggest in the world
trump, Then it became Russia and you know what They've done a good job with energy and so has Saudi Arabia done a good job with energy
trump, But we're now bigger than Russia
trump, We are now bigger than Saudi Arabia by far
trump, I withdraw our country from the job killing and very expensive Paris Climate Accord
trump, Last year coal export were up 92 compared to 2016
trump, 92, do you believe that You're shipping it all over the world
trump, To Vietnam
trump, I was in Vietnam and they said, We get coal from Ohio
trump, We get coal from West Virginia
trump, It's the finest coal in the world
trump, We've created more than 110,000 new mining jobs, and thanks to states like Ohio the United States is now the number one producer of oil, the number one producer of natural gas, the number one everything having to do with energy
trump, Number one
trump, Anywhere in the world
trump, We're reversing decades of calamitous trade policies that led other countries to pillage our jobs, plunder our factories, and devastate Ohio communities and communities in every state
trump, The era of economic surrender is over, and when you look at what they've done to your jobs over a period of time, NAFTA was one of the worst deals ever made and probably the worst deal
trump, You still have empty buildings, empty factories, but now they're getting filled up pretty fast or being knocked down for brand new ones
trump, We have hundreds of new companies pouring into the United States
trump, My first week in office, I withdrew the United States from one of the last administration's worst sellouts
trump, It would have destroyed our automobile industry
trump, It would have destroyed manufacturing in this country, and maybe that's what President Obama meant when he said, you can't produce manufacturing jobs anymore in the United States, because he would've signed Trans Pacific Partnership and he would've been right
trump, I killed it
trump, And by the way, TPP, Trans Pacific Partnership would have destroyed the automobile industry in this country already
trump, Already the shipped down 30 of your jobs to Mexico
trump, Under the new USMCA
trump, That's Mexico and Canada
trump, We've got to get them to vote on that because that's an incredible deal
trump, But under the new… It's going to be very hard for companies to leave you, to fire you, to go down to make their product, whatever it may be, to send it back into the United States with no tax
trump, All we end up with this unemployment and taxes and empty buildings
trump, So they got to vote, on the USMCA
trump, Before I took office, foreign countries ripped us off, robbed us blind, and pushed us around, but America is not being pushed around anymore
trump, Do you realize that I got that from working in Ohio for two summers
trump, We've taken the toughest ever action to stand up to China's trade abuse, and I just announced another 10 tariff on 300 billion worth of Chinese products that come into our country
trump, And that's on top of the 25 that we take off 250 billion coming in from China, and don't let them tell you, the fact is China devalues their currency
trump, They pour money into their system, they pour it in, and because they do that, you're not paying for those tariffs
trump, China's paying for those tariffs
trump, For the last 20 years, China's taken hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars out of our country, and now we're stopping the theft of American jobs
trump, We're stopping the theft of so many other things happening, including intellectual property
trump, They steal our intellectual property
trump, I think they want to try and make a deal with us, but I'm not sure, because the word is, I feel they want to wait until they get… They're praying
trump, They're praying
trump, They would like to see a new president in a year and a half so they could continue to rip off the United States like they've been doing for the last 25 years
trump, Would love to see a guy like sleepy Joe Biden who has no clue what the hell he's doing
trump, They say to sleepy Joe
trump, Sir, Just sign right there
trump, Oh, okay
trump, I'll sign
trump, We'll be losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year to China
trump, It has to stop but they understand that
trump, President Xi is good man
trump, He's a friend of mine
trump, He understands it
trump, And until such time as there is a deal, we will be taxing the hell out of China
trump, That's all there
trump,  make your product in America
trump, Come on back to the United States
trump, Come on back to Ohio
trump, There's no tariff
trump, There's no tariff
trump, Thanks to steel tariffs, hundreds of thousands of tons, think of this, were dumped on our shores, and steel is like something else
trump, It's that quality
trump, They were dumping garbage, they call it sand steel, they call it dirt steel
trump,
trump, It was mixed up
trump, It was bad stuff and we didn't want to use that for our jet fighters and for our beams that hold up building
trump, But they were dumping tremendous quantities of steel, and what was happening is United States steel and all of our companies were going virtually out of business and I stopped it
trump, I put on a 25 tariff, billions of dollars is now pouring into our treasury and our steel companies and our steel workers are coming back
trump, Right here in Ohio
trump, Nucor a great steel company, and a steel company that's doing great again, Nucor, has announced an 85 million upgrade in Marion
trump, Charter Steel announced plans to build a new 150 million steel mill in Cuyahoga Heights, and Cleveland Cliffs announced a new 700 million plant in a very good place that I like a lot, Toledo
trump, Toledo, Ohio
trump, This was unthinkable because four years ago, steel plans were closing
trump, They weren't expanding or they weren't building
trump, We're building new plants in Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, all over
trump, Not Just Ohio
trump, On issue after issue, Democrats have forgotten who it is that they're supposed to represent
trump, They forgot
trump, I wonder why they forgot
trump, The job of elected officials is to represent American citizens, the radical Democrats even support deadly sanctuary cities which release dangerous criminals onto our streets
trump, Sanctuary cities
trump, Many of the places that have sanctuary cities and many of the people that live there, they don't want them
trump, They don't want them
trump, They're dangerous and not good
trump, Here are just a few examples
trump, In San Francisco, an illegal alien was arrested no fewer than 10 times in the span of less than one year for numerous counts of burglary and theft
trump, Yet each time San Francisco defied federal authorities and set him free and bad things happened when they set him free
trump, A sanctuary jurisdiction in California recently released a criminal alien from jail
trump, The very next month, the same individual was arrested for rape and then beyond anything you would even believe, a horrible thing happened
trump, But yet again, he was released back into your community
trump, After sanctuary city in New Jersey released an alien charged with domestic violence, he was arrested in Missouri for the murders of three people
trump, In the bizarre worldview of the third and hard left, they have no problem destroying the lives of innocent Americans for a single politically incorrect thought
trump, But they want to virtually, and you know this, they want virtual immunity for illegal aliens who have committed horrible crimes and murder
trump, Horrible crimes and murder
trump, Republicans believe our cities should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not criminal aliens
trump, And yes just won a big lawsuit last week
trump, In fact, on of my lawyers for winning that lawsuit is here tonight
trump, I gave him a little reprieve
trump, We need a lot of lawyers in the White House
trump, We get sued so much, so unfairly, but we're winning those lawsuits left and right, but one of them is here
trump, He said, I'd love to go to a rally
trump, I said,  I'm going to a place called Cincinnati, Ohio
trump, You deserve it
trump, We just won the lawsuit on the wall
trump, Where's Pat We just won the lawsuit on the wall
trump, You hear that We're building the wall faster and better than ever
trump, It's time for Democrats to end sanctuary cities and catch and release
trump, You know what you do You catch them and then you release them and you say, Would you please report back in four years from now
trump, But only 2 come back
trump, You know why Because they're not the smartest
trump, They are not the smartest
trump, They're the ones we don't want to have come back
trump, Only 2 show up
trump, Catch and release, we could end it immediately if the Democrats caved
trump, So what we're doing is something else
trump, We're keeping them out altogether
trump, We're replacing random migraines and we're replacing the lottery system
trump, How about the lottery system How about lotteries This was chuck Schumer
trump, You put the name in a basket
trump, The country puts the name in a basket and you picked people out of the lottery
trump, Well, let's see
trump, This one's a murderer
trump, This one robbed four banks
trump, This one, I better not say
trump, This one, another murder
trump, Ladies and gentlemen, another murderer
trump, Think of this
trump, Do you think they're going to put great citizens… they have great citizens, they have great people like we have great people
trump, Do you think those people are going into a lottery No
trump, And then we get these people coming in and we hold it against the country
trump, The country isn't based on that, the country, you just take a look, look at the people they put into these lotteries
trump, It's a disgrace
trump, And how we've done this for so many years folks, how we've done this
trump, It's an immigration system that's totally broken and we're going to win the House, we're going to win the Senate, we're going to win the presidency and we're going to do a merit based immigration system
trump, Merit based
trump, Merit based immigration
trump, And we need that because we have companies coming in from all over the world and we need good workers
trump, We need good people
trump, We're down to 3
trump,5 unemployment
trump, We need people, but we want people to come in based on merit, not based on some lottery put in by a governor
trump, Democrats have never been farther outside the mainstream
trump, Liberal politicians want to eliminate private- Dream
trump, Liberal politicians want to eliminate private healthcare and force everyone onto the government plan
trump, Remember the lies from the previous administration
trump, If you like your plan, you can keep your plan
trump, If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor
trump, 28 time, one lie after another
trump, 28 times it was said and it turned out to be a total lie
trump, My administration is defending your right to choose the plan and doctor that is best for you
trump, We're offering right now plans up to 60 cheaper than Obamacare and we will always protect patients with pre existing conditions
trump, Always
trump, Always
trump, Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion
trump, And then you'll have like a governor of Virginia, it's not only late term abortion, it's killing the baby after the baby is born
trump, How about that Think of that
trump, Think of that
trump, That's why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God
trump, Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, and they're the party, frankly, of socialism
trump, The Republican Party is the party of freedom
trump, We're the party of the American worker, the American family
trump, We're the party of the American dream
trump, I'm fighting for you each and every day
trump, I had a great life
trump, I used to get great publicity
trump, Nobody got better… I had such a great life
trump, It was so easy
trump, My great wife, the first lady, Melania, she said, You know, you've always been a hard worker
trump, You love to work, but your life was a lot easier in the old days
trump, But I love it and you know why I love it Because we're accomplishing so much
trump, Nobody ever thought it would be possible to do the things we're doing
trump, Even a thing like Right to Try, right Right to Try
trump, They've been trying to get that for years and years and years
trump, That's people that are really sick, terminally ill
trump, They couldn't get medicine
trump, We have the greatest doctors, the greatest clinics, the greatest technicians in the world
trump, They couldn't get anything
trump, They'd traveled to Asia if they had money
trump, They traveled to Europe
trump, They'd travel all over the world hoping for a cure
trump, If they had no money they'd just go home
trump, They'd die
trump, They had no hope
trump, For 44 years, they've been trying to get Right to Try
trump, We are so advanced in medicine
trump, We have a lot of things that probably work or possibly work, but we weren't allowed legally to give that to these people that were so sick
trump, You know why Because they didn't want this drug if it didn't work to hurt the people, but the people were terminally ill
trump, So I got it approved and it wasn't easy
trump, It was complicated
trump, The insurance companies didn't want to do it
trump, The government didn't want to do it
trump, The doctors didn't want to do it
trump, Tremendous liability
trump, But our country didn't want to do it
trump, They said, Well, if it doesn't work, we're going to get sued
trump, I say, So they'll sign an agreement, very strong, one page, taking all liability away from the United States, from the drug companies, from the doctors, all liability
trump, They're terminally ill
trump, Let's try it
trump, And you know what It's been a miracle
trump, So many people have done so well
trump, It's great
trump, We got it done
trump, When I set about the agreement, they had these great lawyers and they said, Gee, that's a good idea
trump, They'd been working in this few years
trump, They said, That's a good idea
trump, I said, Yeah, it's a good idea
trump, How about getting you to me like in about two hours Right to Try
trump, It's a great thing
trump, But we have so many things like that
trump, I have lists that you wouldn't even believe
trump, I have lists that go on for pages of things we've done
trump, We've launched a historic initiative to reduce the price of prescription drugs, including a plan to allow companies to import lower cost drugs from other countries
trump, It's a very unfair system
trump, Our country pays the highest prices in the world
trump, Last year was the first time in 51 years that drug pricing for prescription drugs actually came down
trump, Now we're going to bring it down by a lot
trump, We're going to bring it down a lot
trump, And now… So other countries… Here's an example, Canada pays half the price for a lot of drugs that we do
trump, So we have a great governor in the state of Florida, Ron DeSantis, calls me up
trump, Doing a great job
trump, Ron DeSantis
trump, He was at three and he went to 70
trump, that's a pretty good increase, right Ron DeSantis, a great governor
trump, And he comes to me, he goes, You know, if you buy the drugs, if we buy the drugs, because this is so botched up, we have a middleman
trump, It's not a good situation
trump, He said, If I could go and buy the drugs from Canada, I could save 50
trump, I said, Do it
trump, Do it
trump, And if you can buy them from Europe, because their system… Like, remember I used to scream when I was winning states and not getting the delegates that I was entitled to and I'd say the system is rigged Well, the drug system is rigged
trump, It's rigged
trump, So if we can buy the same drug made by the same pharmaceutical company from Europe or from Canada or from other places at a big deep discount, we're doing it and we're giving them the right to do it
trump, Just happened today
trump, And we're doing one other thing that, believe it or not is even bigger, but you'll be seeing that over the next two weeks
trump, With the help of your great Senator, Rob Portman, we've taken bold action to confront the opioid epidemic and in Ohio, drug overdose deaths went down 22 last year, 22
trump, No, but think of that
trump, Opioid, big problem, big problem
trump, Deaths went down
trump, Opioid deaths, 22
trump, Nobody writes that
trump, Nobody talks about that
trump, They don't want to talk about that
trump, Good job, Rob
trump, Good job
trump, Good job, Mike
trump, We passed VA Choice and VA Accountability on behalf of our great veterans
trump, They been trying to pass VA Choice for four decades
trump, They couldn't get it done
trump, We got it done
trump, We got it done
trump, This is where a veteran would stand online for three, four, five, six days, for three weeks, for five weeks
trump, Sometimes they're okay
trump, By the time they see a doctor, they're terminally ill
trump, And I said, You know, I have a great idea
trump, Because I not been doing that this long
trump, You know, we've been working with this for… I've been thinking about it a lot
trump, This was during the campaign
trump, What a campaign that was, right Was that a campaign or what And I came back to my people
trump, I had experts and I said, I have a great idea
trump, These lines for the veterans are too long
trump, It takes them three, four weeks sometimes to see a doctor
trump, I have a great idea
trump, Let's let them go outside
trump, Go to a private doctor
trump, We'll pay the bill
trump, They'll be fixed up all perfect and they can do it immediately
trump, We'll pay the bill
trump, And I thought… I said, Man, am I smart I am the smartest guy to think of that
trump, So I went before this panel of experts that were with me working on things and I said, How do you like that idea And they said, Sir, we've known about it for about 40 years, but we've never been… I said, Really You've known about it that long But here's the thing
trump, We got it done
trump, Nobody else could get it done
trump, Nobody else
trump, And Accountability
trump, You couldn't fire anybody
trump, If they were treating our vets badly, you couldn't fire them for anything
trump, People could steal
trump, They could be sadistic to our vets
trump, By the way, they wouldn't have done that in primetime to our vets
trump, I can tell you that
trump, They can be whatever they want
trump, You couldn't fire them
trump, And it was because of unions and it was because of other things
trump, Civil Service
trump, Very tough
trump, You couldn't fire anybody for almost anything
trump, We had cases where people got… They got caught stealing a lot of money and you couldn't fire them
trump, We got VA Accountability
trump, Now we say, Jim, get the hell out of here
trump, You're fired
trump, We're rebuilding our military
trump, And after years of budget cuts and layoffs, the army tank plant in… Do you Lima You call it Lima, right See You know, most people call it Lima, but I know Lima
trump, But you know why Because I came here and they said, We're closing this plant
trump, I said, What kind of a plant is it Remember when I was here In Lima
trump, And I used to say, You mean Lima They said, No, sir
trump, It's Lima
trump, That's why… Because, but Leah, hey look, I'll be honest with you because they have it wrong with the teleprompter, okay And I would have been in big trouble
trump, But the good news is I don't use the teleprompter too much
trump, If I did, you would've been out of here a long time ago because it gets very boring when you do the teleprompter deal
trump, But in Lima, and I said, What kind of a plant And I said, Let's go see it
trump, During the campaign I went to see it and they make the incredible, the best army tank in the world and I couldn't believe the complexity, the genius
trump, I said, Wait a minute
trump, You close this, you'll never be able to open it again
trump, You can't open this
trump, This isn't like a normal situation that you can open four walls and a roof
trump, This is complicated
trump, This is genius and you'll never replace these men and women that work here
trump, I said… And I didn't know anything at the time other than I said, You're not closing it
trump, They took it off to list
trump, They kept it open and now we're making army tanks around the clock
trump, We're investing in the future of human space flight
trump, Americans won the race to the moon and we will now win the race to Mars
trump, It's going to be amazing
trump, And you know, one thing I have to say also, and we're also winning the race to great, great strategic defense and offense, not just Mars
trump, And Mike Pence is doing a great job on that
trump, Great job
trump, To protect America's security, I withdrew the United States from the horrible Iran nuclear deal, a horrible, stupid deal
trump, We gave Iran 150 billion
trump, We gave Iran  1
trump,8 billion in cash
trump, Plane loads of cash
trump, I wonder what they saw when those planes landed
trump, I wonder what happened to the cash Can you believe it One 1
trump,8 billion we gave them in cash
trump, And remember what I said, Iran is a much different country than two and a half years ago
trump, When I took over, Iran was all over
trump, They had 14 to 18 different sites of confliction
trump, They were all over
trump, And now they just want to… They want a negotiated deal so badly
trump, Iran
trump, Iran
trump, I recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem
trump, And just a few months ago, we recognized the Golan Heights
trump, You know that
trump, That's another one
trump, Big one for the security of Israel
trump, Also recognized the legitimate government of Venezuelan and we condemn any of the socialist brutality taking place
trump, Let's see what happens there
trump, Let's see what happens
trump, Tonight we renew our resolves that America will never be a socialist country
trump, Never, ever, ever will it be a socialist country
trump, No matter what label they use, a vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of our great, our beautiful, our wonderful American dream
trump, We're not going to let our country ever go down the route of socialism
trump, You must never forget that the 2020 election is about one thing
trump, It's about you
trump, I say it again
trump, I say it all the time
trump, Never happened before
trump, There's never been a movement like this
trump, They've had movements
trump, They never went… They won a state
trump, They did well in the state
trump, We won 32 states
trump, There's never been anything like it
trump, There's never been anything like it
trump, But this movement is about your family and your future, and it's about the life and the fate of your country
trump, We begin our… Hey, look, this is a good place
trump, Is this a great thing to do We begin our campaign and we're going to do great, Bob
trump, Right, Bob Bob, if we don't do great, you're fired, Bob
trump, You're fired
trump, But think of it, our Ohio campaign with the best record, the best results, the best agenda, and the only positive vision for our nation's future
trump, And again, remember this, Ohio is doing better today than it's ever, ever, ever done before
trump, It's the best it's ever done
trump, What's going to do… A guy like a sleepy Joe Biden is going to come in and say, But I could do better
trump, I could do better
trump, He wants to go back to sleep
trump, Together we will continue unleashing the power of American enterprise so every American can reach their fullest and highest potential, tremendous potential
trump, Our country has such tremendous potential
trump, You know, we've had… The last week, we've had the highest stock market in the history of our country
trump, That means 401ks
trump, That means job
trump, But there's tremendous potential to go up
trump, We have tremendous potential to go up
trump, With your help, we will elect a Republican Congress to create a safe, modern, fair, and lawful system of immigration
trump, We will enact trade deals that ensure more products are proudly stamped with those four beautiful words Made in the USA or Made in America
trump, Either one
trump, You can use either one
trump, Made in America, made in the US
trump, We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine and I see what they're doing
trump, I see it
trump, They show me the things we're doing in our country today
trump, There's never been anything like it
trump, We will be ending the AIDS epidemic shortly in America and curing childhood cancer very shortly
trump, We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms
trump, Just remember with the Democrats, there is no second amendment
trump, You can forget about keep and bear arms
trump, You can forget it
trump, Above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one America
trump, We will never ever stop fighting
trump, We support, protect and defend the constitution of the United States
trump, We stand with our incredible heroes of law enforcement
trump, We believe in the dignity of work and we believe in the sanctity of life
trump, And we believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way
trump, We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always be proud, patriotic Americans
trump, And we will always live by the words of our national motto, In God We trust
trump, Two days ago, I spoke at the 400th anniversary of the first representative legislature assembly at Jamestown, Virginia
trump, It was beautiful
trump, It was incredible
trump, I was… I must tell you, I was reminded of so many great things in our country
trump, We have been blessed with such a remarkable and priceless heritage
trump, We are the greatest republic on the face of the earth and we are going to keep it that way
trump, Every day of my presidency, we will never forget that we are Americans and the future belongs to us
trump, The future belongs to all of you
trump, The future belongs to the greatest movement in the history of our country
trump, And with your help and your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working
trump, We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning
trump, We are one people in one family saluting one great American flag
trump, We all share the same home
trump, We all share the same heart
trump, And we all share the same love of Almighty God
trump, Together, with the great and proud people of Ohio, we are making America wealthy again
trump, We are making America strong again
trump, We are making America safe again
trump, We are making America great again and with your vote in 2020 we will keep America great
trump, Thank you, Ohio

trump, Beautiful place, beneath the majestic peaks, that's true, of the Rocky Mountains with thousands of terrific, hardworking, great American patriots
trump, With your help this November, we are going to defeat the radical Democrats and we are going to win Colorado in a landslide
trump, And you're going to help us get Cory Gardner across that line because he's been with us 100
trump, there was no waiver
trump, He's been with us
trump, There was no waiver with Corey
trump, We appreciate it
trump, Thank you Corey
trump, Thank you
trump, This month we mark a very special anniversary
trump, 75 years ago this week our brave United States Marines landed on the shores of Iwo Jima and began one of the bloodiest battles of the second world war
trump, It was a rough one
trump, Tonight it's our great privilege to be joined by three of the heroes of the Battle of Iwo Jima, James Blaine, Donald Whipple and John Thurman
trump, Great, great patriots, very brave people
trump, Just passed away
trump, Sadly he passed away just a few days ago
trump, He was going to be here
trump, Passed away a few days ago, but he was great

trump, Great, great gentlemen
trump, So we were going to have four
trump, We have three and we want to thank you for being here
trump, Thank you all
trump, Thank you
trump, Because America is truly a land of heroes, on behalf of the grateful nation I would like to recognize the many veterans of the Vietnam War and the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars who are here this evening, and a lot of them
trump, Great people, great people
trump, This is a truly incredible time for America
trump, We have the best economy in our history, the most prosperity of any country
trump, We are doing better than any country in the world, that is not even close
trump, And we've rebuilt our military over the last three years
trump, Don't tell anybody, but we spent two and a half trillion dollars
trump, But when it comes to our military and our safety and our security, we don't worry about budgets, right We don't worry about budgets
trump, We had to rebuild it
trump, It was depleted
trump, It was in bad shape
trump, It was old, it was tired
trump, We have the best people in the world, but they had old equipment
trump, Now we have brand new jets
trump, We have brand new missiles and rockets
trump, We have everything all made in the USA
trump, In my State of the Union Address, I proudly declared that we are in the midst of the great American comeback
trump, That's what we're doing
trump, Our country is stronger today than ever before
trump, After three years of ridiculous witch hunts and scams and partisan Democrat crusades, the radical left's attempt to poison our democracy and overturn this last election have totally failed
trump, They have been a complete flop and we today have the highest poll numbers we've ever had today, just came out
trump, And I don't know if anybody watched last night's debate, it got very big ratings and you know what Mini Mike didn't do well last night
trump, I was going to send him a note saying it's not easy doing what I do, is it It's not easy, Mike
trump, Not easy for any of them
trump, Now, Mike didn't do too well
trump, He went way down
trump, It's all right
trump, Mini mike
trump, How about Klobuchar, did you see her She choked
trump, She choked
trump, She couldn't breathe
trump, Alfred E
trump, Neuman looked at her and said something slightly derogatory and she said, Are you accusing me of being dumb Who would make a statement like that Because that's really what he was doing, but he doesn't want to say that
trump, No, how about that Are you saying I'm dumb That was the end of her campaign in my book
trump, You don't say that
trump, Even if it's true, you don't say that
trump, They had a crazy person on today on one of the Fox shows
trump, I tell you, Fox doesn't treat us the way they used to
trump, But we have the great Sean Hannity, we do, and we have Laura and Tucker
trump, And we have in the morning Fox and Friends, Steve and Ainsley, and Brian's gotten much better, he's moving up
trump, And we have the great Lou Dobbs
trump, Lou Dobbs says he's the greatest president ever
trump, The great Lou Dobbs
trump, He says, Lou Dobbs a year and a half, two years ago he said, He's the greatest since Reagan
trump, Then he said about six months ago, He's better than Reagan
trump, And then he said a few nights ago, He's the greatest we've ever had
trump, I said, Does that include Lincoln and George Washington He said, That includes them all
trump, That's Lou Dobbs
trump, The great Lou Dobbs
trump, And you've got Hegseth and you've got Jesse Waters
trump, How about Jesse And Judge Jeanine and even Greg Gutfeld
trump, Greg hated us, right But now he says, Look, whether I like him or not, he gets it done
trump, It's all about getting it done
trump, We're getting it done
trump, Nobody's ever done what we've done
trump, No, but Fox says, and I don't know, it's different
trump, It was different
trump, In the old days, it was better for us
trump, It was better for us
trump, But it's okay, we'll win anyway
trump, No, but they had this woman on
trump, Neil Cavuto, doesn't treat us good
trump, Neil Cavuto, he's not too good
trump, She said, I don't like him
trump, Nobody likes him
trump, Right now… So you had, remember Lest in The Readies You remember who was Lest in The Readies He got fired, right You remember, right Remember He's gone and now Neil's taking his place
trump, Neil is actually a nice guy, but he doesn't like Trump too much
trump, And he put this woman on today and she said, Donald Trump didn't do well in the debates and he won, because she was referring to Mike Bloomberg, sometimes referred to as Mini Mike
trump, And I said, Wait a minute, I won every debate
trump, It's true
trump, And we sent them polls, poll after poll after poll
trump, Not only won them, but won by a lot
trump, I won every debate
trump, I'm just saying every poll, they do those polls right after, three, four, 500,000 people, Time Magazine
trump, I said, Nobody's allowed to do that
trump, You can't do that
trump, We're at enough of a disadvantage with the fake news
trump, They make up 90 of the story
trump, So where is Dan Scavino Where is Scavino Does anyone know who Dan Scavino is Dan, bring me those pages up here
trump, Bring those pages up
trump, See if you can get them
trump, Go get them
trump, It's such fake news
trump, It's so disgusting
trump, You know what They'd do better if they told the truth
trump, Do you agree They'd do better
trump, Oh, someday in 10, 14, 18, 22 years when I'm gone, when we leave office in 26 years or so, they're going to miss us
trump, I told the story that a month before I ran, 2016 I was thinking about it
trump, I said to my wife, who has become a great First Lady
trump, People love here
trump, They said it's one of the greatest fields ever assembled
trump, And I said, What the hell should I run for if they are so great But I remember holding up the New York Times and it was like a leaflet that you give a certain, a supermarket, right It's like, the thing was blowing in the wind
trump, It was dead and now it's successful again
trump, But when we leave, it's all of us
trump, We leave together
trump, We're unified
trump, This is the most unified the Republican party has ever been
trump, And when we leave, the New York Times… Thank you
trump, The great Dan Scavino, the most powerful man in politics
trump, Hey Dan
trump, So Zuckerberg left
trump, Who is number one in the world on Facebook And I'm saying this in front of the fake news because if I'm wrong, they're going to report me, right Who is number one in the world on Facebook He walked in, but that's us
trump, He walked in for… We had dinner recently just because I want them to pay taxes
trump, I want to find out what's going on
trump, But he walked in, he's smart, and he said, I just want to congratulate you
trump, Small dinner, a few people
trump, He said, You're number one in the world in Facebook
trump, I said, That's nice
trump, I said, Who's number two He said, Prime minister Modi of India
trump, I said, Wait a minute, wait a minute
trump, He's got 1
trump,5 billion people and we have 350 so he should be number one
trump, But we're never going to give up that position of number one in the world for our country, for Facebook, for Twitter, for anything, and they still haven't figured it out
trump, They have not figured it out
trump, But look at all that press
trump, Look at all that press
trump, Did this ever happen before And then you have Brad Pitt
trump, I was never a big fan of his
trump, He got upset
trump, A little wise guy statement
trump, A little wise guy
trump, He's a little wise guy
trump, Anyway, but we're doing what Over here, I just showed this real quick
trump, Right So this horrible journalist, she's a real, she's a Trump hater
trump, You know what she's worth Zero ratings
trump, Nobody watches her, but she said… she was trying to… Look, Bloomberg made a fool out of himself last night
trump, He choked
trump, He's another one who's going,  Oh I can't breathe
trump, I can't breathe
trump, Don't ask me the question, please
trump, I look at my wife, I said, Let's send him a little note
trump, It's not so easy up there to do what I did, right Not so easy
trump, But this woman who is a third rate, fourth rate, she's been with everybody
trump, Every year she's with a different group, but I won't use her name because it'll make her too famous
trump, It actually plays to their advantage
trump, But she's third rate and she's on the lowest rated show at Fox, Neil Cavuto
trump, That's why
trump, So she said, Donald Trump didn't get good ratings
trump, He didn't do well in the polls
trump, She said, He didn't do well on the debates
trump, She said that we were defeated in the debates
trump, Well I defeated crooked Hillary every time and by a lot
trump, Yeah, she's crooked as a 3 bill
trump, I was going, Whatever happened to the 33,000 emails Whatever happened 33,000, she deleted them and her acid washed them and she didn't get in trouble
trump, Can you imagine if a Republican did that They would want to bring back the death penalty, right Two standards
trump, But I think things are happening
trump, I said drain the swamp, I just never knew how deep it was
trump, We have more garbage in the swamp than you would ever believe
trump, And this is part of the swamp
trump, So what happens She said, Donald Trump didn't do well in the debates
trump, Now remember my answer, Rosie O'Donnell, right First question I've ever, and we took down the house
trump, Then the second, Brett Barry asked me, I had to raise the hand
trump, I'm the only one, I guess that raised the hand
trump, Right And the place went crazy because I was the only one telling the truth
trump, Okay Turns out I was the only one telling… And the people get it
trump, But she said I didn't do well on the bench
trump, I said, Really I won every single debate
trump, We had 15 to 14 debates, then we had the presidential debates with crooked Hillary against myself
trump, So here's one
trump, I don't want to… I'm a little guilty because these are all my friends, right A lot of them are my friends now
trump, They weren't my friends then, they were my mortal enemy
trump, It's hard to be friends when you're competing against somebody
trump, You're right about that
trump, So here's Donald Trump, 67

trump, Although actually I do like the new owner
trump, This year I got beaten out by Gretta
trump, You know Gretta Last year I got beaten out… I mean, I've won it
trump, But when the world evolves around all of us, we should be chosen
trump, There's nothing wrong with it, right I mean, we've won it, but we should win it every single year, let's face it
trump, And now they call it person of the year
trump, They don't go out man of the year
trump, And I know the women out there are saying, Isn't that nice But a lot of the women out there don't like it
trump, They don't like it
trump, We could have a woman of the year and a man of the year
trump, I like that

trump, They've actually been not so bad and Joe Kiernan is a good guy
trump, He is a good guy
trump, Some of the rest, I don't care for it too much
trump, Becky's like, she plays it a little bit down in the middle, right Which is okay
trump, Trump, almost 50
trump, Then they have all the rest of them
trump, 14, 4, 3, 2, 2
trump,8, 2
trump,54, 1
trump,9, I'm not going to give you the names
trump, I won't tell you that I got 48
trump,8 and Jeb Bush got 1
trump,1
trump, The rest I'm not going to talk about, but he hasn't been exactly a great supporter, sort of a never Trumper I guess
trump, So Jeb, 1

trump, This was against crooked Hillary
trump, So look at that
trump, Trump was 74
trump,6, crooked Hillary Clinton was 24
trump,1
trump, Trump was 80, crooked Hillary was 18
trump, And I've got this woman
trump, You know who it is, right Nobody knows the name
trump, I'm not going to mention it
trump, But everybody knows Neil Cavuto
trump, She has no credibility and neither do you, Neil Cavuto
trump, Here's another one
trump, Crooked Hillary, and by the way, one is a Fox poll, one is Breitbart, one is a Drudge report
trump, One is a Patch, one is Syracuse
trump,com, one is Pollack Opinion, Alyssa Goodwin
trump, But look at these numbers
trump, Trump 92
trump, What is it So I'm winning every poll, I beat crooked Hillary
trump, Here's the one, Trump 61, crooked Hillary 39
trump, Okay That's what it is
trump, And then I turn on the damn show on Fox
trump, Again, it's not the same
trump, It was much better
trump, It really was
trump, It was much better
trump, I turn on Fox and I've got this third rate political journalist, if you call her that saying, Trump did very poorly in the debates, but he became president
trump, No, I did great in the debates
trump, I became president because of the debates, because unlike Mini Mike, I could answer questions
trump, And here's the final one and I could get you another 15
trump, These are all the ones that taken right after
trump, People call in, hundreds of thousands of people, they call in Time Magazine, CNBC
trump, So here's a CNBC, crooked Hillary Clinton, 39
trump, Donald Trump, 61
trump, and then this stupid person said I didn't debate well
trump, Now look, I don't mind and you can have bad debates, but I won every single debate
trump, Listened to this, then three and a half, four years later I have to listen to a person saying how we didn't do well, because these people are among the most dishonest people anywhere in the world
trump, Take it
trump, Take it
trump, Here it is
trump, Okay, let's get back to business
trump, Now I feel good
trump, Now I feel good
trump, She's a third rate journalist
trump, Let's go
trump, We're standing up in defense of our constitution, our freedom and democracy itself, right While the extreme left has been wasting America's time and doing all sorts of vial hoaxes, we went through hoaxes
trump, We went through the impeachment scam
trump, And by the way, Corey was with us all the way
trump, He didn't move
trump, He didn't budge
trump, He said it's a lot of bull
trump, He said it's a lot of bull
trump, But while they're doing that stuff and we're working with a cloud, we're working with these people
trump, They want to take you out
trump, They want to change the results
trump, They got caught spying, let's say it like it is, right They got caught spying on our election
trump, Fake news
trump, Hey fake news, take your cameras for a change and show them the room and show them behind you
trump, Go ahead, show them the room
trump, Show them the room
trump, You see, they never do it, including Fox, by the way
trump, Fox is not that much better
trump, We just got lucky because we have some… All their high rated shows are the shows that like Trump, all their losers shows like Cavuto are the shows that don't like Trump
trump, How is Shep Smith doing lately, by the way How is Shep Smith He had the lowest ratings and now Cavuto took his place so that's okay
trump, But they never show the room
trump, My wife, a great First Lady, she goes… I say, Hi honey
trump, Did you watch the debate Yeah
trump, How did the room look Was that… because last night I think we turned away 21,000 people
trump, We had an arena that it held 12, but we fill up the basketball courts, right Or the ice rink
trump, We had to have 15, 16,000 people
trump, It was on fire
trump, You all saw it
trump, It was great
trump, And she said to me, she said, Darling, how did you do I said, I did great
trump, I said, Did you see the arena And she said, No, they never show the arena
trump, You know that guy Dana White at UFC I won't tell you about him yet, but he's a brilliant guy, right I mean, he sold his crazy fighters, I mean bomb bomb bomb
trump, 4 billion he got with Fertittas, great people
trump, But you know what They're always showing it's full
trump, It's full
trump, These fakers back there, they don't want people
trump, But I'll tell you what my wife said, They don't show it, but you can't imitate 15,000 people when it comes to the noise
trump, Look, they won't show it
trump, They never show it and we've never had an empty seat from the day I came down the escalator, not one
trump, What these guys do if Mr
trump, And Mrs
trump, Jones sitting right up there, beautiful couple
trump, If she said, Darling, I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do about it, darling
trump, I have to go to the bathroom
trump, He said, Darling, I'll walk with you
trump, The cameras glong on to those seats, they glong on and they say, There were two empty seats
trump, Trump didn't fill up the room
trump, These are the worst people
trump, But when I told them to spin around those cameras, they stayed that way
trump, Now, if we had a protestor somewhere in the arena, it could be up in that corner where it's loaded up with people, those cameras that can do, they look like a pretzel
trump, They look like a pretzel
trump, They want to find it
trump, There's trouble, those same guys could, it could cover anything
trump, I used to think, well it's the equipment, it's very rigid
trump, They can't turn it
trump, And then some idiot from up in the corner starts screaming stupid stuff, because that's dangerous in this room, to be honest
trump, We don't have it too much
trump, They only pick on the guys that are all by themselves and aren't fighters
trump, But if somebody up there does something, those cameras turn around, spin around like a pretzel
trump, They bend, boom, they get
trump, So that was the end of my theory that we have rigid equipment
trump, And by the way, I told them, turn around, not one of those cameras turned around to show the room because it's fake news
trump, While the extreme left has been wasting America's time with vial hoaxes, we've been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, enacting fair trade deals, securing our border and lifting up citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed, right We added another 225,000 brand new beautiful jobs last month, way, way, way above what our great geniuses back there thought it would be, 225,000
trump, Think of it, we right now have more people working in our country than at any time in the history of our country, almost 160 billion
trump, 00 in the morning, they are watching
trump, The whole world was watching
trump, That was the most exciting television that anybody's ever seen
trump, Even ESPN, some guy on ESPN said, This is the most exciting event I've ever seen
trump, And all he does is watch sporting events and big ones
trump, But since the election, 7 million brand new beautiful jobs have been added and we've invested more than 2 trillion into that military that we talked about
trump, And we created- Into that military that we talked about, and we created something that's very exciting
trump, And we have our great new General
trump, He's on the … he's on our … I'll tell you, he was on a list of the most incredible men you've ever seen
trump, The sixth branch of the United States Armed forces, the Space Force
trump, And I will be making a big decision for the Space Force as to where it's going to be located, and I know you want it
trump, We'll be making that decision toward the end of the year
trump, I was here, I did your … I met … I was up at the Air Force Academy, and I greeted those kids, they were so great
trump, I did the commencement address
trump, Was anybody there I did the commencement address
trump, And the General said, sir, would you like to shake hands with the cadets I said, does everyone else do it, President Oh, yes, sir
trump, What he didn't say is, they'll shake 10 hands
trump, I said, so they do … how many do you have Sir, we have 1156 cadets
trump, I said, you mean other people do it Yes, sir
trump, But they don't do 1156
trump, They'll do 30, 40
trump, They'll take the top 10 out of the class
trump, I said, I'll do it
trump, I stood there for two and a half hours and the sun was blazing
trump, True
trump, And I shook 1156 hands
trump, And a lot of these kids are very strong physically
trump, In fact, you have one of them as an example, he was the winner of the home run derby
trump, Did you know that College … think of that
trump, The college home run derby
trump, I said, let me see you
trump, I want to see what you look like
trump, He stands up, uniform, everything else
trump, And by the way, I did something for Air Force, but I did something for all of the academies
trump, If you were a great athlete and they had a hard time recruiting, although they've done well, if you're a great athlete, you can't … we wanted to get them to go, but they didn't because they didn't want to serve five years in the military and then they'd go into the NFL or baseball
trump, So, I had one of the teams in
trump, They said, sir, give us the waiver, sir
trump, They've been after the waiver
trump, You know what the waiver is That means that if you're a great athlete, you can go to the Air Force Academy, or Army, Navy, the Coast Guard, you can go to one of our service academies
trump, I did the rule and we got it through Congress
trump, And you don't have to serve
trump, You go directly into the major leagues and to the NFL, and you serve your time after, when you get out
trump, Isn't that great And the Army coach, who's a great guy … all great guys
trump, Navy coach, Army coach, said sir, if you do that, we can compete with anybody, because we lost lot of great athletes who said, you know, we just can't do that
trump, Now they serve their time afterwards
trump, Isn't that great And we did it
trump, They've been trying to get that for so many years
trump, But I love that group of people
trump, I saw this guy from the home run derby, and I shook hands
trump, Oh, I shook hands
trump, And they come up and they're strong people
trump, And they're shaking, and they're excited
trump, They're a little nervous, maybe
trump, They're meeting the President
trump, They're a little nervous, and they're strong
trump, They've got big, strong hands, and they're saying … and I'm saying, hello
trump, Sir, thank you
trump, Man
trump, Jeez
trump, What are you I'm captain of my wrestling team, sir
trump, I admire you greatly, sir, thank you, sir
trump, It's like … and I'm trying to act like it doesn't hurt
trump, By the end of the day, I'm going like … but we did it
trump, And then I said, wait a minute
trump, I said, General, no other President could do that
trump, The Presidents don't do that
trump, He said, no, they do, sir, but they stop, usually, at around 50
trump, Oh, that's great
trump, But I love the Air Force Academy
trump, And you have all of the infrastructure, so you're being very strongly considered for the Space Command
trump, Very strongly
trump, And actually, I have to say this
trump, I think I can say this, Mr
trump, Senator, but the Governor showed up at the plane today, your Governor
trump, Democrat
trump, No, but in all fairness, he showed up because he wanted to lobby to see if they could get it
trump, That's okay, that's all right
trump, And we are going to be making that decision, Cory, when we make that decision, all right Okay
trump, But we've destroyed the ISIS territorial caliphate 100 percent
trump, We killed the founded and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi
trump, He's dead
trump, He's dead
trump, And we just killed the world's number one terrorist, Qasen Soleimani, ending his evil reign of terror forever
trump, Forever and ever
trump, He was the king of the roadside bomb, right When you see these young men and in some cases women, no legs, no arms
trump, They get it, and 92 percent of them were from Soleimani, and then they started making them … they had great detection
trump, We had these guys, great detection, then all of a sudden, the detection wasn't working because they started making them out of plastic instead of metal
trump, So they're blowing the guys up with the scopes, so they had the scopes on and that happened recently because they started making it out of plastic
trump, Real scum, but he's gone, he's evil, he's dead, and America is respected again like never before
trump, But as we keep on winning, Washington Democrats keep on losing their minds
trump, They've gone nuts
trump, That's why millions of registered Democrats, voters, people that were with the Democrats for a long time, they're leaving their party to join our movement
trump, They're joining our great Republican party
trump, We have more enthusiasm than any party has had in the last 50 years
trump, And don't believe stories, and don't believe polls, because the polls are worse than the stories
trump, They give phony polls
trump, 00
trump, The polls have closed … and you know they only announce if you're very … if you're really going to win by a lot
trump, Otherwise, it takes all night
trump, The polls have closed in the great state of Texas
trump, Donald Trump has won the great state of Texas
trump, Thank you
trump, But they had Alfred E
trump, Newman, Buttigieg, little Buttigieg
trump, I said, I've had you up to here
trump, They had little Buttigieg leading Donald Trump in Texas
trump, These people
trump, But very close
trump, They said, it's too close to call, where Buttigieg … so, a friend of mine from Texas, a big, powerful, strong guy, real Texas, he's got the cowboy hat … I'd love to wear that hat, I wouldn't have to comb my hair so much
trump, I wouldn't need hairspray, right I love those Texas hats
trump, I don't know if we'd get away with it in Washington, that's my only problem, but I love them
trump, This guy wears that big hat, the biggest hat
trump, He's a big guy
trump, And he's interviewed by somebody
trump, He said, listen, I don't know much about politics, but I can tell you one thing
trump, Buttigieg is not tied with the President
trump, The President is leading him by 20 points
trump, It's like I said the last time, nobody's leading Trump in Texas
trump, And you know what Nobody is even close to us in the great state of Colorado
trump, We're leading big
trump, Nobody
trump, With your energy and enthusiasm, this November, and specifically it's November 3rd is the big day, and this is going to be as big … and I can't say bigger, because what was bigger than that They came from the hills, they came from the mountains, they came out of the rivers, they came all over the place
trump, Great people, they just never saw anybody they wanted to vote for
trump, Women would come in, they hadn't voted in 20 years, great women, beautiful women, strong women, smart women, wives
trump, No, no, incredible
trump, And they love our country and they work hard and they pay their taxes and they work and they're … we're the elite, just so you … they're not the elite, we're the elite
trump, And you know what They'd show up, they've got Trump bandanas along with our great Vice President Mike Pence, Trump Pence, and they got the hats now and they walk … these are people that were never political people
trump, They never wore a pin
trump, Now they've got 30 pins all over their chest, they've got the hats with the things and the Trump, and nobody's ever seen anything like it
trump, Really, it's a great revolution, and we're turning this country around
trump, And I'm not saying anything can ever compete with 2016, but I think if we don't do it, a lot of what we've done, and we're going to go over the jobs and the regulation cuts and what we've done for the vets with choice and accountability, but you know what They can undo it, but in four years they can't undo it, because that tree will be planted
trump, It will be solid
trump, They're not going to be able to do it, so we've got to win
trump, And your second amendment is at stake, remember that
trump, So this November, we're going to take back the House, we're going to hold the Senate, and we are going to keep the White House
trump, So we're thrilled tonight to be joined by many great leaders from across this incredible state and from all over the country, and I want to thank Mike Pence

trump, That's why he loves me
trump, They didn't want … they said, it's too dangerous
trump, Nobody would take it
trump, I'm the only who said, take it
trump, We'll take it

trump, Like you said, I've known this man for 20 years
trump, We've actually become even closer since he's become the President of the United States

trump, Please keep the birds away from those windmills, please
trump, Tell those beautiful bald eagles, oh, a bald eagle
trump, You know, if you shoot a bald eagle, they put you in jail for a long time, but the windmills knock them out like crazy
trump, It's true
trump, And I think they have a rule, after a certain number are killed you have to close down the windmill until the following year
trump, Do you believe this Do you believe this And they're all made in China and in Germany
trump, Siemans
trump, And for those of you that want to hear it, when they're making them, more stuff goes up into the air and up into the ozone, the atmosphere
trump, More stuff is going up there, they're making it, ay, ay, ay
trump, And they don't say this, but after a period of time they get tired, they get old, they get rusty, and a lot of the guys say, hey, their useful life is gone
trump, Let's get the hell out of here, and they're all over the place
trump, You look at Palm Springs, California
trump, Take a look
trump, Palm Springs, they're all over the place
trump, They're closed, they're rotting, they look like hell
trump, Every major Democrat running for President wants to entirely eliminate American production of oil and natural gas, crushing Colorado's economy, destroying tens of thousands of Colorado energy jobs and demolishing property values all across the state
trump, They're doing that
trump, Look, you're going to vote for one of these people, probably crazy Bernie
trump, He seems to be leading
trump, Mini Mike, I thought he might come up, but he can't because he can't debate
trump, He wasn't meant for the camera, do we agree He wasn't exactly great last night
trump, No, I think he lost too last night
trump, Only in Colorado could somebody say that
trump, No, you're going to probably … it looks like Bernie, doesn't it It looks like crazy Bernie
trump, Crazy Bernie's not big into natural gas and oil, and the things that keep our great factories and plants going
trump, But Colorado voters will never let it happen
trump, We're reversing decades of calamitous trade policies
trump, America lost one in four manufacturing jobs following the twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance into the WTO
trump, But under this administration, all of that is changing
trump, The era of economic surrender is over, thank you
trump, It's over
trump, Last month, we ended the NAFTA catastrophe and I signed the brand new U
trump,S-Mexico-Canada agreement into law
trump, Incredible deal
trump, The USMCA is a gigantic victory for farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers all across the great state of Colorado and every other state
trump, Also, something we got that people don't talk about, if you love your children, you don't have to pay estate taxes on your beautiful small farms and businesses
trump, If you love your children, it's great, and if you don't love your children, don't worry about it
trump, Who in the hell knows
trump, If you don't love them, don't leave that beautiful farm to your children
trump, Give it to somebody else, okay If they don't treat you well, give don't leave them a damn thing
trump, Are you listening, Donnie Are you listening, Donnie I also took … no, it is true
trump, That's a big deal
trump, Farmers were leaving their ranch and their farms and their … people were leaving their small businesses to their family and they were being assessed in valued much higher in many cases than it was worth
trump, You couldn't do it
trump, They'd go out … your kids would go out and borrow a lot of money
trump, They'd end up losing their business, losing your farm that was in your family for 150 years
trump, You know what happens
trump, And they're good kids, and maybe they'll never be you
trump, They can't farm like you and maybe they can't any maybe they can, maybe they're better
trump, But you know what They'd go out and they'd borrow a lot of money and they'd lose the farm
trump, The numbers are staggering
trump, We got rid of it
trump, No more death tax, no more inheritance tax
trump, And I also took the strongest ever action to confront China's massive theft of American jobs
trump, What they've done to us over the years, we were losing 200 billion, 300, 400, 500, not million, billion
trump, Billion
trump, Not million
trump, 500 million would be a lot
trump, We're talking about 500 billion, they were taking it
trump, Our strategy worked
trump, We put tariffs up, 25 percent on the first 250 billion
trump, Billions of dollars poured into the United States
trump, They devalued their currency and they pumped money in
trump, We didn't pay for it despite the fact that these guys … they like to say they did, we didn't pay for it, and I'll tell you what
trump, China- They like to say they did
trump, We didn't pay for it
trump, I'll tell you what, China came to the table, and we made a deal that's great for us and hopefully it's great for them
trump, Last month, as you know, we signed a groundbreaking trade agreement with China that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, and boost American exports 250 billion worth of purchases, 50 billion worth of farm agricultural purchase, 50 billion
trump, You know the most they ever purchased were 16 billion
trump, You know that story
trump, I've told it a couple of times
trump, 16 billion was the most ever
trump, Secretary Sonny Purdue agriculture, he's done a great job
trump, I said, Who's the most What's the biggest year 16 billion, sir
trump, I said, All right, make it 20
trump, So they agreed on 20 so now we're getting ready to close the deal, biggest trade deal ever made, biggest deal ever made
trump, We're getting ready to close the deal between that and USMCA
trump, We're getting ready to close it
trump, I go over, I say, What do you have down for the farmers They've been great, although I have been helping you out
trump, I gave you a lot of money
trump, I gave you a lot of money
trump, 16 billion on year, 12 billion from the year before
trump, I took it out of the tariffs or we had a lot leftover, but think of it
trump, But I said, So tell me fellas, let me ask you, what do we have What's the number  20 billion, sir
trump, They're going to purchase 20 billion worth of farm products
trump, I said, Make it 50
trump, Tell them to make it 50
trump, So, we went to China and they were great
trump, You know they got 1
trump,5 billion people
trump, You got a lot of feeding to do
trump, I said, Do me a favor, instead of 20 billion purchased from our farmers, would you make it 50 No, no, no, no, no, and they agreed to do it
trump, They agreed to it
trump, I don't think you're going to be able to make it
trump, You better be able to make it
trump, I don't want the farmers coming to me, sir, sir, I'm sorry we can't produce that much, sir
trump, I said, Our farmers will find a way
trump, They'll go out and buy larger tractors and they'll buy some extra land
trump, Go out and buy a bigger tractor or something
trump, No, but it is true
trump, I've had people say, Sir, they can't produce that much
trump, I said, Forget it
trump, They will
trump, Look at them
trump, You're a farmer
trump, They'll figure that one out
trump, Although Mike Bloomberg said you'll never figure it out
trump, They'll figure it out long before him
trump, You'll figure that one out long before him
trump, No, I know the farmers
trump, I'm not worried about it
trump, 50 billion on no issue have Washington Democrats more thoroughly sold out the American people than on immigration
trump, Every day Democrats open border policies are harming and killing innocent lives
trump, This region alone, last year ICE officers arrested over 2000, and by the way, our ICE officers, these guys are tough and they're brave
trump, Over 2000 criminal aliens, that's MS-13 gangs, thousands, and they bring them back to where they came from
trump, By the way, now their countries take them back
trump, They weren't taking them back, safe third agreements
trump, They take them back
trump, Charged or convicted of dangerous offenses including robbery, rape, and murder
trump, We bring them back and in some cases we don't even want to bring them back
trump, We have to put them
trump, I don't want to house them for the next 50 years, but you know what We don't want to take chances either, but we'll bring them back to Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico
trump, We bring them back
trump, They didn't use to take them
trump, They said, We don't want them back
trump, Oh, okay, we'll keep them ourselves
trump, We don't do that anymore
trump, In Denver, an illegal alien was recently charged with brutally stabbing a judge multiple times, attempting to murder him his own home
trump, The alien had been arrested 36 times over the past 20 years
trump, Other than that, he was a very fine fellow, for crimes including assault and child abuse, yet somehow they kept letting him go and he was still in our country
trump, In communities across the nation, radical, and we're watching them very closely, left wing politicians are imposing deadly sanctuary cities, and sanctuary states, and policies that compel local law enforcement to release these illegal aliens straight into your beautiful communities
trump, Last year, Colorado Democrats enacted a law declaring this entire state to be a sanctuary for dangerous criminals
trump, As a result of state and local sanctuary policies, officials in Boulder defied federal law enforcement and released a previously deported child molester into the community
trump, In Denver, officials released a criminal alien arrested on felony drug charges, and now he is a very dangerous man
trump, We just caught him for attempted murder
trump, Right here in Colorado Springs, El Paso County officials defied the requests of federal law enforcement and released a criminal alien arrested for robbery, assault, and kidnapping
trump, They released him straight into your community
trump, These are the Democrats
trump, These are your Democrats
trump, Democrats think that Colorado should be a haven for murderers, predators, kidnappers, and felons in our country and that come in illegally
trump, Republicans believe that Colorado should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not criminal aliens
trump, If you want to shut down sanctuary cities and stop sanctuary states, if you want to protect your family and your loved ones, you must vote for Cory, vote for Trump, vote for the Republican party
trump, We're getting it done
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you very much
trump, Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, we've reduced illegal border crossings for eight straight months in a row
trump, Illegal crossings are down 75 since last spring, and we have ended the horrible practice of catch and release
trump, You know what you do You catch him
trump, You say, Where do you live They don't live here
trump, They don't have an address
trump, Where do you live Give us your address
trump, They don't have an address
trump, Many are criminals
trump, Many are very dangerous criminals
trump, So they're saying, and we are building the wall
trump, It's gone up 122 miles as of yesterday
trump, It's a serious wall
trump, Did you hear Two weeks ago, a small section, twice the size of this stage, we were putting it up and they're pouring the concrete, and a lot of, it's Mexico, it's very rough territory, some of it
trump, It's partially desert
trump, We were in a rough area, very windy, and we had a tremendous sand and wind storm
trump, So we hadn't put it in
trump, We put it in and it was just getting set, and we got hit with a tornado of wind and it blew it down, and the fake news said Trump's wall fell down
trump, It was blown down
trump, But see, at least we have a voice where we can explain
trump, It's true
trump, We lifted it up and we held it up
trump, When the storm went by, we had it set and it's set beautifully, and the following day, that sucker is going to be up for many, many years
trump, Can you imagine I said what happened in a certain area, and we're doing a great job by the way, in New Mexico
trump, New Mexico is going to be a great, great state for the Republican party, and Arizona, what we're doing on the border in Arizona, they want us to do it badly
trump, But can you imagine that A thing falls over because the concrete was just poured, it's soaking wet and it falls over, and they make it sound like the wall fell down
trump, These are very, very dishonest people, but you know that
trump, Border patrol has seized the largest amount of deadly narcotics over the last year ever recorded
trump, It's horrible what's happening, the largest amount ever recorded
trump, We've deported record numbers of gang members, especially the MS-13 gang members, but there are others that are just as bad
trump, We've done more to secure the border than any administration in the history of our country
trump, The border is going to be very soon secured
trump, We'll have, some time next year, over 500 miles of beautiful, powerful wall built
trump, Washington Democrats have never been more extreme taking cues from crazy Bernie Sanders, 132 congressional Democrats have signed up for Bernie's healthcare takeover that would strip 180 million Americans of their great private coverage that you want
trump, While the Socialist Democrats are trying to destroy American healthcare, and trying to destroy your social security, that won't happen with me, my administration is protecting your social security, your Medicare, and is fighting to give you great, great healthcare, already done a good job
trump, We're defending your right to keep the doctor, and to keep the plan of your choice
trump, Remember, President Obama 28 times, he said, Keep your doctor
trump, Keep your plan
trump, Keep your doctor
trump, Keep your plan
trump, Keep your doctor
trump, Keep your plan
trump, Right It was a lie
trump, We should impeach him
trump, We should impeach him
trump, Impeach Obama
trump, Get him out of office
trump, No, nobody thought of that
trump, We caught him in a lie 28 times at least
trump, He's on record
trump, We caught him in a lie, but nobody said let's impeach him
trump, Only these maniacs, crazy Nancy Pelosi, crying Chuck Schumer
trump, What about the little pencil neck, right Pencil neck
trump, He's got the world's smallest neck
trump, Here's a guy that lied about my statement
trump, He made up a statement and he delivered it before a contract
trump, He made up a statement
trump, It was totally fiction
trump, He made it up and then they tell me, you're getting ready to sue him, and they say, Oh no, he's protected because he made the statement in the halls of Congress
trump, That should be worse
trump, No, that should worse
trump, Little wise guy
trump, We're making healthcare better and much cheaper while premiums more than doubled in the five years before I took office
trump, We're now offering plans that are up to 60 less expensive and they're better
trump, They're better
trump, We're protecting people with pre-existing conditions and we always will
trump, We're fighting to stop surprise medical billing
trump, I signed an executive order imposing price transparency
trump, That's going to be bigger than healthcare in a certain way
trump, Watch the prices come down because when providers are required to show their prices, those same prices fall very, very fast
trump, We have approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs, which are just as good as the name brand drugs, but at a tiny fraction of the cost
trump, We have totally transform veteran's health care, including getting the long sought VA choice and VA accountability
trump, So, now if our veterans have to wait in line, they go out to a doctor, a local doctor, we pay the bill and they're all set
trump, They don't have to wait for six weeks
trump, He's agreeing, right Good
trump, Right You don't see those stories
trump, You used to see all these horrible vet stores, veterans, the veterans on television, and you don't see it because veterans choice, it's amazing
trump, Our great veterans, here's a man right here
trump, You're saying, yes
trump, Purple Heart
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you
trump, That's great
trump, But it's a lot different under Trump, isn't it A lot different under Trump, and now you go out to a private doctor, but you know, we also got accountability
trump, They've been trying to get these things done for 45, 46, 48 years, couldn't get them done
trump, I'm good at getting things approved
trump, I have to say
trump, But, we also got accountability where we can fire people that aren't taking care of our vets
trump, If somebody isn't doing a good job, you couldn't fire him
trump, Now you look at him, you say, Get the hell out of here
trump, You're fired
trump, We passed another thing
trump, For 44 years, they've been trying to get it passed, the spectacular Right to Try, where we can use our medicines that are in trial if somebody is terminally ill or very sick, we can use it and we are having tremendous results, Right to Try
trump, I hope that nobody in this room needs it
trump, I hope you don't need it, but if you do, we have the best in the world, and we're seeing amazing results
trump, We're combating the opioid epidemic
trump, Drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 31 years
trump, We are pursuing new advances in neonatal research to care for America's youngest patients and breaking all records in so doing
trump, All of the radical Democrats in the Presidential debates have declared their unlimited support for extreme late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb, right up until the very moment of birth
trump, You know that
trump, That is why at my State of the Union, I asked Congress to prohibit late term abortion for babies, because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God
trump, The Democrat party is the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, blatant corruption, and the total obliteration of your second amendment
trump, That's what it is
trump, The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and the late great Abraham Lincoln
trump, People forget that
trump, People forget Honest Abe
trump, He's the most presidential guy
trump, I've always said I could be more presidential than anybody, but I'm not sure I can beat Honest Abe when he wears the hat
trump, That hat is too much
trump, It's so easy to be presidential, so easy
trump, It's so much easier than doing what I have to do, but you know what I'd have I'd have about three people in the front row
trump, How about sleepy Joe How about his performance What What It's great to be with the great people of Ohio
trump, Joe, Joe, you're in Iowa
trump, You're an Iowa
trump, Oh, wow
trump, He did it five times
trump, So far, I've never done it
trump, Thank you
trump, I've never done it
trump, If I do it, that's a bad sign
trump, Now he does it all the time
trump, He was in New Hampshire and he said he was in Vermont
trump, It's great to be in Vermont
trump, Joe, you're in New Hampshire
trump, Dammit
trump, He'd go up and tell him again and again
trump, Joe, what the hell is wrong with you, Joe Sleepy Joe
trump, He's sleepy Joe
trump, He was sleepy a long time ago, but now he's really sleeping
trump, But it's easy to be presidential
trump, You know that
trump, The easiest thing you could do is presidential
trump, Never open your jacket
trump, Never
trump, It's got to be buttoned up
trump, Right Ladies and gentleman, the President of the United States

trump, Smart, smart
trump, Smart guy
trump, We do good
trump, We're representing you
trump, I better do good
trump, If I didn't do good, you'd dump me so fast
trump, Actually, I don't think you would dump be so fast, actually
trump, You want to know the thing She said, we're never dumping you
trump, Fake news CNN went up to a woman
trump, What does it take for you to leave the President I'm not leaving him
trump, There were 10 women, and the one woman, beautiful, incredible women, and they had their bandanas, they had hats, Trump, and stupid CNN, they go up, What does it take for you Then he goes, Look, he said one time that his people are so good, they'd stay with him if he shot somebody in the middle of Fifth Avenue
trump, Do you remember Right  Would you stay if he shot somebody This is actually an answer, or something to the effect, Would you say every shot somebody in the middle of Fifth Avenue The woman looks, Well, it depends why he shot him
trump, Makes sense
trump, Depends why he shot him
trump, But then they said, We're not leaving him
trump, We're never leaving him
trump, We're in thing together, folks
trump, We got the swamp
trump, We got that dirty, rotten swamp
trump, We got crooked politicians
trump, We got a lot of bad people, but we're getting them out one by one
trump, We better be, little Adam Schiff, that little Adam Schiff
trump, What a crooked politician
trump, He's a corrupt politician
trump, Talking about guys, he'll lie and then the next day get caught
trump, He'll be sorry that he got caught
trump, The next day he'll walk up to the mic and say exactly the same thing
trump, He's got no shame
trump, He's got no shame
trump, He's a liar
trump, I think he's a sick person
trump, Republicans are fighting for the citizens from every background, every community, and every walk of life

trump, We are asking all Americans to join our incredible movement
trump, We are the big tent
trump, We are the big party
trump, We have the big ideas for the future
trump, Republicans are fighting for school choice, big deal, it's a big deal, because no parents should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school
trump, To uphold the new rule of law, we have confirmed 217 brand new, beautiful federal judges who will interpret the Constitution as written
trump, That's a record
trump, That is a record that it includes 192 judges who are appointed for a lifetime
trump, So, think of it
trump, If they're 40 years old, if they're 45 years old, they can be there for 40, 50 years
trump, As you know, and by the way, that's a record by a lot
trump, I have the record, but there's one record that probably nobody will get the percentage record
trump, Who has the percentage Do you know George Washington, 100
trump, But it was only 16 people
trump, So, with 217, can you imagine that It's a record and we're going up
trump, We're going up
trump, The Democrats are thrilled about that one, and as you know, I have nominated and we have confirmed two great new Supreme court justices, Colorado zone, right Colorado
trump, That's right
trump, Colorado zone, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh
trump, Neil Gorsuch, that's right
trump, Colorado
trump, He's a great guy, too, great guy
trump, Colorado

trump, Another place, the Air Force Academy, you know that, and Schriever, right, Air Force Base Schriever
trump, Schriever
trump, Was that right Schriever, right Schriever, that's a little tricky one
trump, It took me a little while
trump, I'm looking at that sucker
trump, I'm saying, Schriever, right
trump, Thank you
trump, That's very nice
trump, He saw he was having a little trouble with that one
trump, That's tricky
trump, You don't like to mispronounce a word
trump, You come to a great place like this and instead of calling it Fort Carson, you go at Fort crasson, and they say, Oh, this guy doesn't know anything about us
trump, No, a lot of money going into Fort Carson
trump, It's great
trump, For years, you watched as your politicians apologize for America
trump, You saw that
trump, Well, I'd like to apologize
trump, We don't apologize
trump, Now you have a President who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the great people of Colorado
trump, At stake in our present battle is the survival of our nation
trump, If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for, they wanted to secure these great rights that we all have, then we must devote everything we have toward victory in November of 2020, November 3rd
trump, Only this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp once and for all
trump, We'll get it finished
trump, We'll get it finished
trump, They're bad people
trump, They're all over the place
trump, They're bad people
trump, With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity

trump, We will continue to enact great new trade deals like we've been doing
trump, I'm going to India next week and we're talking trade
trump, They've been hitting us very hard for many, many years, but I really like Prime Minister Modi
trump, We got to talk a little
trump, We've got to talk a little business
trump, They've been hitting us hard
trump, They give us tariffs
trump, One of the highest in the world is India
trump, But I hear they're going to have 10 million people, they say anywhere from six to 10 million people are going to be showing up along the route to one of the largest stadiums in the world, the largest cricket stadium in the world, which is brand new and beautiful
trump, But you know what, and the only problem with doing that, Prime Minister Modi said, We will have 10 million people greet you
trump, Here's my problem
trump, We have a packed house
trump, We have a lot of people, thousands of people that couldn't get in
trump, It's going to look like peanuts from now on
trump, I'll never be satisfied with the crowd
trump, If we have 10 million people in India, how can I be satisfied if we fill up a 60,000 seat stadium Big deal
trump, See, I'm getting spoiled
trump, He said, Build a bigger stadium
trump, That's good
trump, Colorado, very good

trump, We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement
trump, We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life
trump, We believe that faith and family, not government bureaucracy, are the true American way
trump, We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag
trump, We live by the words of our national motto, In God We Trust, from Pueblo to Fort Collins, from Denver to Durango, from Black Forest to Broomfield, from Castle Rock to right here in Colorado Springs, we stand on the shoulders of red blooded American Patriots who poured out their heart, and sweat, and soul, to secure our liberty and defend our freedom
trump, Colorado was founded by pioneers and prospectors, cowboys and miners, and ranchers who tamed the wilderness, explored the west, scaled the Rockies, fought the battles, and helped make this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the Earth, and we are making it greater every single day greater than ever before

trump, I love it
trump, There has never been a better time to be a proud Texan and there's never a better time to be a proud American
trump, There never has
trump, Never has
trump, I came from a small town, Alvarado, Texas where we celebrated the incredible revival of American manufacturing and we opened up some beautiful places
trump, I'll tell you, this place is doing great and created in a very short period of time an extra 1000 jobs for Texas
trump, Since my election, we've created 775,000 new jobs across your state including 70,000 Texas manufacturing jobs
trump, They said those jobs had disappeared, didn't they Huh Hey man, our country is once again living by two simple rules, buy American and hire American
trump, The economy is booming
trump, Our people are prospering
trump, Our country is thriving and our nation is stronger than ever before
trump, But the more America achieves, the more hateful and enraged these crazy Democrats become
trump, Crazy
trump, They're crazy
trump, They're crazy
trump, At stake in this fight is their survival of American democracy itself
trump, Don't kid yourself
trump, That's what they want
trump, They are destroying this country but we will never let it happen
trump, Not even close
trump, For three straight years, radical Democrats have been drawing to overthrow the results of a great, great election
trump, Maybe, maybe the greatest election in the history of our country
trump, They want to oppose an extreme agenda
trump, They cannot pass it and they cannot win it at the ballot box
trump, They're not going to win
trump, The not even going to get … they won't come close in 2020
trump, They know it
trump, They know it
trump, They're not going to win it
trump, They say, let's see
trump, What's another idea What's another idea How do we win this election You know, I really don't believe anymore that they love our country
trump, I don't believe it
trump, Crazy Nancy
trump, Think of that
trump, That crazy Nancy
trump, She is crazy
trump, And shifty Schiff
trump, How about this guy He makes up my conversation, which was perfect
trump, He makes up my conversation
trump, He sees what I said
trump, It doesn't play well because it was perfect
trump, So he made up a totally false conversation with the Ukrainian president and we caught him cold
trump, Everybody knew it anyway
trump, See, we did one thing
trump, You always have to do the unexpected
trump, They never thought I'd released the conversation with the Ukrainian president
trump, I want to get him before Congress and I want to see what he has to say
trump, You know, they say he has immunity
trump, Why would you have immunity for outright fraud Why do you have immunity Why He's a fraud
trump, We're fighting a campaign against leftist, socialist, and globalists who want to return to reckless wars, open borders, rampant crime, and totally disastrous one way trade deals
trump, We're changing that one around very quickly
trump, They believe America is the world's piggy bank and that your tax dollars should subsidize the economy, military and defense of every other nation in the world but our own
trump, It's not happening anymore
trump, Our political opposition made its fortune selling out our nation and its citizens
trump, And you know that's what's been happening
trump, And that's why 2016 was so important
trump, And that's why 2020, I can never say it's more important, but you know it's like the roots of a tree
trump, You plant the baby tree, it's got to catch, get that extra time
trump, We'll have more tax cuts
trump, We'll have even … I'll tell you what, we have rebuilt our military
trump, What we've done has never been done before
trump, The do nothing democrats have betrayed our country and that great betrayal is over
trump, We are finally again, and we've been doing it now for almost three years
trump, Can you believe we've been doing this for three years Can you believe it I've been a politician for three years
trump, I can't believe that
trump, I never thought I'd be called a politician
trump, I don't like it
trump, But it is what it is
trump, But we're finally again putting America first
trump, The radical Democrats want to destroy America as we know it
trump, They want to indoctrinate our children and teach them that America is a sinful, wicked nation
trump, You see that happening all the time
trump, And I know it from personal experience
trump, What they want to teach your kids, not good
trump, They come home, mommy, daddy, this is what I learned
trump, And you're going, oh no, don't tell me
trump, Let's get them into another school fast
trump, They want to disarm law abiding citizens
trump, They want to take your guns away
trump, They want to install far left judges to shred our constitution
trump, It's not happening
trump, They want to tear down symbols of faith and drive Christians and religious believers from the public square
trump, They want to silence your voices on social media and they want the government to censor, muzzle, and shut down conservative voices
trump, You know that
trump, If they didn't hate our country, they wouldn't be doing this to our country
trump, They wouldn't be doing it because they know better
trump, They know better
trump, As an example, we're building a great wall along the Southern border and it's going up rapidly
trump, Going up
trump, And you know, five years ago almost every one of them wanted a wall until I came along and I said, we're going to build a great wall because they could never get it done
trump, Then they stopped the funding
trump, They made it almost impossible
trump, Few people would've been able to do what we did, but we got it from here and we got it from there and we got it from all over the place and we're building that sucker right now and it's having a tremendous effect already
trump, Not easy
trump, Highest level
trump, Everything we said it would be, it's moving rapidly
trump, Although the fake news back there, they don't want to talk about it
trump, They don't want to talk about it
trump, Look at all those cameras
trump, You believe it
trump, Look at all those red lights
trump, Don't worry
trump, I won't say anything bad about your network because a lot of times I get ready to do a number of these phony networks and you know, you see those red lights go off, off, off, off
trump, They don't want their viewers to see it, but that's okay
trump, I'm not going to say it tonight
trump, I'm going to say you're legitimate media
trump, I don't actually mean that
trump, But you look at that
trump, But look at all those cameras
trump, You know that's like the Academy Awards used to be before it failed
trump, You know why it failed You know why it failed Because they came after us
trump, That's why it failed
trump, It failed because they had stupid people saying horrible things about us
trump, Stupid
trump, stupid people
trump, They are stupid people and their ratings have dropped like a rocket
trump, I love seeing it
trump, I'm telling you
trump, Love it
trump, But no matter how hard they try, they will fail because the people of Texas and the people of America will never surrender our freedom to those people right there
trump, We will stand strong for family, faith, God, and for country
trump, Last week, a very dumb Democrat candidate for president, that's the end of him in this state, pledged to revoke the tax exempt status of many churches and religious charities
trump, By the way, that was after a few weeks ago
trump, He said, excuse me, we're going to take your guns away
trump, That doesn't work well with me
trump, I called him right
trump, Remember the flailing arms Nobody noticed it
trump, I noticed it
trump, The flailer
trump, You remember he was flailing all over the place
trump, I said why is this guy hot John Cornyn's going to win so easily
trump, Just like Ted Cruz won
trump, He's going to win no matter what happens
trump, But John Cornyn is not talking about Beto anymore because Beto, in a few short weeks got rid of guns and got rid of religion
trump, Those are not two good things in Texas to get rid of
trump, I will never allow the federal government to be used to punish Americans for their religious beliefs
trump, I will never allow the IRS to be used as a political weapon, except in the case of myself where they use it against me
trump, The radical left tolerates no dissent
trump, It permits no opposition
trump, It accepts no compromise
trump, These people are crazy
trump, And it has absolutely no respect for the will of the American people
trump, First it was the Russia hoax
trump, Then it was the smearing which continues, that disgraceful, disgusting smearing of a fine man, Justice Kavanaugh
trump, And now they continue the outrageous impeachment witch hunt with nothing
trump, With nothing
trump, They come after me, but what they're really doing is they're coming after the Republican party and what they're really, really doing is they're coming after and fighting you
trump, And we never lose
trump, I'm fighting for everyone who believes in the values, traditions, and principles that have made our nation the greatest in the history of the world
trump, And I have to say this, we are far greater now than ever before
trump, You go back four years, you go back seven, six, eight, even you go back into another administration, you go back 10 and 12 years, where were you compared to where you are right now We must hold the Democrats accountable for their lies and their corruption
trump, They are corrupt people
trump, And we must show and vote and we have to go out and we have to win this election coming up
trump, It's going to be a landslide and we have to make it a landslide
trump, Today's do nothing democrats, they don't do anything
trump, Where's the USMCA Everybody wants it
trump, The Democrats even want it and crazy Nancy won't let anybody vote on it
trump, She's nuts
trump, Today's Democrats believe anyone who opposes them must be crushed
trump, It's not just like, let's win
trump, You know, I have to say this
trump, The Republicans said, I'm not sure I like this because my life hasn't been this way, but the Republicans play a much softer game
trump, They really do
trump, When all of our stars, and we have great stars, when they went to our speaker of the house at the time and they asked for subpoenas, oh, let's take it easy
trump, Let's … okay
trump, I mean, I get that too
trump, She hands them out like it's cookies
trump, Here
trump, Subpoena
trump, I heard a commentator who happens to be standing right there the other day
trump, Doesn't like us at all
trump, But said, I've never seen anyone hand out so many subpoenas
trump, I have people getting subpoenas I never heard of
trump, I said, who are those people Never saw anything like it
trump, It's a disgrace what they're doing to our country
trump, We became, because of what they do, not the Republicans and not what we've done because what they've done and what they see
trump, When people come to my office, which is now the oval office, which is your office too
trump, Presidents, Prime Ministers, Kings, Queens
trump, I hate to say it
trump, Sometimes dictators, they just don't like to go by that title
trump, They say, sir, congratulations sir on what you've done
trump, Congratulations on what you've done
trump, It's incredible
trump, Your economy is the greatest on earth
trump, And let me tell you it, if my crooked opponent would have won the election right now China would be by far the number one nation from an economic standpoint in the world
trump, We've gone up trillions of dollars
trump, They've gone down trillions of dollars, and we are so far number one, so far that they'll never catch us if we are smart right here
trump, But the do nothing Democrats believe anyone who opposes them has to be crushed
trump, They don't want to just beat them
trump, They don't want to just beat him
trump, These are sick people
trump, They want to crush these people
trump, The anger, the hatred, and that any lie or crime or corruption is justified so Schiff gets up and makes up my statement
trump, He makes it up 100 and then he said he didn't speak to the whistle blower
trump, No, we didn't see the whistleblower
trump, And what about the whistleblower The whistleblower got it all wrong
trump, Who's the whistleblower Who's the whistleblower Who is the whistleblower We have to know
trump, Is the whistleblower a spy And who is the IG that did this All he had to do is look at the tape or look at what they wrote down, the transcribed version of the phone call
trump, Compare that to the whistle blower's account and you see it had nothing to do with it
trump, So why does the IG allow a thing like this to happen to our country Why Why Got a lot of bad people out there, but one by one we're advancing
trump, One by one
trump, Just look at the terrible foreign corruption of the Bidens
trump, I hate to talk about him
trump, You know why I don't think the guy's got a chance
trump, Sleepy Joe
trump, I don't think he's got it
trump, I don't see it
trump, I don't know
trump, I've got these great, brilliant senators over here
trump, I have all these congressmen over here
trump, Fellows I don't think he has a chance
trump, I'd like him to
trump, I'd like him to
trump, You know I thought Pocahontas was gone, left in embers
trump, You got to give her credit
trump, Those embers, they kept going, going, going
trump, Now it looks like she's doing better
trump, But I don't think Joe has a chance
trump, But did you see the other night where CNN, in a totally unsubstantiated statement, the president said this about you
trump, We're so sorry he said that
trump, His son walked out with a billion and a half dollars from China
trump, These were not the same Chinese people I just dealt with
trump, I will tell you that
trump, But Joe Biden was in charge of Ukraine policy while his son with absolutely no energy experience just got thrown out of the Navy like a dog, was paid massive sums of money by a Ukrainian energy company
trump, You know that's called It's called a payoff, folks
trump, He didn't no energy at all, knew nothing about energy
trump, They hired him, paying him massive amounts of money, much more than the 50,000 a month you heard about
trump, That's a lot
trump, That's a lot
trump, But much more
trump, Joe Biden made them go out and fire the prosecutor on tape
trump, But they don't want to show the tape
trump, I had to put it up on my social media site
trump, They don't want to show the tape where he was bragging
trump, You're not going to get this money unless they get rid of … and boom, they got rid of the prosecutor
trump, He was investigating the son and the son's company
trump, Got rid of him
trump, Now that's what you call quid pro quo
trump, While these charges are totally unsubstantiated
trump, These are the fake newsers out there
trump, And then Biden flew
trump, Think of it
trump, He goes into a tough place
trump, We just met such a great deal with China
trump, Just think of this
trump, My guy said, if we could get 20 billion in agricultural product, that would be good
trump, The most China ever did was 16 billion for our farmers
trump, Okay
trump, We're just talking about the farmers
trump, We did banking
trump, We did everything
trump, But we're talking about them
trump, The most they ever did was 20 billion of product from our farmers
trump, Our great farmers
trump, Our patriot farmers
trump, Our farmers that never left us even though they were being targeted by China
trump, They never left me
trump, So they wanted 20 in China agreed
trump, I said, nope, no good
trump, I want 50 billion, not 20 billion
trump, 50
trump, So my guys say, sir, we have a problem, sir
trump, Our farmers cannot produce that much
trump, It's true
trump, I said, tell them to go out and get bigger tractors, right John Deere case, Caterpillar, all American
trump, Only American tractors
trump, We only buy American tractors
trump, Go out and get bigger
trump, So now China's agreed
trump, They've already started buying
trump, Hopefully the agreement gets signed sometime prior to a big summit that we have with president Xi and others in Chile
trump, That's in about four weeks
trump, But they give this
trump, They said, sir, they can't produce 50 billion
trump, I said, I want the farmers to tell me … remember the story about winning We're going to win so much
trump, We're going into the White House
trump, We're going to tell the president, sir, we just can't stand winning
trump, The state of Texas, John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, they're going to come into my office
trump, Sir, we just can't stand this winning in Texas anymore
trump, It's too much
trump, We can't handle it
trump, Well, that's what I want from the farmers
trump, I want the farmers to say
trump, I want the farmers to say, sir, we just can't produce that much product
trump, We can't do it, sir
trump, And I'm going to say yes, you can
trump, And they're going to say, no, we can't
trump, I'm going to say yes you can
trump, And they're going to go out and they get to take in 50 billion from China as opposed to 20
trump, That's what's going to happen
trump, That's what's going to happen
trump, But they were great
trump, They stuck with us through thick and thin
trump, Now it's really working out for a lot of different groups
trump, In the meantime we've taken in tens of billions of dollars of tariffs and China's eaten the cost because they devalued their currency and they put money out
trump, Tens of billions of dollars
trump, It's cost us nothing
trump, Billions and billions and billions
trump, You know what I did for the farmer During the lean times, I gave them 16 billion last year and 12 billion the year before
trump, 28 billion altogether came out of the tariffs that I had a lot of money leftover and nobody complained
trump, You know our farmers didn't want that money
trump, Our farmers didn't want it
trump, True story
trump, Everybody comes for money
trump, Countries come for … everybody wants money, right They all want our money
trump, The farmers said, sir, we don't want this money
trump, It's a subsidy
trump, We don't want it
trump, I said, no, it's not a subsidy
trump, You're being targeted unfairly
trump, They said, no, sir, it's a subsidy
trump, This is true
trump, I had 35 farmers in the oval office
trump, Incredible people
trump, They didn't want it
trump, They said, sir, just give us a level field
trump, So now I gave them a field that's more than level
trump, It's level like this
trump, Nice and easy
trump, Nice and easy
trump, But the farmers, I call them the great patriots the farmers
trump, I never lost them
trump, They always said, yeah, I'm in trouble
trump, I got a problem
trump, But this should have been done many, many years ago by other presidents and other leaders
trump, And we lose for many years 500 billion a year with China and many other countries we lose billions
trump, We lose with everybody
trump, But that's all changing now
trump, But we lose 500 billion, not million
trump, 500 millions is a lot, right We lose 500 billion
trump, And you know what It's a disgrace that that was allowed to go on for 25 years
trump, It was a disgrace
trump, Disgrace
trump, But now we're taking in billions of dollars
trump, They've had the worst year they've had in 27 years and we're having the best year we've ever had
trump, So that's good
trump, That's good
trump, So Biden flew with Hunter on Air Force 2
trump, They flew to China
trump, Hunter walked out of the plane, had a quick meeting, walked away with one and a half billion dollars
trump, These characters back there said, oh, that's okay
trump, There's no problem
trump, Can you imagine if Don or Eric Trump or Ivanka Trump, who's here someplace … right here
trump, And by the way, our great First Lady is home watching this
trump, She said, this is the most exciting thing I've seen in a long time
trump, You're a great First Lady
trump, Doing a great job
trump, She's doing a great job
trump, We're doing a great job
trump, The whole country now is doing a great job
trump, So Biden takes 1,500,000,000 and he goes on and he allows China to rip us off
trump, Remember he said a year ago No, no, China's good
trump, They've done nothing wrong
trump, They are wonderful people
trump, They are all wonderful people
trump, I don't blame China, by the way
trump, I blame our leaders for allowing this horrible, you know what and pillage
trump, It's the R word
trump, You know what and pillage
trump, You know what word I'm talking about, right I don't want to use it because they'll say it's a horrible word that Trump used
trump, So the Biden's got rich while America got robbed
trump, Tonight we forcefully condemn the blatant corruption of the Democrat party and nobody ever pays the price with the Democrats
trump, They're so deep seeded
trump, They never pay the price
trump, They never pay
trump, But maybe soon that will start
trump, You know, we've had a lot of, we've had a lot of Obama people and Clinton people and some, to be honest with you, we've had some pretty bad Republicans down deep that didn't exactly love us
trump, But slowly they're getting out
trump, They have all sorts of protections
trump, He says get rid of them
trump, Yeah, we're trying
trump, Get rid of them
trump, But their partner in the whole thing is the fake news media
trump, That's the problem
trump, Because the Democrats and the fake news media, it's a partnership
trump, Remember that
trump, And you see it all the time, and I've never seen it to this extent
trump, You know, when I won in the primaries and then I won the election, I was treated horribly by the media, horribly
trump, And then when I won the election, we had the greatest night, one of the highest rated nights in the history of television all over the world
trump, And I won
trump, And I said, oh, the great thing
trump, I said to Ivanka, I said to the first lady, I said to anybody that would listen, I said, listen, this is so great
trump, Finally, finally, we, all of us, we're going to be respected by the media
trump, And you know what happened They got worse
trump, They're worse now than they ever have been
trump, They're crooked as hell
trump, They're worse now than they've ever been
trump, They're crooked
trump, The only message these radicals, and they are radical lefties, will understand is a crushing defeat on November 3rd, 2020
trump, Save that date
trump, With your help, we will win back the house
trump, We … With your help, we will win back the House, we will keep the Senate, and we will keep the White House in numbers like they haven't seen in a long, long time
trump, Joining us tonight are many terrific Republican leaders, and they are terrific
trump, And frankly, if they're not, I'm not going to introduce them, okay But we have some great leaders, and you have great leaders in Texas
trump, Great leaders, and they love Texas
trump, A friend of mine, a guy that a lot of people weren't so sure, we had this unbelievable relationship
trump, In fact, when Ted Cruz held a rally in Washington, he said, Could you come to my rally And everybody thought, these people thought that was strange
trump, They said to me, Well, when is the fighting between these two Because we really like each other
trump, When's the fighting going to start Right, Ted They said, When is the fighting going to start And I said, Don't worry, it'll start
trump, And when it does, it's going to be vicious
trump, And it was vicious, and now we love each other again
trump, He's great
trump, Ted Cruz
trump, And he had a great victory against a man that spent almost 100 million dollars
trump, That's a lot of money
trump, Spent almost 100 million, but that was a great victory
trump, Thank you, Ted
trump, Another man who's currently running against somebody
trump, I kept thinking maybe Beto will jump in because he's at zero right now
trump, We hope he's going to jump in
trump, Remember, no religion and no guns
trump, I think that's not good
trump, Oh, and I think he's like pretty light on oil production too
trump, But a man and John, I have no idea who you're running against, but nobody's going to be able to beat John Cornyn
trump, He's a good man, you're good man, thank you, John
trump, And we have a lot of Congress people here
trump, We have a woman who's fantastic, who has been a fan of ours right from the beginning, Kay Granger
trump, Thank you, Kay
trump, We have a man who's smart as hell and he is tough and he is mean and nasty, but he loves this state and he's only mean and nasty because he wants to defend you and me and all of the horrible things that we all go through, Louie Gohmert
trump, Louie, he's a great guy, been a great friend of mine
trump, I'll tell you once we got him on board, he wouldn't leave us no matter what
trump, And he had Mueller and everybody figured out long before anybody else had it figured out, right, Louie A person who's been an incredible ally, again, loves your state, Randy Weber
trump, Thank you Randy
trump, Great job, thank you

trump, A man I saw on television last night defending me, brilliantly defending me
trump, I actually don't like doing this usually, but I tweeted out, I said, Thank you very much Brian Babin
trump, That was a great defense, I appreciate it
trump, Thank you Brian, that was great last night

trump, Find out who this woman is
trump, She's driving me crazy
trump, She calls me, Just one more trip, sir, one more trip

trump, This includes putting a stop to the catastrophic era of endless wars
trump, Endless wars, they don't stop
trump, They don't stop
trump, They go on forever
trump, We become policemen
trump, We end up becoming police, were policing these countries
trump, That's not what it's about
trump, We've spent eight trillion dollars in the Middle East
trump, Thousands of American soldiers have lost their lives
trump, Tens of thousands more have been severely wounded, and in all fairness, the other side has lost millions of people
trump, Millions, millions of people, think of it
trump, These wars brought mass chaos, instability, destruction and death
trump, Today we choose a different path
trump, We had tremendous success today
trump, I don't know if you've seen it
trump, We built in the last three years, we built the strongest military by far
trump, And I told this story, I was embarrassed to tell it, but now I'll tell, when I first got in, a general told me we could've had a conflict with someone said, Sir, we don't have ammunition
trump, And I said, I never want to hear a president … I just never want to hear somebody have that statement made to them again as President of the United States, we don't have ammunition
trump, Think of how bad
trump, Now we have so much ammunition we don't know what to do with it
trump, And as you all know, I guess you've been watching today
trump, I sent Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Pompeo to lead an American delegation to meet with President Erdogan of Turkey
trump, They got there today and it did work
trump, Without spilling a drop of American blood, not one drop of American blood
trump, We've all agreed on a pause or a ceasefire in the border region of Syria and it was unconventional what I did
trump, I said, They're going to have to fight a little while
trump, Sometimes you have to let them fight a little while
trump, Then people find out how tough the fighting is
trump, These guys know right up here, these guys know, right Sometimes you have to let them fight like two kids in a lot
trump, You got to let them fight and then you pull them apart
trump, But it was unconventional, but they fought for a few days and it was pretty vicious
trump, And the Kurds, who are our friends and Turkey's our friend
trump, But they fought, it was tougher
trump, I mean it was nasty and you couldn't make a deal for 15, think of it, for 15 years, 20 years, they couldn't make a deal
trump, The Kurds didn't want to move
trump, Turkey didn't want to budge, and Turkey was having a lot of bad things happen from this region
trump, In all fairness to Turkey, they were having a lot of bad, but they didn't … Now all of a sudden they're fighting and it's not fun having bullets going all over the place
trump, And we went there and we said, we want to pause, and the Kurds have been terrific
trump, They're going to move back a little bit
trump, We're going to keep ISIS all nice and locked up, okay
trump, We're going to find more of them
trump, And Turkey's all set and President Erdogan one was great and we're going to take the worst sanctions and tariffs and everything that I put on the country, we put the worst, I mean, I don't think they could have economically survived, but that doesn't matter
trump, President Erdogan was a gentleman
trump, He understood it, but without a little tough love
trump, You know what tough love is, right Without a little tough love, they would have never made this deal
trump, President Obama lost a million people in the area, a million people, a million people
trump, So now we're doing a five day period, we're going to see if we can get it all finalized and I think it will be, I think it will be
trump, So Turkey's going to be happy
trump, The Kurds are going to be happy, ISIS is going to be unhappy
trump, We'll deal with whoever we have to deal with, but we'll get it done
trump, And it's a great tribute to a lot of very talented people and thank you to Vice President Pence and thank you to Mike Pompeo
trump, Good job, good job and they're traveling back to our country by night
trump, They're traveling back and they'll be back soon and we'll have a big conference on it
trump, But it was a terrific thing and we've taken care of a lot of religious persecution
trump, We added that in
trump, A lot of things are in that agreement that nobody ever thought possible
trump, So we have to fundamentally change our approach to Homeland Security as an example
trump, In that example, nobody would've ever done that
trump, You have to be a little bit different to do it that way
trump, I took a lot of heat, even from some of our Congressman, even from some of our Senators, but now they're all happy and I'm happy with them
trump, I'm happy with them
trump, Now, I don't know what about the Democrats The Democrats will say, Oh, what a terrible … Anything we do the Democrats will criticize
trump, If I said, like on the China deal, We get Beijing for one dollar
trump, They would say, What a terrible deal
trump, It just doesn't work with them
trump, You know the wall
trump, We spend so much time with them on the wall and I realized about two weeks ago, all I had to do is say, We will never build a wall
trump, And they would have come through and they said, We demand that you build it
trump, It would have been so much easier, right
trump, Would have been so much easier, Ted, would've been so much easier
trump, American combat troops should not be at the center of ancient sectarian conflicts all over the world
trump, Bring our soldiers back home
trump, Bring our soldiers back home
trump, The same people pushing us to fight endless wars overseas want us to open our borders to mass migration from these war torn and terror afflicted regions
trump, Their policies would import terrorism right onto our shores with American issued visas
trump, Oh, isn't that wonderful And by the way, the Democrats want open borders
trump, They want everybody to flow in
trump, They want those caravans to flow in, the caravans
trump, And they wouldn't get rid of the loopholes
trump, But you know what Mexico's been great
trump, Mexico today had 27,000 soldiers on our border and we've stopped this horrible migration of people
trump, And many of them are bad people
trump, You know when countries send them up, they're not sending their finest, okay, use your heads, they're not sending their finest
trump, You've got to see some of the people
trump, But now we send them back
trump, And by the way, ICE is fantastic
trump, They've taken out thousands and thousands of MS-13 killers
trump, They've taken thousands of killers and brought them back
trump, And now we've made deals with Guatemala and Honduras and El Salvador and Mexico
trump, But we've made deals now where we can bring back, there are 45,000 people waiting in Mexico
trump, But it's going to be very tough for these people ever to get back
trump, When did you ever hear that Used to have no people waiting in Mexico
trump, They just flooded
trump, Our borders are getting strong
trump, When the wall is complete, there'll be as strong as any borders anywhere in the world
trump, My administration believes in a simple principle, the best way to keep foreign terrorists out of America is deny them, just deny them admission in the first place
trump, It's really pretty simple
trump, And that is why I have imposed, and we had passed and we won at the United States Supreme Court, a travel ban on some of the world's most dangerous countries and places
trump, But if Democrats seize power, they would throw the floodgates wide open, wide open
trump, We would have people coming into our country, look at what's going on in California and the people of California don't want it, they say, come into California
trump, We'll give you free healthcare, free education
trump, Why wouldn't … I may even move to California if they keep going
trump, No, but all it does is it brings everybody in
trump, What's wrong with these people We're rebuilding our military stronger than ever before and we are not going to deplete it again on stupid, senseless, endless wars
trump, We've invested more than two and a half trillion dollars restoring our armed forces and all of it was built in the USA and that includes approving the construction of almost 200 F-35 fighters, stealth, stealth
trump, And many of them are built right here, right here
trump, You know that right, in Fort Worth
trump, As we restore our security, we're also restoring our prosperity
trump, America is winning again and America is respected again
trump, And by the way, I have to say this, so outside they have close to 30,000 people
trump, And I wonder if I could ask the Fire Marshal, fill up this little area, let them in, it would be so nice
trump, You know they have a certain max, we broke the record tonight
trump, Good place
trump, Last month, unemployment reached its lowest level in 51 years
trump, Seven million Americans have been lifted off food stamps since the election
trump, What a great … One point three million children have been lifted out of poverty, think of that
trump, And African American, Hispanic American and Asian American unemployment rates have reached the lowest levels in history
trump, Our great Hispanic American population has reached a poverty level, which is a all time low in U
trump,S
trump, history
trump, And after years of stagnation, wages for Hispanic Americans are rising fast, up nearly eight percent since my election and everybody in the fake news would have said that's absolutely impossible
trump, Medium income, think of this, median income for Hispanic Americans has surpassed 50,000 a year for the first time ever
trump, With Republicans in Congress, we passed the largest package of tax cuts and reform by far in American history
trump, By the way, the Democrats want to raise your taxes, you know
trump, I don't mean a little bit
trump, I don't mean a little bit
trump, I mean like double them up, triple them up and it's still won't pay for the nonsense they want
trump, We eliminated a record number of regulations and we ended the war on a thing called American energy, which is very good for Texas
trump, Since my election, natural gas production in Texas has increased 35 and oil production has increased by 60, six oh
trump, And the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world, world
trump, Yet every major Democrat running for president wants to abolish all production of oil and natural gas
trump, I think they want to go to windmills, windmills, you know
trump, Darling, I want to watch Trump speak tonight
trump, We can't darling, the wind isn't blowing
trump, They want windmills
trump, In other words, they want to annihilate your Texas economy
trump, Can you imagine No more oil, no more natural
trump, So here we have a few people, right No guns, no religion, no oil, no natural gas
trump, Abraham Lincoln could not win Texas under those circumstances
trump, Couldn't do it, couldn't do it, Ted
trump, Couldn't do it, Louis
trump, Abraham Lincoln, Honest Abe, couldn't do it, Louie, right Remember I used to say I can be more presidential, look
trump, I've always said I can be more presidential than any president in history except for Honest Abe Lincoln when he's wearing the hat
trump, That's tough, that's tough
trump, That's a tough one to beat
trump, No, it's much easier, being presidential is easy
trump, All you have to do is act like a stiff, look
trump, Remember the last election, they said these phonies in the back, they said, Texas is in play
trump, They said you'd toss in play too
trump, And I came here, we had rallies like this
trump, Thousands of people outside that couldn't get in
trump, And I said, Why is Texas in play They say because it's voting, it's suppression
trump, They try and get your hopes down
trump, They're suppressed
trump, This is just like fake news
trump, But they said Texas, they said Texas is in play
trump, Ladies and gentlemen, Texas is play
trump, This is CNN, Texas is in play
trump, President Trump … And I had guys on from Texas and they're wearing cowboy hats
trump, Sid and a lot of guys
trump, They go, I don't know about you, but I know something about Texas and Donald Trump is not going to lose Texas
trump, I can tell you that and Texas is not in play
trump, 00 o'clock and usually they have to take hours and sometimes at least even if it's big, they take a half an hour
trump, The Texas polls have closed and usually if it's close, it takes hours
trump, And if it's not even just like so close, it takes a long time
trump, So they go, Ladies and gentlemen, the polls have closed in the State of Texas
trump, Donald Trump has won the State of Texas
trump, Right, Donald Trump
trump, And we won by a lot
trump, We won by a lot
trump, And we won Florida and we won South Carolina and we won Georgia and we won North Carolina and we won Pennsylvania
trump, We won a lot
trump, Remember these phony people, there is no way to get to 270 you had to get to … So I kept going to Maine
trump, I love Maine, but Maine too, you get one
trump, It's cut in half
trump, Maine too you get one
trump, I went there four or five times because … They got me up, the phonies, they got me up to 269, couldn't get to 270 so I went … I won, by the way, I won Maine too
trump, I got one
trump, But I went there and I went there a lot
trump, That's the beautiful thing about the electoral college, you go everywhere
trump, You don't just spend the three … winning the popular vote would be much easier
trump, I'd rather have that
trump, I'd go to four states and relax
trump, I went to 21 States
trump, I used to be a believer in the other, but I think winning … It's like you're a track star
trump, You're working out for the a hundred yard dash or the mile, it's a different form of training
trump, It's a different form
trump, But we did great
trump, They said he cannot get to 270 and they were right
trump, We got to 306
trump, After decades of economic surrender, I have taken historic action to confront China's- … have taken historic action to confront China's rampant trading abuses, and we've made great progress
trump, And our relationship with China is fantastic, and great things are happening
trump, You watch
trump, They get it now
trump, They get it
trump, And a lot of good things are happening
trump, We're replacing NAFTA with disastrous, I mean, it's been, to me, probably … I used to call it the worst trade deal in history
trump, I think the World Trade has been … WTO, what a real beauty, the World Trade Organization
trump, That's a real beauty
trump, They consider China a developing nation
trump, And because you're a developing nation, Ted, right They consider China to be a developing nation, and because they're developing, they get tremendous … And we wrote them letters
trump, We don't consider them to be a developing nation
trump, We don't consider India to be a develop… because they're ripping us off
trump, And we didn't win any cases at the WTO, and now we just won 7
trump,5 billion of countries that were taking taking advantage of us
trump, And we've won a lot of cases lately
trump, We didn't win anything for years practically
trump, Now we've won a lot of cases
trump, You know why Because they know I'll leave if they don't treat us fairly
trump, They know it
trump, And then the piggy bank is gone where they all rob from
trump, We're replacing the NAFTA disaster
trump, And we have to get this crazy Nancy Pelosi to put this thing up for a vote
trump, We have to get her
trump, And the USMCA is a giant victory for Texas farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, workers, and oil
trump, The Democrats should pass it, overwhelmingly
trump, They will
trump, But Nancy has to put it up for a vote
trump, Do-nothing Democrats
trump, They're do-nothing
trump, Nowhere is the Democrat betrayal of our nation more dramatic than on immigration
trump, In recent debates, did you see these debates Do you believe what I'm competing with I don't know, when I had to compete with Ted Cruz, that was brutal
trump, He was the national debate chamption, a story I've never told
trump, I never did that before, right I ran for office
trump, All of a sudden, I'm supposed to be debating tomorrow night
trump,  Who are these people The hell, I don't know all of them
trump, I know a lot of them
trump, I contributed to a lot of them
trump, They used to treat me very nice when I contributed to them
trump, Not so nice when I was their opponent, that changed a lot
trump,  Let me see, I want to see, who are these people I'm going to a debate
trump, I never debated
trump, My whole life has been a debate, but I never debated with a podium, and this, and that
trump,  Who are they And we had 17 people, plus me
trump, We had 18
trump, It was actually not 17, it was 18
trump, Remember Gilmore Nobody remembers him
trump, But we had 18 people
trump, I said, Who are these people Are they any good at debating And I hired a debate coach, and he lasted for about 10 minutes
trump,  This guy knows less than I do
trump, He didn't know anything
trump, He didn't know anything, it's true
trump, He said, Never ever interrupt while they're speaking
trump,  Okay, coach
trump, Put me in, coach
trump, And after a couple of those statements, I mean … I mean, you can't beat Ted Cruz if you don't interrupt him
trump, It's impossible
trump, But my first … It's true
trump, So I see, Let me see the cards
trump, Let me see the whole thing
trump, I want to see it
trump, I need help
trump, I'm going to be debating in front of millions of people
trump, And everyone's saying, Do you think Trump's going to be able to debate professionally  Let me see these cards
trump,  You know, he was president of his class
trump, One guy was a good debater in college
trump, He was this, he was okay
trump, But they give me the first card, Ted Cruz, and it says, National debate champion from Princeton
trump, Is that right And then, National debate champion from Harvard
trump,  My potential first lady, I got a problem
trump,  Some of these guys are okay
trump, They were only president of the class
trump, Almost all of them ran for president of the class
trump, I never did
trump, I liked playing baseball better
trump, But I said, Melania, and I called Ivanka, I called my kids, I said, I got a problem
trump, Ted Cruz was the national debate, he was the number one guy in college
trump, He was the number one guy in law school
trump, How the hell do I beat a guy that's that good at debating But we came out okay, Ted
trump, And Ted, Ted was tough
trump, Smart as hell and tough
trump, Tough
trump, Good man
trump, But it is true
trump, The first card I looked at, seriously, it was Ted Cruz
trump, And he was literally, I mean, national debate, he was the best in all of college and in law school
trump, And he's a talented guy
trump, No, he says
trump, I don't think so
trump, Every single Democrat candidate for president raised their hand in favor of giving free healthcare to all illegal aliens
trump, They want to give more to illegal aliens than they give to American citizens
trump, You see that
trump, As president, I will never allow the Democrats to take away your healthcare dollars and give them to people that are in our country illegally
trump, Can't do it
trump, In fact, I just signed an executive action to protect American healthcare benefits for all American citizens
trump, Among those hardest hit by illegal immigration are millions of legal immigrants right here in Texas, including millions of patriotic, hardworking Mexican-Americans who play by the rules, pay their taxes, follow our laws, and strengthen our communities
trump, Whether you are a first-generation or tenth-generation, and every American citizen, and you do, you've been treated so badly
trump, But you're not being treated badly anymore
trump, You know We got rid of the individual mandate from crazy Obamacare
trump, Every American citizen deserves a government that defends your jobs, your safety, your family, your borders, and is always loyal to you for a change
trump, We're loyal to you
trump, My administration has reduced illegal border crossings by over 60 since May
trump, And that's with no help from the Democrats
trump, They won't close up the loopholes
trump, They won't close the loopholes, and we could do it in 15 minutes
trump, And we're building the wall and we're doing all of these things, but the Democrats won't close up the loopholes
trump, You know what the loopholes are, right How about catch and release You catch them
trump, You say, Hello, darling, how are you Could you please give us your name and phone number They don't have a phone
trump, Could you give us your address They don't want to have That have a phone Could you give us your address They don't want to have an address that's in Honduras
trump, Could you please give us your address and your name They can't
trump, They say, That's okay
trump, We catch and we release, and they go into our country
trump, And then we are getting them out of the country
trump, And you know what Some are very good people
trump, Some are unbelievably dangerous and bad people
trump, And we're focusing on the bad and they're getting the hell out of our country
trump, Okay While we're fighting for shared priorities, the American people, the Democrat Party has never been farther outside of the mainstream
trump, They've gone nuts
trump, Every Democrat running for president is pushing a healthcare agenda that would utterly eviscerate Medicare
trump, My administration will always protect Medicare for our beloved seniors
trump, And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions
trump, Our ambitious campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs has produced the largest decline in drug prices in over 51 years
trump, People don't talk about it
trump, The press will not talk about it
trump, We have news conferences
trump, We tell them this, they will not put it in the press
trump, You have no idea how dishonest the media is
trump, You have no idea
trump, Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up until the moment of birth
trump, And that crackpot governor from Virginia executes the baby after birth
trump, You saw that, right After birth
trump, You remember that one from last year
trump, That's why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion, because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God
trump, Democrats are now the party of crazy politicians, high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption
trump, They're corrupt, like Schiff is corrupt
trump, He's corrupt
trump, The Republican Party is the party of the American worker, the American family, and it's the party of the American Dream
trump, It's also the party of Honest Abe Lincoln
trump, We forget that
trump, We got to use that more often
trump, Don't you think Honest Abe
trump, I liked Honest Abe
trump, We've confirmed … He says Honest Donald
trump, Thank you
trump, Explain that to them
trump, You're right
trump, We've confirmed 152 federal judges to apply the law as written, including two Supreme Court justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh
trump, When I got into office, they say the most important thing a president can do, I actually think it's defense, but they say is the appointment of federal judges
trump, So when I got in, always, when you get in, there are none
trump,  How many do you have I have none
trump, None
trump, So I got to, I say, How many federal judges do I have Sir, you have 142 federal judges
trump, No, you don't understand the question
trump, That's impossible
trump, That would mean that President Obama didn't appoint 142 judges
trump, You get none
trump, Or you're doing a bad job as president because you're representing a different philosophy
trump, Very different
trump,  Actually, sir, the number is 142
trump, We were right the first time
trump,  Obama was … He's such a wonderful president
trump, How are you a wonderful president when the most important thing you can do, you handed over to the Republicans
trump, 142
trump, How is that good I mean, how is that good If I were a Democrat, I wouldn't be too happy about that number
trump, And we'll have a record number of judges by the time our term is over in 16 years, maybe 20
trump, I'm only kidding
trump, I'm only kidding because every time I do that, they say, See, he's assuming control
trump, We have this crazy guy on television
trump, And he goes, You know … he's talking to a guest, he goes, You know he's going to win, don't you You know he's going to win
trump, I mean, we've done a good job
trump, He should be happy
trump, But he said,  Our military, our schools, our this, everything
trump, He says, You know he's going to win
trump, And the guest goes, Well, no, we're going to fight
trump, We're going to fight
trump, No, no, he's going to win
trump, And you know he's never leaving
trump, You know that, don't you He's never leaving
trump, He's never going to leave
trump, And I thought this wacko was kidding
trump, He's a comedian
trump, I thought he was kidding
trump, He's serious
trump, He really believes that
trump, We passed, for the veterans, VA Choice and VA Accountability on behalf of those great people
trump, They've been trying to pass it for almost 50 years
trump, They couldn't get it done
trump, But those guys right there, and me, we got it done
trump, And to protect American security, I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal
trump, I recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem
trump, And we also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights
trump, For years, you watched as your politicians apologized for America
trump, You've seen it many times
trump, Oh, I'm so sorry
trump, Now you have a president who's standing up for America and standing up for your great state of Texas
trump,  about you
trump, I'm doing this for you
trump, You know, we had, in 2016, I really believe it was maybe the greatest election
trump, I guess George Washington was good, right But that was easy
trump, And by the way, he did even better percentage-wise in judges than I did
trump, He had 100
trump, but we could have 50
trump, That's not bad
trump, And I had many more than he had
trump, So I guess you got to give George Washington, what do you think, Ted, you got to give him something I'd say Honest Abe, that was a pretty good election, right Andrew Jackson, they say ours topped Andrew Jackson
trump, But Andrew Jackson was a good election
trump, But we had among the greatest elections of all time
trump, But we have to now cement that election
trump, We got to cement it
trump, And once we do, it's going to be very hard to take this beautiful experiment apart
trump, That'll be very hard
trump, Because it's all about your family
trump, It's all about your future
trump, And it's all about the future fate of our great country
trump, So important
trump, With your help, we will lift millions of more citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity
trump, Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a safe, modern, fair, and lawful system of immigration
trump, And by the way, thank you, Robert Jeffress, for being here, wherever you may be in this massive … Wherever you are, Robert
trump, Where is he He got up, he started saying, He may not be the greatest person
trump, I said … This is like four years ago, I see this guy, what a mouthpiece, this guy
trump, And he's a man of God
trump,  He may not be the greatest, he may not be the most perfect Christian
trump, He may not know the Bible as well as some of us, but he's a leader
trump, And I love Donald Trump
trump,  Who is that guy I love that guy
trump, Robert Jeffress
trump, Wherever
trump, He's a great guy
trump, Got a big, big group of people on Sunday mornings too, I can tell you
trump, We will enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with those beautiful words, that beautiful phrase, I love it, Made in the USA
trump, We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America in less than 10 years
trump, We're doing that
trump, Who would have believed we could do that We're doing that
trump, And the previous administration spent no money on that, and we're spending a lot
trump, But think of that
trump, Who would have thought that we're going to end, within 10 years, the AIDS epidemic in our country Who would have thought we've advanced that far We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms
trump, Above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that unite people all across our land and throughout the great state of Texas
trump, This is a great state
trump, We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States
trump, We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement
trump, Thank you
trump, We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life
trump, We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true bedrocks of our society
trump, We believe in the creeds of self-reliance, personal responsibility, and American independence
trump, We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag
trump, Loyal citizens like you helped build this country
trump, And together, we are taking back this country, our country
trump, We love our country
trump, We're returning power to you, the American people
trump, That's what we've done
trump, From Dallas to El Paso, from Houston to Austin, from the Red River to the Rio Grande, this state was settled by some of the toughest men and strongest women ever to walk on the face of the earth
trump, Texas
trump, This is the state where William Travis, James Bowie and Davy Crockett made their last stand at the Alamo
trump, This is the state where a small band of patriots at the Battle of Gonzalez, armed with a single canon, stared down a foreign army and declared,  Come and take it
trump,  they loved their families, they loved their country, and they loved their God
trump, These courageous Texas patriots did not shed their blood, sweat, and tears so that we could sit at home while others try to erase their legacy, demolish our liberty, and destroy our proud American heritage
trump, We will never, ever allow that to happen
trump, With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working
trump, We are going to keep on fighting
trump, And we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning
trump, We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God
trump, And together we will make America wealthy again
trump, We will make America proud again
trump, We will make America strong again
trump, We will make America safe again
trump, And we will make America great again
trump, Thank you, Texas
trump, Thank you
trump, 
trump, Thank you
trump,
trump,I worked so hard for this state
trump, I worked so hard
trump, You just got two of the greatest trade deals, and add Japan to it, by the way
trump, Let's make it three, 40 billion from Japan, USMCA, all done
trump, China, all done for the farmers
trump, It's done, that I can tell you
trump, You're going to have to get bigger tractors and a hell of a lot more land
trump, You've got to produce a lot of product
trump, I don't know if you can, but, hello Des Moines
trump, It's great to be with you
trump, I'm thrilled to be back in American heartland with thousands of loyal, hardworking American patriots
trump, Great people
trump, This November we're going to defeat the radical socialist Democrats that are right down the street
trump, I mean, I don't even know
trump, I just saw, New York Times, can you believe Failing New York Times… When we leave in 10, 14, 18, 22 years from now, the New York Times will be out of business and so will a lot of others
trump, But, did you see they did a New York Times poll, I think, and Sienna, Sienna, New York Times of Iowa, and they have me pitted against every one of the Socialists, and we're winning by a lot
trump, Everyone
trump, We're beating them all
trump, We're beating them all
trump, We're beating them all
trump, We're beating them like they haven't been beaten before
trump, You know all the noises about their crazy debates, nobody's watching their debates, but it's all about their debates
trump, They don't care about the farmer
trump, Everything out here, they love Trump, and you should love Trump with what I've done
trump, So, we're going to win the great state of Iowa and it's going to be a historic landslide
trump, If we don't win, your farms are going to hell
trump, I can tell you right now
trump, Sell, sell, they'll be saying Sell
trump, No, we love the farmers, and we love the ranchers, and we love the manufacturers, frankly
trump, You got plenty of that too in this state
trump, The great state, and you have a great governor, by the way
trump, You have a great governor
trump, But every day we're achieving extraordinary victories for the citizens of the Hawkeye State
trump, The Iowa unemployment rate has reached an all time low in history
trump, That's not bad
trump, That's not bad
trump, Oh, let's vote for Pocahontas
trump, Let's vote for Bernie
trump, Let's vote for sleepy Joe
trump, He's falling asleep
trump, Joe, Joe, Joe
trump, He always gets the name wrong
trump, How many times has he missed it He's in Iowa
trump, He says, Great to be in the great state of Ohio
trump, They say, Joe, you're in Iowa
trump, You can't do that
trump, No matter how great you speak
trump, If you're Winston Churchill, if you make that mistake at the beginning of your speech, it's over
trump, You might as well just wrap it up
trump, There's the fake news
trump, They would just absolutely destroy you
trump, They would absolutely destroy you
trump, You can't do that
trump, You can't do that, Joe, sleepy Joe, but you have these guys
trump, You have these people
trump, How about Buttigieg Buttigieg
trump, They call him mayor Pete
trump, You know why Because nobody can pronounce his name
trump, Nobody has any idea
trump, Buttigieg
trump, They say, Say edge edge
trump, He presides over a city that's failed
trump, It's doing so badly, in a state that's having the greatest year they've ever had, and they have a great governor also, and they had a great governor
trump, You just heard from him, right The great state of Indiana, so I don't see that one
trump, Go down the line
trump, We have some people
trump, Let's not talk about them
trump, What happened to mini Mike Where is he He's not running
trump, He's skipping four or five states
trump, Mini Mike
trump, I've had him up to here
trump, More people are working right now in Iowa than ever before
trump, Now think of it
trump, Think of it
trump, Yesterday we replaced a NAFTA disaster with the incredible brand new U
trump,S
trump, Mexico Canada Agreement
trump, The USMCA, you know when you have a hard time with that one, memory is a great thing
trump, I've always had a great memory for whatever reason, but memory is a great thing
trump, Having a great memory, but sometimes you take little clues
trump, USMCA
trump, Thank you, darling
trump, I love you, too
trump, Where is that person up Look at that
trump, Wow
trump, What a good, strong voice
trump, But you know how you remember it The song I just walked in on
trump, They're playing the song YMCA
trump, So, when you're having a hard time, gee, what's U-S, just think of the song YMCA, and you'll remember it, USMCA
trump, It's a massive win for Iowa farmers and workers of all kinds
trump, It's a massive win and it creates some fairness with Canada
trump, It creates fairness with Mexico
trump, Probably the biggest reason that I ran was the unfair trade that I've seen, and one after one, China, Mexico, Canada, Japan, South Korea, we've made all these deals, and we have plenty left over
trump, Plenty left over
trump, Europe, Europe, Europe is next
trump, I wanted to finish China before we started on Europe
trump, I like to do them one at a time, one at a time
trump, I'm a very organized person
trump, But weeks ago we also signed a terrific new trade agreement with China that will boost American agriculture by 50 billion every year, and many other businesses like manufacturing, banking, finance, overall 250 billion, and you know with the farmers, because I have a place in my heart for the farmers big
trump, I went and I saw Ambassador Lighthizer's in charge, he's fantastic
trump, I said, What are you doing We're getting ready for the final deal
trump, What are you doing He said, I'm putting in 20 billion
trump, Because I asked Sonny Perdue
trump, He's great
trump, You know who he is, right Secretary of Agriculture
trump, I said, Sonny, what's the biggest number that China's ever done with the farmers He said, Sir, 16 billion last year
trump, 16 billion
trump, This was two years ago
trump, I said, So, 16 billion is the biggest, because you know, they targeted you, and now we're friends with China
trump, In fact, maybe we've never had a better relationship and were working with them very closely on the Coronavirus
trump, We're working with them very, very closely
trump, We only have five people
trump, Hopefully everything's going to be great
trump, They have somewhat of a problem, but hopefully it's all going to be great
trump, But, we're working with China just so you know, and other countries very, very closely, so it doesn't get out of hand, but it's something that we have to be very, very careful with, right We have to be very careful
trump, But I said to Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture, I said, Sonny, what's the number 16 and 12 the year before, and you were targeted
trump, I don't blame China
trump, Look, they're smart
trump, They're negotiators
trump, They targeted Trump states
trump, Where do they love Trump They love him in Iowa
trump, They love him in Nebraska
trump, They love him in all these states
trump, They love him in Wisconsin
trump, They love him
trump, We won Wisconsin
trump, They like him and Wisconsin, and a lot of the farm states, and they targeted
trump, The farmers came to see me and they said, Sir, you have to do what's right
trump, When the fake news would interview farmers, the farmers would say, No, no, President Trump is doing the right thing
trump, It should have been done years ago
trump, Should've been done years and years ago
trump, But you couldn't have made it because there was too much money, 16 billion
trump, So, what I did is I put a 25 tariff on everything coming in from China, 250 billion, and then more tariffs on things beyond the 250 billion market
trump, We took in billions, and billions, and billions of dollars
trump, We still are, and then what happened When I heard about the farmers and I saw the farmers, they were in the White House
trump, They came to see me
trump, I had 36 farmers and I said, I'm going to give you
trump, They said, Sir, we don't want anything
trump, I said, What do you mean you don't want anything I've never heard that before
trump, Everybody wants money
trump, They want every
trump, They said, We just want a level playing field
trump, I never forgot it
trump, They said, We don't want anything
trump, We just want a level playing field, and we've been treated badly for years, for years
trump, I said, Well, you haven't been given a level playing field for many, many years, for decades
trump, You haven't been given a level playing field
trump, We're going to give you the levelest field that you ever had
trump, But, but in the meantime, I'm going to give you 12 billion, out of these tens of billions that we're collecting
trump, Don't worry
trump, We had plenty of left over, because we never got 25 cents from China
trump, China took from us
trump, We didn't take from China, right I said, I'm going to give you 12 billion for the year before, and I'm going to give you 16 billion for this year
trump, That was last year for this year
trump, So, they got, meaning you, a lot of you in this audience, got 12 billion, and you got 16, so you got 28 billion over that short period of time, and you were able to actually, in some cases, I guess thrive
trump, I told Sonny, I want to take care of the small farmer too, not just the big monsters
trump, I want to take care of everyone, everyone
trump, But, I never forgot when CNN fake news and all these people, they go around interviewing the farmers
trump, They could never find anyone saying bad about Trump
trump, They'd go into diners
trump, What do you think about Trump Isn't it a terrible what he's doing with the trade The farmer would say, No, he's doing what should have been done 20 years ago
trump, Now, you people are going to make so much money
trump, You're not going to do just, you know what Just relax
trump, Take it easy
trump, Put it away
trump, Enjoy your life
trump, But you're going to make a lot of money
trump, You're going to make a lot of money
trump, Again, we have never had, because they respect us now, they didn't respect us
trump, We have never had a better relationship with China than we do right now
trump, It's a beautiful story
trump, They respect us
trump, The whole world respects us now
trump, We're respected again
trump, America is respected again
trump, Okay We're fighting for products made in America and grown right here in this great, great state of Iowa
trump, To keep America safe, we have fully rebuilt the United States military
trump, It's now stronger, more powerful, more lethal than ever before
trump, We have all brand new equipment and it was all built in the USA
trump, Thanks to the courage of American heroes, the ISIS caliphate has been totally destroyed and its founder and leader, the animal known as al-Baghdadi is dead
trump, Crazy Nancy Pelosi said, Don't call him an animal
trump, He's a human being
trump, No, he's an animal
trump, He's an animal
trump, Two weeks ago, at my direction, the United States military delivered another historic win for American justice
trump, Our brave warriors launched a flawless precision strike that killed the world's number one terrorist, Qasem Soleimani
trump, Qasem Soleimani
trump, He was the mastermind of the road side bomb
trump, He loved roadside bombs
trump, When you see your friends and great soldiers of our country and other countries, frankly, walking around, they don't have legs, they don't have arms in some cases
trump, Some cases they don't have both
trump, You see them walking around, or riding around, or the most brave people, these people have the greatest attitude
trump, I go to Walter Reed and I see him and the young man his legs were blown off
trump, How you doing Sir, I want to get back
trump, I want to get back, sir
trump, I'll tell you, the spirit of these people, it may even top the farmers
trump, It may even top the farmers, which is pretty good
trump, But he was responsible, more than anybody else, 90 they say of these roadside bombs sent to fight us, he was responsible and he took a hard hit
trump, He took a very hard hit
trump, He was responsible for murdering and maiming thousands and thousands of Americans, and hundreds of thousands of other people
trump, Not acceptable
trump, Soleimani was actively planning new attacks, but we ended his bloody rampage forever
trump, Yet, Washington Democrats, true, like crazy Bernie and Nancy Pelosi, opposed our decision to eliminate Soleimani, and to save American lives
trump, That had a tremendous impact
trump, While we're proudly creating jobs and killing terrorists, Congressional Democrats are consumed with partisan rage, and obsessed with a deranged witch hunt hoax
trump, You know, we're having probably the best years that we've ever had in the history of our country, and I just got impeached
trump, Can you believe these people I got impeached
trump, They impeached Trump
trump, The best trade deals, the strongest military, I took care of the vets
trump, We got choice
trump, We got accountability for the vets, accountability
trump, We got all these things and they impeach your President
trump, No, that's not going to work
trump, Watch, just watch
trump, They want to nullify your ballots, poison our democracy, and overthrow the entire system of government
trump, That's not happening, I can tell you that
trump, Washington Democrats have spent the last three years trying to overturn the last election
trump, Why am I not worried I should worried
trump, Remember Nixon, it was like a dark period, right It's a very dark period
trump, It was like oh, you think about it
trump, Right With Clinton it was not good
trump, They say that with Johnson, it was a long time ago, none of us remember, but they say it was a very dark period
trump, This is a happy period for us
trump, It's a happy period
trump, It's a happy period because we call this impeachment light
trump, This is light
trump, Crazy Schiff
trump, Shifty Schiff
trump, He's a sick puppy
trump, He's a sick puppy
trump, But, you know what Today you saw it, I hit my highest poll numbers since I got elected because the American people, and frankly, people all over the world, know it's a hoax
trump, They understand it
trump, They know it's a hoax, and we have a great party, the Republican party
trump, They know what's going on
trump, They know what's going on and they're going to treat us very fairly
trump, But, the Democrats are trying to overturn the last election
trump, We will make sure that they face another crushing defeat in 2020
trump, November 3, November 3, mark it off
trump, November 3, mark it off
trump, Was that a great day 2016 November
trump, Remember He's not going to do well with this group
trump, I did well
trump, He's not going to do well with that group
trump, I won that group
trump, He's not going to do well here or there
trump, Even the exit polls, they took it right up
trump, You know what they didn't know about the exit polls When people are leaving, they're always very accurate
trump, People leave
trump, Who you voted for I voted for Trump
trump, Who you voted for I voted for crooked Hillary
trump, I don't care that she's a stone cold crook
trump, I'm voting for her
trump, Who are you voting for I'm voting for Trump, or Clinton, or Trump
trump, They're always very accurate, but this time something happened
trump, Many people, many… I like that idea
trump, I like it
trump, I like it
trump, Wouldn't we like to run against her
trump, who's tougher Her, crazy Bernie, Biden, Buttigieg Who would be the closest Buttigieg
trump, I don't know
trump, Maybe we take another crack at crazy Hillary
trump, Would that be okay She was so easy
trump, Remember that speech so innocently given talking about deplorables
trump, Remember Remember deplorables But you know the only thing I didn't understand, I said, That's terrible
trump, But she said another word that was worse
trump, Irredeemables
trump, I said, Boy, shows you how good I am at politics, I said, She's in trouble
trump, She said our people are irredeemable
trump, To me that was worse
trump, Well, it wasn't that word that caught on
trump, It was deplorable
trump, The next day I'm speaking, and women are walking around, I'm deplorable
trump, Everyone's got deplorable
trump, I say, I think she made a bad speech last night
trump, But irredeemable, remember She called them deplorable and irredeemable, and me being so brilliant, I said, I think that irredeemables going to get her
trump, No, deplorable got her
trump, A lot her like lack of ability
trump, Together we are going to win back the House
trump, We are going to hold the Senate, and we are going to keep that beautiful, gorgeous, incredible White House
trump, People don't realize this is a lot of work
trump, I just left Michigan, and Michigan is booming now because of me, meaning, my people
trump, I say to Prime Minister Abe, he's a friend of mine, Shinzo, Japan, You got to do something
trump, You got these massive deficits for our country
trump, You got to open up plants in Michigan fast, Shinzo
trump, Fast
trump, You've got to do it
trump, Yes, I will do it
trump, He'll do it, and he's doing it
trump, Countries are coming in from all over the world
trump, They're going to Michigan
trump, They're coming to Iowa
trump, They're buying your stuff again, like crazy, like crazy
trump, They're going to Ohio
trump, They're going to Pennsylvania
trump, They're going to South Carolina
trump, They're going to North Carolina
trump, They're going to Florida
trump, They're coming in like never before
trump, They're all coming back
trump, I ran on the issue trade
trump, I ran on a lot of different issues, but trade was one of them
trump, That was so big
trump, To me, it was so big
trump, I used to say, how do we allow these companies to close, fire everybody, go to another country Mexico, wherever it may be, make product, sell the product into our country, pay no tax
trump, Who the hell would allow this to happen Who would allow to happen It's like in South Korea
trump, I went to him, I said, Listen, your deal is no good
trump, We have to make a new deal
trump, South Korea, we're protecting them all, all these different things
trump, I said, Number one, you've got to pay us more
trump, They agreed to
trump, They gave us 500 million a year more
trump, They said, But nobody has ever asked
trump, They gave us 500
trump, That's nothing compared to what they have to do
trump, That's okay
trump, That's okay
trump, They'll pay more
trump, But you know, they made a trade deal with the United States
trump, Hillary Clinton was in charge of the deal, right She said it's going to produce 250,000 jobs, and she was right
trump, 250,000
trump, You know who it was for For South Korea, not for us, it was for South Korea
trump, So, we renegotiated the deal, if I have your permission, we renegotiated the deal and now we have a good deal with South Korea, okay This deal is going to produce, remember… This deal is going to produce 250,000 jobs for South Korea
trump, She didn't lie
trump, Can't say she lied
trump, She lies about a lot of other things, but she didn't lie
trump, How is she taking her defeat Okay I think so
trump, Remember the debate Do you promise if you lose that you will support the winner and I sort of, I didn't exactly say yes
trump, I didn't say yes, in all fairness, but I got sort of like six the 68 there
trump, But she said, See he won't
trump, She's the one that doesn't do it
trump, No, no, I feel badly because it's too late for her to get in
trump, I kept hoping, but I think, honestly I think that sleepy Joe, crazy Bernie, I don't even want to put Buttigieg in, but I think they'd actually be tougher than her
trump, During this campaign season, the good people of Iowa have had a front row seat to the lunacy and the madness of the totally sick left
trump, This is a radical left people that we're dealing with
trump, Today's Democrat party, I don't say Democratic party, it sounds so much better in a speech, right Democratic party, the Democrat, but that's not their name
trump, It's called the Democrat party
trump, You know some people aren't allowed to say the Democrat party because it doesn't sound good
trump, I don't even like it
trump, I don't like the way it sounds in this speech, but I'm going to say it because I'm not looking to have them look good
trump, Today's Democrat party is run by left wing extremists who want to massively raise your taxes, increase regulations, cancel your health plans, raid Medicare, shut down American energy, destroy your social security, they will destroy your social security, eliminate religious liberty, punish free speech, confiscate your guns, abolish your borders, and indoctrinate America's children with hateful, left-wing ideology
trump, Other than that, they're okay
trump, Other than that, they're fine people
trump, In short, this election is a choice between American freedom and Democratic socialism, and in some cases, in my opinion, it's worse than Socialism
trump, Socialism's a kind word by comparison
trump, The Democrats will lose because America will never be a socialist country
trump, We can't
trump, They're all watching tonight
trump, They're sitting in their hotel room, little hotels right down the street, and they're looking at this crowd
trump, The press never talks about my crowds
trump, Did you see in New Jersey a couple of nights ago We had signups for 175,000 people
trump, We had an arena that held about 9,000 people
trump, We could have sold it out 15 times
trump, Okay They don't talk about that
trump, You know what they talk about They said Donald Trump who spoke before a nice crowd
trump, If Bernie or sleepy Joe has, I mean Joe had a crowd that was so small the other day that they set up a round table
trump, No, it's true
trump, No, they were in a gymnasium
trump, There were in a gymnasium, and they set up a round table, and people that went there to hear his speech are now being asked, What do you think of socialism They just said, I just want to be here to watch his speech
trump, They set up a round- They just said, I just want to be here to watch a speech
trump, They set up a round table because the crowd was so small, and then they'll say, It was a brilliant round table
trump, It was wonderful
trump, They never mention crowds
trump, They never mention crowds
trump, They never mention anything
trump, I'll tell you, U
trump,S
trump,M
trump,C
trump,A, The biggest trade deal ever signed in the history of the world
trump, Okay It is, wait
trump, It barely got any mention
trump, We signed it
trump, It barely got any mention
trump, They talk about the impeachment hoax
trump, They talk about all the other stuff, but the trade deal, that is going to change our country
trump, It's going to bring growth
trump, Wait until you see, toward the end of next year, the growth will be astronomical because of the China Trade Deal, the U
trump,S
trump,M
trump,C
trump,A, Japan, South Korea, Europe, when that happens
trump, It will happen because they have no choice
trump, They have no choice
trump, But in the papers, and on the fake news cable shows, and the regular, look, NBC is horrible, the NBC Nightly News, it's terrible
trump, The good news is people don't watch it like they used to, because they don't believe in it
trump, They don't believe in it
trump, And as Sean Hannity would say, MSDNC, you know what MSDNC is, right, so bad
trump, CNN, total fake stuff
trump, Oops, their camera just went off
trump, Look The camera just went off CNN Their camera just went off
trump, That always happens whenever I say CNN, their camera goes off
trump, But Americans, across the political spectrum, were disgusted by the Washington Democrats, the partisan hoaxes, the witch hunts, the con jobs
trump, It's all a con job
trump, And so, they don't love our country, I swear they don't
trump, You look at Nancy Pelosi's district in San Francisco
trump, It was so beautiful, and now it's a disgrace, being watched all over the world
trump, Needles all over the place, everything else all over the place
trump, I'm not going to get into it, washing down into the ocean, washing down onto their beaches, people living in tents if they're lucky
trump, I mean you never saw anything, living on their most important entryways into what was a great city, San Francisco
trump, What's happened And all she does is work on the hoax and work on all of the stuff
trump, Really, these people are very, very bad for our country
trump, We have to take back the House of Representatives, we have to
trump, Registered Democrats and Independents are leaving the Democrat party in droves, and we are welcoming these people, and these great voters, to the Republican Party with wide, open arms
trump, And we are thrilled to be joined tonight by a lot of your great leaders, a lot of your really wonderful people
trump, I'm not going to mention all the names, because all those cameras that are rolling, they don't like it when I do it, but one they don't mind is Governor Kim Reynolds
trump, Come up, Kim, come up here Also first gentleman, Kevin Reynolds, Kevin Kim, come on, come on
trump, You want to say something Great, great job
trump, Thank you
trump, Oh, she was driving me a little bit batty
trump, She would call me up, Kim, you would call
trump, What about ethanol I said Kim, I mean, I'm doing a lot for that place
trump, No, no
trump, We want ethanol
trump, Then, we want biofuel
trump, Then she is asking for things I never even heard of, but we got them all, whatever that hell she wanted, we got
trump, Right And by the way, Joni Ernst and the great Chuck Grassley are right now in Washington fighting for fairness, fighting the hoax, fighting for all of us
trump, They called, they said, Do you mind if we don't go tonight We have to stay
trump, I said, I don't want you to be there
trump, I want you to be where you are because they are fighting for us
trump, They are great people
trump, They are great people
trump, And, they would call too
trump, Chuck Grassley, Joni Ernst, they would call, We got to help our farmers, sir
trump, Yes
trump, Okay, we are going to help the farmer
trump, They were great
trump, Lieutenant Governor Adam Gregg
trump, Thank you, Adam
trump, Thank you, Adam
trump, Great job, Adam
trump, Speaker of the Iowa House of Representatives, a man with really fantastic genes, got to have like the best genes in the world
trump, Although you had an ex-governor here that had very good genes, too
trump, We have his son in the audience, too, but this is Representatives Pat Grassley
trump, Those genes, those two young men have the greatest genes anyone has ever had for politics
trump, Thank you, fellas, thanks
trump, I sent one of them, the father to China, and he's now Ambassador to China
trump, Do you think he is happy Is he happy I think so
trump, I think he is happy
trump, Great Governor, longest serving Governor in history, actually, 24 years
trump, We have the Chairman of the Republican Party of Iowa, Jeff Kaufmann
trump, Great job
trump, And just quickly, we have the world's tallest campaign manager, Brad Parscale
trump, And Republican National Committee Co-Chair, who has done an incredible job, Tommy Hicks
trump, And we have the great negotiator, the great man, Bob Lighthizer with us here, someplace
trump, Where's Bob What a job he did negotiating for you
trump, And we have somebody that you never heard of, somebody that's a fantastic person, but you never heard of, somebody named Sarah Sanders

trump, Say something
trump, Thank you, Sarah
trump, Very popular
trump, She is a terrific person, great person
trump, Thanks to Republican leadership, American now has the hottest economy anywhere on the Planet Earth, not even close
trump, Every Prime Minister, President, King, Queen, Dictator, whatever you want to call them, they all say, How did you do it And, the truth is we have certain advantages, but we also have a people advantage
trump, We have the greatest people in the world
trump, I really mean that
trump, Since the election, we have created seven million new jobs
trump, The average unemployment rate, under my administration, listen to this, is lower than any previous administration in the history of our country
trump, Can you believe that The lowest unemployment rate
trump, African American, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment rates have reached the lowest levels ever recorded, think of that
trump, More than two million millennials, you know what millennials are, young, great people with a lot of future, they have gotten jobs, and their wages have grown by nearly 5 annually
trump, That's a record
trump, Another record is that between the ages of 25 and 34, people are now working, and that's a record, the number of people, 25 to 34
trump, And under the so-called Trump Economy, the lowest paid earners are reaping the fastest gains of any group
trump, And that's a great thing
trump, This is a blue collar boom, and that's a good thing too
trump, That's a good thing
trump, Earnings for the bottom 10 are rising faster than earnings for the top 10 for the first time ever, for the first time ever
trump, And median household income is at an all time high, just for one second, president Bush, eight years, 450
trump, President Barack Hussein Obama, eight years, eight years, 975
trump, President Donald John Trump, two and a half years, not three, because the numbers were taken at two and a half, now it's actually higher
trump, Two and a half years, including the tax cuts which are massive, and including all of the regulatory cuts, and the other things you have gotten, 10,000
trump, Think of it
trump, You have eight years, 450
trump, Eight years, 975
trump, Two and a half years, think of it, 10,000
trump, It's one of the reasons the economy is doing so well
trump, And let the people down the road tell you about that, okay Let them tell you about that
trump, And those tractors that I told you to buy, your tractors will be 60 years old if they have anything to do with it
trump, They will be 60 years old
trump, They will be old, tired, exhausted
trump, Your land will be exhausted
trump, You will be exhausted
trump, We've ended the war on American energy
trump, The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on earth, by far
trump, We are also proudly promoting American ethanol, and I recently approved E15 to be used all year round Biofuel also, but the Socialist Democrats want to shut down American energy
trump, They support Representative Ocasio-Cortez
trump, It's a real beauty
trump, That's a real beauty
trump, That's a beauty
trump, I can't even believe it, but I don't want to knock it, because the Green New Deal, which would crush our farms, destroy our wonderful cows
trump, I love cows
trump, They want to kill our cows
trump, You know why, right You know why Don't say it
trump, They want to kill our cows
trump, That means you are next
trump, And they want to wipe out, totally, Iowa ethanol
trump, They want to wipe it out
trump, But we will never let that side get in, and by the way, that's the least of it
trump, But I don't want to attack the Green New Deal, because they might change it
trump, I said to her the other day, they said, What do you think of the Green New Deal I said, Well, it should be studied carefully
trump, We should look at it, look at it closely
trump, I don't want to talk about until about two months before the election
trump, And then I will tell you how totally insane it is
trump, How about this crazy Senator How about this crazy, crazy Senator from Hawaii They said, I'm totally in favor, not the smartest
trump, She said, I'm totally in favor of the Green New Deal
trump, Well, that would mean there's no more airplanes
trump, Oh They started screaming at her in Hawaii, they said, How the hell are we going to get to Hawaii They said, We're going to build a railroad
trump, She said that would be the world's longest track
trump, It's the world's longest
trump, She doesn't know that they don't want airplanes anymore, and yet they fly around in brand new Gulfstreams, in brand new planes all over the place
trump, They're flying from place to place
trump, They're talking about the carbon footprint
trump, We're going to destroy the carbon footprint What time is my plane taking off, please To lift up forgotten communities, the Republican tax cut launched Opportunity Zones, jobs, and investment, and now rushing into over 60 newly… and this is incredible, brand, newly designated Opportunity Zones right here in Iowa alone
trump, Rich people are investing vast amounts of money
trump, Tim Scott, Senator Tim Scott, South Carolina, came into my office
trump, He said, I have an idea that I have wanted to do for years, but we have never had a president that could pull it off
trump, I said, What is it, Tim And he talked about Opportunity Zones, first time I heard it
trump, And we did it, and there is nothing, nobody has ever seen anything like it
trump, Money is being poured into these communities that would have never been there
trump, What's happening is incredible
trump, Opportunity Zones
trump, Remember it
trump, For decades, politicians ran for office, promising to protect American farmers and workers
trump, You've heard it all your lives, right But then, they went to Washington
trump, They looked at those beautiful marble columns, and that gorgeous ceiling painted, and all that gold, the way they used to build the buildings, they don't build them that way anymore
trump, We could, but they just don't know how
trump, By the way, we're building the wall
trump, You know the wall is over a hundred miles long
trump, It's over a hundred miles long already and moving fast
trump, They went to Washington and they sold you out
trump, That's what happened
trump, They sold your jobs out
trump, They sold everything out
trump, Globalist politicians allowed other countries to raid our factories, ravage our farms, rob our workers, and ransack our communities
trump, But the era of economic surrender is over, because now we are finally putting America first, America first
trump, Before I took office, Washington looked the other way, while China stole our secrets from American agriculture
trump, Your business, what they do scientifically, nobody understands what they have done to a seed
trump, It doesn't sound complicated
trump, It is genius, what they have been able to do, what you have been able to do
trump, But those secrets were being stolen, stolen
trump, And installed massive barriers to your exports
trump, You couldn't do anything with exports, so people, not only China, many, many other places were stealing your secrets
trump, Our new agreement with China will protect our intellectual property and pry open vast new markets for American beef, pork, poultry, seafood, soybeans, rice, dairy, and much, much more
trump, But you know it is true
trump, China is so big
trump, 1
trump,5 billion people
trump, We have 350
trump, 1
trump,5 billion people, think of that, and we are just touching it
trump, This deal will be so big
trump, If it all works out, and you have the best product, the best product in the world, if it all works out, it will just keep expanding
trump, 250 billion will end up being much, much more than that
trump, And, I've told this story before, when we were signing, we were almost finished and I said, How much are the farmers getting Meaning how much are they going to purchase from the farmers
trump, And Ambassador Lighthizer said, We put 20 billion, sir
trump, The highest ever was 16, so we made it 20
trump, I said Make it 50
trump, They said, What And then people, even farm people, said, Sir, we can't produce that much
trump, I said, That's a good problem, not a bad problem
trump, I said, Make it 50, so we now have, in the contract, from 40 to 50 billion worth of purchase
trump, Make it 50, make it 50 Right, Jared I said, Jared, you better make it 50
trump, I want those farmers to come back, say, Sir, sir, we can't do it
trump, We can't produce that much, sir, what are you doing to us I don't think that would ever happen Do you think that would ever, I said they will figure a way
trump, He's going Absolutely not
trump, Nah, I said, Don't make it 20, make it 50
trump, The U
trump,S
trump,M
trump,C
trump,A
trump, is another colossal victory for American agriculture like you have never had before
trump, It's time
trump, We suffered for a year and a half, almost two years
trump, Think of it, but not really because I was able to give you those, I won't call them subsidies
trump, I made that mistake once with the farmers
trump, I said to this group of farmers that came in, Subsidy
trump, I used the word subsidy
trump, That was the worst word, Sir, we don't watch subsidy Please don't ever use that word
trump, I said, I won't, I promise
trump, Just in that small, little grouping where you were doing nothing
trump, It's called promises made, promises kept
trump, Promises met
trump, The last time I came, I never did this before, I never ran, so they all said, You never ran before
trump, You can't do this if you never ran, so whatever happened, it happened
trump, One by one, they started dropping out, right And then I was left with one, Hillary Clinton, and that worked out very nicely
trump, He cannot get to 270, remember 270, electoral college
trump, He cannot get to 270
trump, I went to Maine
trump, It's true, Maine, too
trump, It's got one point, right, one
trump, I went there a lot, many times
trump, Everyone said, well, they kept getting me, maybe if I have a great night, 269, but 269 loses
trump, Right But we got 306 to 223
trump, 306, 223, so they were right, You cannot get to 270, you can get to 306, but not that there is… In the eight years before my election, net farm income plummeted by 20, you know that
trump, If you look at a chart, for 15 years actually, not eight, for 15 years, it's like a roller coaster ride down for the farmer
trump, Soybeans
trump, Take a look at it all
trump, It was just a one way street
trump, Everybody was ripping off the American farmer
trump, Now you're going to see numbers that are going to be great
trump, Look at even what's happened recently
trump, It's incredible what's going on and I love it, because you deserve it
trump, You suffered a lot, with people that were stupid
trump, They were stupid Under three years of my administration, net farm income has already gone up nearly 50 and will now be rising even faster
trump, What are you going to do You are going to vote for Bernie You are going to vote for Bernie Here I am on the debate stage, Well, net income has gone up for the farmers 50
trump, Tell me, how the hell do I lose this debate How do I lose And based on the polls, I guess I'm not going to lose in this state
trump, I don't think I will lose in any other state either
trump, Because this is really true all over the country
trump, This is happening all over the country, not just Iowa
trump, On no issue have Washington Democrats more thoroughly betrayed the American people than on immigration
trump, Illegal immigration costs our nation hundreds of billions of dollars, drains public services, overcrowds our schools and hospitals, and threatens innocent American lives at a number that you wouldn't even believe
trump, But we have got it closed up, but we're getting your people in
trump, You have people that have worked for you for a long time, don't you I know who the people that you have, and they are hard workers
trump, We have a lot of great people
trump, You have a lot of great people out there
trump, Right here in Des Moines, a twice deported, illegal alien was charged with shooting and killing a woman, her 11-year-old daughter, and her five-year-old son
trump, In this region of the county alone, last year, ICE officers arrested nearly 4,000 illegal aliens charged or convicted of heinous crimes, including robbery, rape, and murder
trump, Yet today's Democrat Party glorifies illegal immigration
trump, We have no idea, now we do now, but people would come in by the hundreds of thousands
trump, We have no idea who they are
trump, Many are fine people and all of that, but some are stone cold rapists, and murderers, and people that their countries don't want, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and even Mexico
trump, Right now we have a love affair with Mexico because the Democrats, the Democrats wouldn't give us what we needed and I got Mexico, they're great
trump, They put up 27,000 soldiers on our Southern border and the numbers are plummeting, 87 down
trump, The president of Mexico is doing a great job
trump, And we ended Catch and Release
trump, You think that was easy Catch and Release, you know what Catch and Release is You catch a criminal, you take the number, and you release him into the, they would never come back
trump, We say, come back please in three years, this is a Democrat deal
trump, Come back if you don't mind, in three years
trump, We release them into our country
trump, We totally ended it through a very, very slick group of rules
trump, Catch and Release
trump, May we please have your address and your phone number Here it is What have you done I got out of jail
trump, Oh, well, welcome to the United States
trump, Please, we have a little information
trump, Okay, and now we're going to release you, and in three and a half years, we schedule a court appearance for you
trump, Do you believe, this is the only country in the world
trump, They catch somebody on the border
trump, You're supposed to be Perry Mason
trump, You take them to court
trump, Other countries catch somebody at the border
trump, They say,  Sorry, you got to get out
trump, We say, Oh, may we have your information We're taking you to court
trump, Man
trump, Today's Democrat Party glorifies illegal immigration, vilifies the heroes of law enforcement, and pledges to dissolve immigration control entirely
trump, They want open borders
trump, They want hundreds of thousands of people to flow into our country
trump, And some of those people, some of those people are stone cold killers
trump, Some of those people, in the caravans, right I came up with that name but they won't give me credit for that
trump, They don't give me credit for anything
trump, They don't give me credit for fake news
trump, Wasn't that my term Now they say, I see CNN, they said, Fake news has reported, no, no, you are fake news, that fake news is you
trump, You are fake news
trump, They turned the term around
trump, They are reporting that fake news is reporting their fake news
trump, Left wing politicians even support deadly sanctuary cities that release criminal aliens directly into American communities
trump, We don't want them
trump, In New York City, the Mayor's Sanctuary Policy recently forced the release of a- … the mayor's sanctuary policy recently forced the release of a criminal illegal alien charged with assault
trump, After being set free the same criminal raped, brutalized and murdered a 92 year old woman
trump, They wouldn't give him to the ICE warriors
trump, Their warriors
trump, They're tough and they love our country
trump, They're very tough and they love our country
trump, They're taking MS-13 gang members … They're about as tough as you get, they're taking them out of our country by the thousands
trump, By the thousands
trump, That's a tough job but they love to do it
trump, They love our country
trump, Sanctuary city policies aren't just wrong, they're immoral, and they're lethal, and they really are something that has to be stopped
trump, They have to be stopped now
trump, What's happening is a disgrace
trump, Thankfully here in Iowa your great Republican governor, sometimes referred to as Governor Reynolds, signed a state-wide ban on sanctuary cities
trump, Thank you Kim
trump, That is why we need to elect more Republicans nationwide, to end sanctuary cities in all 50 states
trump, Thank you Kim Reynolds
trump, You know I endorsed her, so I want to take full credit for the job she has done
trump, I endorsed her very early, right Very early I endorsed her
trump, I know talent
trump, She's done a great job
trump, Democrats stand for crime, corruption, and chaos
trump, Republicans stand for law, order, and justice
trump, It's true
trump, We are finding the illegal game members, drug dealers, predators, and we are throwing them the hell out of our country, ideally
trump, We don't want to put them in prison because you know what We got to pay for them for the next 50 years, but sometimes we have to
trump, If they're too dangerous we have no choice
trump, Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border we have reduced illegal border crossings seven straight months in a row, and they're getting lower, and lower
trump, Shockingly, as that wall gets longer, the crossings get less
trump, Remember the Democrats You don't need a wall
trump, You don't need a wall
trump, You don't need it
trump, Seven years they all voted for it, they just didn't have the ability to build it
trump, You know it's not easy with land, and this, and that, and property, and rights
trump, They couldn't figure it out but I can figure it out
trump, The problem was we couldn't get the money, but we got all the money we need now
trump, We have everything
trump, We have everything
trump, The last time, this last budget, they didn't really fight us on the wall
trump, You know why Because they learned it's a really bad issue for them
trump, It's a really bad issue
trump, But I made one mistake with the wall
trump, I should have said, We will never ever build a wall
trump, They would have given me so much money to build a wall
trump, That was my only … Because I used to go, We will build the wall, right That was a mistake
trump, I should have said, We will never ever build it
trump, Under no circumstances, and they would have forced its building and I would have said, Okay
trump, By the way, in all due respect, you know who's going to pay for the wall, right No, no, they play … The fake news plays
trump, No, no, through remittance illegal aliens from Mexico are going to pay for the call
trump, That's what it is
trump, Remittance
trump, 100 because when I say something I mean it
trump, I said I was going to build a wall
trump, You think it's easy when you have a party that controls the House, you got to end that
trump, You got to end that
trump, They said they picked up the House in '18 but I didn't run in '18
trump, You know the big difference when you run, '16 I ran, '18 I didn't run
trump, They did, they picked up some seats
trump, I didn't run, but I'm running this time and we've got to take back the House
trump, Kevin McCarthy will be a great Speaker of the House
trump, Kevin McCarthy will be a great Speaker, watch
trump, But getting something built when you have a party that controls one of the three, getting it built is … Honestly I don't want to brag, nobody else could have done it
trump, Nobody else could have done it
trump, It's The Real Deal wall
trump, It's the wall that border security wanted
trump, Remember I thought I could just build concrete slabs They didn't want that because you have to be able to see through
trump, I said, Oh come on
trump, This is the expensive version
trump, This is the best version
trump, This is steel, and concrete, and rebar in between
trump, It's really something
trump, Did you see the other day where drug dealers got caught at the top They couldn't get over
trump, We had to get the fire department to get them down
trump, They couldn't get over and they're like mountain climbers
trump, They got used to climbing
trump, They got caught because you know that panel That's an anti-climb panel
trump, It's very hot and very tough
trump, It's a very hard panel to climb, the panel on top
trump, Sometimes I'd say, I'd rather do without that panel, because I'm a very visual person
trump, They said, Sir that's anti-climb panel
trump, I said, Oh it is Okay, let's put it on
trump, To hell with it
trump, It's true
trump, Anti-climb panel
trump, The wall is the top of the line
trump, That's what they wanted
trump, Mostly 30 feet tall
trump, That's very tall
trump, That's maximum
trump, It's really doing a big trick
trump, A lot … Wherever we have it … 100 miles is all of a sudden a lot, but where you have that it's incredible
trump, 99
trump,9, especially when we're watching it
trump, We're watching the sections
trump, Illegal crossings now are down 75 since last spring
trump, The powerful border wall was starting to set
trump, I mean pretty soon we'll be setting records in speed
trump, It's going up very rapidly
trump, Very rapidly
trump, You're seeing it all over and it's going to be really something
trump, Look, it would be nice if we didn't have to have it
trump, It would be great, but we have to have it
trump, They said, Oh we could have drones
trump, Oh what are you going to do with drones flying around When people are going through your border with nowhere … They're going to have drones flying around
trump, They know because they were all for it
trump, They were all for it
trump, Now all of a sudden they're against, but they want drones
trump, Well we're going to have drones too but the drones are policing the wall
trump, In terms of human trafficking, people don't even talk about it
trump, Because of the internet, sadly, the worst in the history of our world
trump, All over the world
trump, Trafficking in women and children all over the world
trump, All over the world
trump, The worst it's ever been, but when we have this border it makes it very, very tough for them to come into the United States with women and with children stuffed in trunks in the back of a car
trump, The Washington Democrats have never been more extreme
trump, 132 congressional Democrats have signed up for Bernie Sanders' government healthcare takeover bill
trump, It's a takeover of your healthcare that would strip all of those 180,000 million great Americans of your private coverage
trump, You want that
trump, You got great deals
trump, You're able to negotiate, you're able to keep your doctor, keep your area, keep your hospitals, keep everything that you wanted
trump, Now they want to take it away
trump, Report to an operating room when you have a cold, okay In your local hospital
trump, I don't think so
trump, 180,000 million people, but I'm not going to knock it because I want Bernie to bring it right up to the end and we'll debate it the day before the election
trump, Okay We are saving your healthcare while Socialist Democrats are trying to take away your healthcare
trump, Sleepy Joe has no idea what he's even … He doesn't even know what he's talking about
trump, He's so lost
trump, Honestly, that poor guys is so lost
trump, They talk healthcare, she said, It's over for him
trump, It was over for him, actually if you knew him, a long time ago
trump, Now it's really over
trump, We are making healthcare better and cheaper
trump, We got rid of the individual mandate, the most unpopular thing, which essentially killed Obamacare
trump, We are protecting people with pre-existing conditions and we always will, the Republican party
trump, We're stopping surprise medical billing and making everything totally transparent
trump, I signed it already
trump, Everything now is going to transparencies, where hospitals, doctors, everybody has to tell you how much things are costing
trump, Watch those prices come down
trump, Right Right I have an expert on healthcare
trump, He said transparency because it's a big deal
trump, It's a big deal
trump, Nobody else would have gotten it done, that I can tell you
trump, Transparency is bigger than healthcare because you will see prices tumbling like you wouldn't believe
trump, People go in for a blood test, they get charged 2,700
trump, Down the road they get the same test for 57
trump, The same exact test
trump, Maybe it's better
trump, Maybe it's better
trump, It's crazy
trump, When you have transparency it's all going to come
trump, You watch
trump, You watch
trump, But this person, a real expert, said, This is bigger than healthcare, and I got it done
trump, Unfortunately it won't really start kicking in until after the election because it takes a period of time
trump, They have certain statutory requirements, et cetera
trump, Well you better let me win
trump, Can you imagine Can you imagine I did transparency, I took the guts, I did transparency and then I'm going to watch as somebody else says, Didn't he do a great job for transparency You better let me win because I want the credit for that one
trump, We're buying cheaper drugs from other countries and approving more generic drugs than ever, ever, ever before
trump, We are defending your right to keep the doctor
trump, We are defending your right to keep your plan
trump, Remember Obama 28 times, You can keep your doctor
trump, You can keep your doctor 28
trump, You can also keep your plan
trump, You can keep it
trump, You can keep it
trump, 28 times he lied
trump, We should impeach him
trump, No, he got it on a lie
trump, He got it on a lie, but we've run it much better
trump, But essentially it's totally different because of individual mandate
trump, Because that really took the guts out of it and we're running it much better
trump, I had a choice, do we run it well or do we run it poorly If we run it poorly everyone's going to blame me
trump, If we run it well everyone's going to give him credit, especially the fakers back there right But you know what We got to run it well but we're coming up with a healthcare that if we win the House we will have the best healthcare of any country in the world, by far
trump, We're fighting the lobbyists and we're fighting the special interest, in case you didn't notice
trump, We are serving only you
trump, Thanks to our bold reforms we're now offering health plans that are 60 cheaper than Obamacare
trump, We're offering a lot of different things
trump, We have just passed, recently, 10 months ago, Right to Try
trump, I love Right to Try
trump, You know what that is That's people are terminally ill and they can't use medicine because … They've been trying to pass this, almost for 50 years
trump, You can't use the medicine
trump, We have the greatest doctors, labs, hospitals in the world
trump, They come up with a medicine but it has to go through the FDA procedure, right You can't do anything
trump, You can't use it
trump, They won't let you use it
trump, Now I have you sign an agreement, you're not going to sue the United States, you're not going to this, your family, et cetera, et cetera
trump, Very simple
trump, And they can use it
trump, You have no idea the results that are taking place
trump, You have no idea
trump, You have no idea the results
trump, People's lives are being … For me it was simple
trump, I said, Wait a minute, you're worried about hurting somebody These people are dying
trump, They're terminally ill
trump, They're admitting they're terminally ill and you won't let them use a drug that may work Let the use the drug
trump, And we're letting them use the drug and it's working in a lot of cases
trump, We have transformed veterans healthcare, including VA Choice
trump, The best
trump, You know I think I'm a totally brilliant human being
trump, I think I'm the smartest person, so I came up with a plan
trump, I'll never forget, I was in New Hampshire, I came up with this idea because everybody kept coming up to me and saying, Sir it's really terrible what's happening with healthcare
trump, We're waiting in line for two weeks, for four weeks, for seven weeks
trump, Honestly people were waiting in line, they weren't very sick, they were terminally ill, truthfully, before they saw a doctor
trump, By the time they got to the doctor
trump, So I came up with this incredible plan
trump, Only I could think of this
trump, I said, Here's what you do … Here's what you do, if somebody can't get a doctor quickly, because we have great doctors at the VA
trump, They don't get enough credit
trump, If you can't get to a doctor quickly you go outside, you go locally, you get a doctor, we pay the bill, you get yourself all better
trump, Right So I went back
trump, I went back and I told my people, Do you have any idea how smart I am Listen to this plan I have
trump, They said, Actually sir we've known about that plan for 52 years we just couldn't get it approved
trump, So I said, Oh that's too bad, I thought it was brilliant, but what I am good at is getting things approved and I got it approved
trump, People are using it and it's great
trump, I know the people of Iowa don't care about this but we are making substantial investments in rural healthcare
trump, We are combating the opioid epidemic
trump, Drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 31 years
trump, That's a great thing
trump, Our great first lady is helping us with that
trump, That is such a big thing for Melania
trump, Big, big thing
trump, She is really involved
trump, We will never let the Democrats give away your healthcare to illegal immigrants, especially when we say, Come in
trump, Come in, we'll give you healthcare
trump, It's one thing they come in and it's a rough situation because we all have hearts but when people are saying, like in California this wacky governor he says, Come in, we're going to give you healthcare
trump, We're going to give you free education
trump, We're going to give you everything
trump, We're going to give you a beautiful Rolls-Royce
trump, See to show you how fake they are one of the newscasters said, Donald Trump said that the governor of California promised a Rolls-Royce to illegal immigrants
trump, He didn't promise them
trump, This was a lie and a misrepresentation by President Trump
trump, They can't take a little humor
trump, They can't take it
trump, These people are sick
trump, They're sick
trump, No
trump, They're sick people
trump, Them and Shifty Schiff is a very sick person
trump, He lies awake at night shifting and turning, Shifty
trump, Shifting and turning in his bed, sweating like a dog
trump, How am I going to get him He didn't do anything wrong, how am I going to get him Oh what a sick guy he is
trump, Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late-term abortion
trump, Ripping babies straight from the mother's womb
trump, Right up until the moment of birth
trump, That is why I have asked Congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God
trump, Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, Socialism, and blatant corruption
trump, No matter how you cut it, that's what it is
trump, The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and the late great Abraham Lincoln
trump, You know that, right Abraham Lincoln
trump, Honest Abe
trump, Remember I always said, I can be more presidential than any other past president, other than perhaps Abraham Lincoln when he's wearing the hat, right Because it's easy to be presidential but only have about three people in front of me
trump, Be a, Good evening ladies and gentlemen
trump, Is everything okay in Iowa Oh I see, the world is ripping you off
trump, Well there's not a thing I can do about that
trump, Thank you
trump, Good night everybody
trump, Good night
trump, No, we got to do it the right way
trump, Republicans … And by the way, can I be honest Doing this takes far more talent than doing that
trump, Doing that is very easy
trump, This is not easy
trump, Especially when you just left Michigan, and you just left other places, and you got maniacs doing a number on you all the time for three years
trump, You got the maniacs for three years
trump, I think before I came down the escalator with our future first lady I think really they were doing it then
trump, They started even before I came down on the escalator
trump, These people are maniacs, so you have all that
trump, So you're fighting that and you're doing farm bills
trump, We got your farm bill approved by the way
trump, We got your farm bill approved
trump, I don't even mention that because that's massive by any other standard, but it's peanuts compared to the USMCA and the China deal, right So I don't even mention it
trump, Anyway, Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background and from every race, religion, color, and creed
trump, It's true
trump, Our numbers with African American workers, people, are through the roof
trump, Are through the roof because … Remember I used to say, What do you have to lose I'd read the down the worst on crime, the worst on education
trump, They got this, they got that, they got 10 different things, all horrible

trump, I said, Stay with me
trump, What the hell do you have to lose You know what You know what Remember that Now they have the best employment and unemployment numbers, they have the best poverty numbers, they have numbers that nobody would believe
trump, They're doing so great
trump, It's so great to see it
trump, It's incredible
trump, Youth unemployment, African American youth
trump, It's been great
trump, We're asking all Americans to join our incredible movement
trump, We are a big tent and a big party with big, bold, beautiful ideas for the future
trump, We're what the country was based on originally
trump, It was called greatness
trump, It was called greatness
trump, During National School Choice Week, School Choice everybody, we continue our fight to rescue children trapped in failing government schools
trump, Iowa became one of the first states to pass School Choice
trump, That was over 10 years ago
trump, Now Governor Reynolds, Senator Ernst, Senator Grassley, and more than 100 members of Congress are supporting our plan to give School Choice to every child in America who needs it
trump, It's a great plan
trump, To give former prisoners a second chance at life we passed criminal justice reform
trump, Think of that
trump, Think of that
trump, We had a lot of great Conservatives who wanted it, we had Liberals who wanted it
trump, They couldn't get it passed
trump, President Obama couldn't even come close
trump, He didn't try too hard
trump, He talked like, Oh I'll try
trump, To uphold the rule of law we have confirmed 191 federal judges, a record, who will interpret The Constitution as one
trump, And two great Supreme Court justices, by the way
trump, As part as … Right Two great ones
trump, As part of my commitment to rebuild our military we secured an 8

trump, I recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem
trump, We recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights
trump, Yesterday we just released a historic new plan for peace
trump, We're going to see if we can get that done
trump, It's one of the toughest deals of all
trump, One of the toughest deals but we have a shot at it
trump, For years you watched as your politicians apologized for our country
trump, They apologized
trump, They would say, I'm sorry
trump, Now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the great people of Iowa
trump, We are standing up for Iowa
trump, At stake in our present battle is the survival, frankly, of our nation
trump, Look, I can make this speech really short
trump, All I have to do is say, Hello Iowa, you have no choice
trump, You have to vote for me
trump, Otherwise everything that you've built in your entire life will be gone
trump, Goodbye Iowa, have a good time
trump, Instead I work my ass off up here, okay Yeah
trump, True
trump, Do you think this is easy It's a little hot in this room
trump, This room wasn't designed for this many people
trump, If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for then we must devote everything we have toward victory in November of 2020
trump, We have to
trump, By the way, for those beautiful farmers that want to leave your small farms or businesses to your children … Because of our great tax bill, the biggest tax cut in the history of our country, the biggest that you benefit by
trump, Because of that there is no death tax or inheritance tax, as they call it
trump, So I always say, If you love your children that's a great thing
trump, If you don't love your children don't leave it to them and that particular tax won't matter, but if you love … Is there anybody here that does not love your children Is there anybody here who loves your children Well it's Iowa
trump, It's Iowa
trump, You love your children
trump, You know you have no tax to pay, you leave your 
trump,
trump,
trump, No, it's great
trump, So when you're looking down at your children you're saying, Oh did you get lucky Did you get lucky Look at them, they're enjoying life
trump, But only this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp once and for all
trump, That swamp is bad
trump, That swamp is bad
trump, I had no idea it was going to be this sick and this degenerated
trump, It's a degenerate swamp
trump, I had no idea
trump, When I came out, I said, We're going to drain this swamp
trump, I had no idea that the swamp was that evil, but we're winning
trump, We're winning because we're in The White House
trump, We're winning
trump, With your help we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependents to independents, and poverty to prosperity
trump, That's what's happening all over our country
trump, Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration
trump, It's already happening
trump, We will continue to enact new trade deals that result in more products made, raised, farmed, and grown right here in the USA
trump, We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine
trump, Finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America in less than 10 years
trump, We've already started
trump, Should have been started in the last administration
trump, Incredible
trump, Should have been started earlier, but we started
trump, In less than 10 years, the AIDS epidemic will be eradicated, will be gone
trump, Who would have thought that was possible When they came in and told me that a couple of years ago, I said, Really Nobody knows that
trump, Incredible the strides that we've made
trump, We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms
trump, In the state of Virginia they want to take your guns away, you believe it Virginia, I love Virginia

trump, Well, from Cambridge to Council Bluffs, from Cedar Rapids where I made my last speech prior to the election
trump, What a place, 32,000 people
trump, I said, I'm going to win tomorrow
trump, To Rock Rapids, from Melbourne to Moorhead, and from Davenport to right here in Des Moines, Iowa
trump, We stand on the shoulders of true red blooded American heroes
trump, This great state was founded by tough, tough, tough frontier men
trump, These are tough people
trump, Let's see how big and how tough
trump, They're tough
trump, Anybody like to join ICE You want to join ICE He says, No thank you
trump, And strong pioneer women who defied the dangers to carve out a life and a beautiful home with great families and great neighbors

trump, Thank you, Iowa
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you
trump,
trump,What a crowd, what a crowd
trump, Get those people over here
trump, See me
trump, Let them come over
trump, What is a big crowd, it's always big
trump, We want to win
trump, We got to win
trump, We want to save our country from the radical left, the radical left crazies
trump, Thank you very much
trump, And hello, North Carolina, hello, North Carolina
trump, We love you, North Carolina
trump, I'm thrilled to be in Fayetteville with thousands of loyal, hard working American patriots
trump, And you know what's going to happen in 45 days from now, and you're watching those polls
trump, They go up, up, up up
trump, 45 days from now, we're going to win North Carolina
trump, We're going to win four more years in the White House
trump, As we meet tonight, our nation mourns the loss of a legal giant Supreme Court Justice, Ruth Bader Ginsburg
trump, Her landmark rulings, fierce devotion to justice and her courageous battle against cancer inspire all Americans
trump, You may agree
trump, You may not disagree with her, but she was an inspiration to a tremendous number of people
trump, I say, all Americans Justice Ginsburg's close relationship with a friend of ours, a friend of mine, Justice Scalia, is also a powerful reminder that we can disagree on fundamental issues while treating each other with decency, dignity, and respect
trump, Our thoughts and prayers are with her family
trump, Thank you very much
trump, So Article II of our constitution says the president shall nominate justices of the Supreme Court
trump, I don't think it can be any more clear, can it I don't think so
trump, I don't think so
trump, What do you think, Thom Thom Tillis, I don't think it can be any more clear
trump, This can only happen in North Carolina
trump, I hope you hear that back home
trump, Look at all that press
trump, That's a lot of press
trump, That's a lot of fake news
trump, Well, I hope they hear
trump, So the chant, this is a new one
trump, Fill that seat
trump, This is the chant
trump, This can only happen to me
trump, Fill that seat
trump, Now it says the president is supposed to fill the seat, right And that's what we're going to do
trump, We're going to fill the seat
trump, With a great hat
trump, I want to try one of those hats
trump, I love that
trump, No, think of it
trump, 29 times, every single time nobody said, Oh, let's not fill the seat
trump, We won the election
trump, Now then we have some senators that, forget it
trump, Think of it, I won't say it
trump, I won't say it, Susan
trump, I won't say it, Susan
trump, But Thom Tillis is with us
trump, I can tell you that
trump, Great
trump, We have great Republican senators
trump, We have great people and we have a great country
trump, That's really, we have a great country
trump, And we're going to keep it that way
trump, So we win an election and those are the consequences
trump, It's called fill that seat and that's what we're doing
trump, The Supreme Court was a very central issue in both the 2016 presidential election and then the 2018 midterm elections where, by the way, I didn't run
trump, We had a lot of people, a lot of people said, Oh, he really took a little bit of a shellacking
trump, Not nearly as bad as others
trump, In fact, we gained seats in the Senate, but they never talk about that
trump, They don't talk about that
trump, We gained two seats
trump, Nobody talked about it
trump, But we didn't run
trump, And I had a lot of people that, Sir, we'll never vote in 2018
trump, I said, No, no vote, everybody vote
trump, They just didn't
trump, I think we were like 9 million people decided they wanted to wait and they've waited and you see what's going on
trump, You see what's happening
trump, You see the enthusiasm that we have
trump, Which, by the way, we set a record in 2016
trump, The bad news for the Democrats is we are more enthusiastic now
trump, Not even close, than we were in 2016
trump, We are getting crowds and this is pandemic and we're rounding the turn
trump, We're rounding the corner of the pandemic
trump, But we're having them outside
trump, And we shouldn't say this is some kind of a rally from now on
trump, It's called a protest
trump, We are protesters
trump, We're going to call on our rallies that because you see a lot of these, let's call them blue states, we want to be nice
trump, We're going to call it a protest against stupidity
trump, So we are going to have protests against stupidity
trump, And Pennsylvania
trump, Look what they're doing in Pennsylvania
trump, A great state, that's actually something very special is going to happen here, in Pennsylvania
trump, That's a commonwealth
trump, We always have to remember Pennsylvania, commonwealth
trump, Got two of them and you better remember you get in trouble
trump, But we love Pennsylvania
trump, And it's a shut down
trump, The governor's got it just shut down nice and tight
trump, And you know what On November 4th, it's going to be opened up
trump, Because they're trying to hurt our numbers
trump, But our economic numbers are so good
trump, They're staggering
trump, They're the best we've ever had
trump, Jobs, retail, stock, market, everything
trump, And this is with a lot of shutdowns by Democrats
trump, That's all they're doing
trump, On November 4th, they'll announce, We've decided to open up
trump, One of the teachers groups said, actually, one of the unions and one of the politicians in California said, No, we're not going to do it
trump, We need to do it
trump, We should be open by November 4th
trump, That was not a good thing for them to say
trump, That person I think was fired, I think was fired
trump, In both the 2016 and the 2018 elections, the American people chose a president and a Senate majority united in their commitment to selecting nominees who believe in applying the Constitution as written
trump, Both the White House and the Senate majority have a moral duty to fulfill the promises they made to the voters
trump, And that is exactly what we're going to do
trump, We said that if for any reason, we have a vacancy on the United States Supreme Court, we will fill that vacancy
trump, We're not going to say, and by the way, we have plenty of time
trump, There's a lot of time
trump, You're talking about January 20th
trump, So we will uphold equal justice under the law for citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed
trump, I won't be putting forth a nominee next week
trump, It will be a woman
trump, It will be a woman unless, wait, okay, let's do a poll
trump, Oh, there they are
trump, How many of these have you come to Speaking of women, how many of, what is this number one Like 90, they're great
trump, North Carolina, though
trump, I see them all over the place, they're great
trump, Anyway, I hope your husbands are okay with it
trump, Are they okay They're okay
trump, You have good husbands
trump, But we're going to do a vote
trump, So I said, I love these free polls because pollsters and most of the pollsters are corrupt as far as I'm concerned
trump, If we believed in pollsters we wouldn't be here right now
trump, But we're actually getting very good
trump, We just had a 53 from Rasmussen, which is very good
trump, Considering we won four years ago with a lot lower than 53
trump, History has shown that when you're at 53 you can't lose an election
trump, Has anyone ever lost an election with a 53 The answer is yes, when the other side cheats
trump, That could happen, that could happen
trump, That could happen
trump, You saw what happened in Pennsylvania
trump, Some state supreme court justice just ruled that they can take as long as they want to count the ballots
trump, That means I'll be leading and winning Pennsylvania like we did last time
trump, Yeah, yeah
trump, We'll be leading, we'll be winning Pennsylvania
trump, We're going to win it easy
trump, We're going to win your state easily
trump, And Deb, what a great, she's doing such a good job
trump, But Mark, just a few months ago, I've been trying to get him for three years to leave and we have a great person running as you know
trump, Really, I mean really great
trump, Does everyone know Madison Yes You're going to vote for Madison He's great
trump, He's a great guy
trump, But Mark had a beautiful head of black hair and I just noticed that hair's turning white very fast
trump, But we're doing a job
trump, We're very close to a great deal with TikTok, TikTok but nobody cares about that anymore
trump, All they care about is fill that seat, right Until about 24 hours ago, that's all they talked about is TikTok, TikTok
trump, We have a deal worked out, I think with Walmart is going to buy it along with Oracle
trump, Larry Ellison, it's going to be an incredible combination
trump, And I said, Do me a favor
trump, Could you put up 5 billion into a fund for education so we can educate people as to real history of our country, the real history, not the fake history
trump, Because we're getting very close to that deal
trump, And all of the technology will be maintained here
trump, They're going to move probably to the great state of Texas
trump, Sorry, we got you a lot of business when it came… but they're going to move into the United States, which is what's important
trump, They're moving to the United States, unbelievable company
trump, They're going to have 25,000 jobs
trump, If it all goes, I gave them the preliminary approval
trump, But they're putting up 5 billion
trump, And my only problem is they did it so fast
trump, I should have asked for more
trump, What happened is when I suggested they should put up a lot of money everybody said, senators, congressmen, women, everybody
trump, They said, You can't do that
trump, That's never been done
trump, That's the problem, nothing's ever been done
trump, And we had other companies, a lot of people wanted it
trump, And I said, You got to put up 5 million either to the Treasury of the United States maybe or into some education fund or do something
trump, And they were sort of agreeing with me
trump, They thought it was okay
trump, And then I went to the legal legals here and I said, They're going to put up 5 million, give it to the United States
trump, Sir
trump,,You can't do that
trump, There's no provision
trump, I said, How the hell can there be no provision
trump, We're making the deal possible
trump, Why can't they give us 5 billion dollars That's b, that's a lot of money
trump, Now, watch the crazy Democrats
trump, They'll go, They should have gotten more money
trump, It's never been done before
trump, They should have, no matter what you do
trump, They should have gotten more
trump, Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, crazy Nancy
trump, But I'll tell you
trump, And I said it last night, we had a great rally
trump, Last night, you saw that in a place that we're going to win
trump, We're going to win Minnesota
trump, Hasn't been won since 1972
trump, And they're all saying, Well, we did give them back the big iron ore range
trump, It was, Obama took it away with the stroke of a pen
trump, He put everybody out of work
trump, We gave it back
trump, But I'll tell you what, we're going to have a victory on November 3rd, the likes of which you've never seen
trump, Now we're counting on the federal court system to make it so that we can actually have an evening where we know who wins
trump, Not where the votes are going to be counted a week later or two weeks later
trump, But in just three and a half years under my administration, we've secured America's borders rebuilt the awesome power of the U
trump,S military, think of that
trump, And I shouldn't say this and the fake news keeps going, Oh, he's given away classified information
trump, No I'm not
trump, We are building and we have built weapons the likes of which this world has never seen before
trump, And I said that a week ago and it was a headline and one of these fake newspapers where, He's giving away confidential information, these people are crazy
trump, No, no
trump, I'm just telling you that- Crazy
trump, No, no
trump, I'm just telling you that President Putin and President Xi of China, Russia, China, North Korea, everybody
trump, They are so envious of what we're doing
trump, They can't even believe it
trump, If they know, they perhaps don't know
trump, Under Obama, they knew immediately, okay
trump, Under us, but we are building weapons, all made in the USA
trump, The likes of which no country has ever seen before
trump, And hope to God, we never have to use them
trump, That's the key, I don't ever want to use them
trump, Remember, I was supposed to be a guy that was going to get us into a war in the first week
trump, Remember that Where's the war We're taking them out of Afghanistan
trump, We're almost finished with that
trump, Working along well
trump, We're taking them out of Syria, other than I left some behind for the oil, we kept the oil, is it okay that we kept the oil Is it okay we kept the oil Let's go back to my poll
trump, Ready So we're putting, I think it should be a woman, because I actually like women much more than I like men, I have to say
trump, No, I do
trump, I do, I like women more
trump, So I have to make a decision, to fill the seat, as we say, we should have a new campaign
trump, Let's make a t-shirt, fill the seat
trump, Okay My people are so good, tomorrow, it'll be all over the place
trump, That's a good idea
trump, That's a good idea
trump, Fill the seat
trump, Okay watch this, so good tomorrow you'll see them all over the place, fill the seat
trump, I don't know how the hell they do it, but they get it done fast
trump, You remember I said, where's Hunter Where's Hunter The next day, it was like one of the biggest selling t- shirts where is Hunter What the hell ever happened He took the money and he ran I think
trump, Where's Hunter He took the money, he went to China, he took 1
trump,5 billion
trump, He had no experience
trump, He didn't have a job until this guy became vice president
trump, Then he went to China, he got 1
trump,5 billion
trump, I asked the head of a great company, Blackstone
trump, One of the biggest in the world
trump, I said, Steve, let me ask you a question
trump, Is that possible No, that's never done
trump, China doesn't do that
trump, Well, how did a guy with no experience do this He said, Very simple
trump, His father's vice president
trump, Is that what you want And then Ukraine, 183,000 a month, and a 3 million upfront payment for him and his friends, think of this, with no experience and no job, and they said, do you know energy It's an energy company that paid it
trump, Do you know energy No, I don't
trump, I've not familiar with the subject
trump, Our great Congressman
trump, Right How the hell does this happen I think it will be brought up into debate
trump, I think it will be brought up in the debate, I think
trump, Where is Hunter Where is Hunter You know where Hunter is He's probably on the Riviera having a very good time
trump, He's giving some great energy advice
trump, He's learning
trump, He's taking a night class on energy for 180 grand
trump, Where is Hunter They're corrupt
trump, Remember Joe with a prosecutor  1 billion, I'm not giving it to them until they get those prosecutors away from my son or whatever the hell he said, that crazy company over in Ukraine
trump, 1 billion
trump, I'm not giving it
trump, You get them out
trump, And guess what They got them out
trump, Here's your billion dollars
trump, Now that's called quid pro quo
trump, Right That's the real deal
trump, With us, there was none
trump, They made it up
trump, Remember when Shift made the phony speech Eight times he said the same thing, except that's not what happened
trump, Fortunately, we had those wonderful people that write every perfect word, every word
trump, I'm glad we had them because we're dealing with a bunch of thieving bad people
trump, So women and men, ready Would you rather have a woman on the Supreme Court or would you rather have a man Ready A woman or a man
trump, So, would you rather have me choose, this is a very scientific poll
trump, Actually, it's a lot more accurate than these polls that interview like 97 people have been interviewed, then they charge you a million dollars and they probably don't interview the people
trump, They sit behind their desk
trump, Would you rather have a woman on the Supreme Court Yes, woman
trump, Yes Tom tiller says yes
trump, Or would you rather have a man on the Supreme Court What's going on Let's give it one more quick chance
trump, This is a free poll
trump, And this is a lot of people
trump, This is tens of thousands of people
trump, This is a lot of people
trump, You know, the fake news, they'll say, He had a smattering of people
trump, If Bernie Sanders had a crowd
trump, Oh, he had a massive crowd
trump, It was so big
trump, With me, my crowds are five times bigger than Bernie's
trump, And they'll say, He had a smattering of people
trump, They were in the middle of an airport that nobody ever heard of
trump, Thousands
trump, If those people, come on, bring them over
trump, What the hell, at this point, might as well, let them come on over
trump, Come on over
trump, You got thousands of people behind these people
trump, I would imagine the sight lines aren't too good
trump, You have stands in front
trump, Okay
trump, So one more time
trump, Who would rather have a man on the Supreme Court Who would have a woman on the Supreme
trump, Now tomorrow, like fake news, CNN, he was playing games with the United States
trump, It is a terrible thing he's done
trump, No, I'm just taking a poll, please
trump, And by the way, that's a very accurate poll, because that's the way I feel
trump, It will be a woman, a very talented, very brilliant woman
trump, Who I haven't chosen yet, but we have numerous women on the list
trump, I built this incredible list of brilliant people
trump, And we're asking for Biden's list
trump, He can't give it
trump, You know why Because if he ever gave a list, he'd either put somebody in the left middle, which would be okay
trump, You could get votes, or he'd put one, somebody, which is what he's going to choose, so far left, now, if he did the left middle, he loses his entire left coast
trump, Right And if he loses the left coast, that's the end of his election
trump, And last time, remember how many people I got from Bernie, because of trade
trump, A lot of the Bernie people vote for us because Bernie is right about one thing, trade
trump, But Bernie took a bad defeat, didn't he It was a bad loss
trump, He's one of the most gracious losers I've ever seen, he is
trump, All Elizabeth Warren, Pocahontas had to do is leave
trump, If she left before Super Tuesday, Bernie would have won every one of those States, but they split up that vote
trump, That's too bad, but we have Sleepy Joe, we'll see how that works out
trump, I think it's working out pretty good
trump, We were winning so much, we didn't even have, we could have called off the election
trump, We were winning by so much, and then the plane came in from China
trump, And in many ways, I had to go back to work, but I had to go back to work on this one too
trump, And now we're going up and up and up and we're winning and we're winning all over the place
trump, Because I happen to think, I just say what I want
trump, And you know, they make up a lot of false stories
trump, They will make up a lie
trump, Like what I said about military
trump, Can you imagine No animal would say that
trump, They make it up and then they put it in ads
trump, So once they did that, the only good thing is I can say, I said, Now I can say anything
trump, He is the worst candidate, the dumbest of all candidates, but he was dumb in prime time, as told to me by a Senator from long ago, he said, Who's the dumbest in the Senate, who's the smartest in the Senate The smartest is, I won't tell you
trump, But the dumbest is Joe
trump, I said, Who's Joe
trump, He said, Joe Biden
trump, That was 25 years ago
trump, That was in prime time
trump, He is the worst candidate in the history of presidential politics
trump, If I lose to him, I don't know what I'm going to do
trump, I will never speak to you again
trump, You'll never see me again
trump, No, how do you lose He is honestly, I go up and these guys are grilling me all the time
trump, Stephanopoulos grill, grill
trump, Okay
trump, It's all right
trump, It's okay
trump, I think it came out very, well it's always, it comes out well
trump, You have to be able to answer
trump, They're very weak compared to some of the foreign people that we deal with from foreign countries, leaders of foreign countries
trump, But I say he's always using a teleprompter
trump, I don't care if he uses a teleprompter, you know what bothers me That means the fake news is giving him the questions
trump, So that's what really… they never gave me the questions
trump, If I ever said, in fact, I'm going to say it now
trump, I want from now on you to give me the questions before you ask me
trump, And I'm going to read the questions off the teleprompter, and the questions are so easy
trump, Did you see Anderson Cooper He's a nice guy
trump, He's interviewed me over the years, a lot, but he's a tough interviewer
trump, Did you see those softballs What do you think Donald Trump is a very bad human being
trump, Do you agree with that Yes, I do, Anderson
trump, I've never seen softballs, and actually they're getting hit by it
trump, They're getting hit by it
trump, It's just a terrible thing
trump, I mean, this is a guy, I used to call him 1 Joe, because he ran numerous times and he could only get 1
trump, In fact, he actually had 1 with an arrow pointing left
trump, That means less than one
trump, Now he's shot, he's got half of his head left, and he's out, think of it
trump, He's totally shot
trump, And he ends up getting the nomination
trump, He couldn't get it in prime time
trump, What the hell is going on with the world today What's going on What's going on with the world, Mark Meadows Unbelievable Meadows, oh boy
trump, He's a smart guy, Meadows, great, great guy, North Carolina, in just three and a half years, we obliterated the ISIS caliphate
trump, Remember when I had it down to 99, they said, You got to finish it
trump, I said, Let somebody else finish it
trump, And we went, and we finished it
trump, We fixed our disastrous trade deals, which we have
trump, China's now paying us billions and billions of dollars
trump, But you know, I view it differently now, I view China much differently now, after the plague came in, I view it differently
trump, And we brought your jobs back home to North Carolina and our contract
trump, In three years of President Trump, real median household income rose by almost 7,000
trump, Now think of that, three years, three years, right Achieving the highest median income in the history of our country
trump, This is in three years
trump, Under 16 years of presidents, Barack Hussein Obama, ladies and gentlemen, is President Barack Hussein Obama, or as Rush Limbaugh, the great, how great is Rush Do we love Rush As Rush Limbaugh would say, Barack Hussein Obama
trump, You ever hear Rush Barack Hussein Obama
trump, Rush is great
trump, He's doing well too
trump, He's great
trump, He's a tough guy
trump, We love Rush
trump, We love you Rush
trump, He watches every one of these rallies
trump, You know, he supported me when I came down with our great first lady, I came down the escalator
trump, I made a speech
trump, I didn't even have a speech writer, I had to wing it
trump, The winging speeches are the best ones like last night
trump, But Rush said, I like that guy
trump, I'd never heard that before
trump, I'd never heard we're going to build a wall
trump, We're going to have secure borders
trump, We're going to make new trade deals that are like sane
trump, We're going to do all the things we're going to rebuild our military
trump, We're going to have a strong country again
trump, We did so many things, and Rush heard this
trump, I didn't know Rush
trump, I mean, maybe I met him once, twice, for two seconds
trump, And he became an instant fan of Trump
trump, And he was for a long time before I even got to know him
trump, And he's been so important, he's the King, 39 million listeners
trump, There's nobody like him
trump, Try sitting down for what is it Three hours And talking, just talking with everyone
trump, 39 million people, often
trump, Try sitting
trump, We love Rush
trump, I love Rush
trump, But listen, try sitting down with a radio show with millions and millions of people listening, and talk for three hours without phone calls
trump, Phone calls are easy
trump, Hey, what do you think of this What do you think
trump, Just talk
trump, Talk
trump, And everybody finds it fascinating
trump, And it is fascinating
trump, I wish I had time to listen more often
trump, It's a little tough as president, but everybody finds it fascinating
trump, And we gave Rush, because he's such an important person and done such an incredible job the Presidential Medal of Freedom
trump, And Catherine, his wife is great
trump, What a couple
trump, But Rush has been unbelievable
trump, He's so on our side
trump, And he was from literally day one, right from the beginning
trump, And we don't have to mention Sean, and Laura, and so many others
trump, We don't have to mention Lou, the great Lou Dobbs, right I mean, Lou Dobbs said, Lou started years ago, and he liked us from the beginning
trump, He said, Donald Trump is going to be a very good president
trump, Okay
trump, That was the first little time
trump, Then he went, Donald Trump
trump, I love Donald Trump, but he's the best since Ronald Reagan
trump, Then he went, Donald Trump is an even better president than Ronald Reagan
trump, So that was about a year and a half into it
trump, Then the great Lou Dobbs said, Donald Trump may be the greatest of all time
trump, Greatest of all time
trump, And then somebody said, Can I ask you Lou, when you say the greatest, does that include Abraham Lincoln and George Washington He said, Absolutely
trump, He's now the greatest of all time
trump, So we love Lou Dobbs
trump, Lou Dobbs is great
trump, Go out and buy his book
trump, His book is great
trump, But we have great support
trump, We have great support
trump, Tucker's been very good lately, I have to tell you
trump, Tucker has been very good
trump, Tucker Carlson, he's come a long way, actually the whole thing with faking around with our whole history
trump, He's very strong in that, we took care of that very powerfully, very powerfully
trump, We signed an executive order
trump, We fired a lot of people that were talking about cancel culture and a lot of fake stuff, that were getting paid a lot of money that we're here for a long time
trump, Under 16 years of presidents Obama and Bush, the median income only rose 2,900
trump, Now think of that
trump, So three years, it went up 7,000, 16 years, it went up less than 3,000
trump, I'd say that's a big difference
trump, And that's not including energy, because look what you're paying for your gasoline now
trump, Right Remember those days Remember those days of 5, you said, Let's get rid of that big truck
trump, Now you're all buying bigger trucks than they ever thought possible
trump, You know why Because gasoline is so damn cheap, right Remember the 5 days Now you're below 2 a lot, right Below two
trump, I mean, they're seeing numbers that nobody believes
trump, It's all good stuff
trump, And we're energy independent
trump, So many things have happened
trump, If you add four or 5,000, so you're talking about by 11,000, you got to add the energy
trump, I said to my people, Put the energy in
trump, Well, I don't know if it's right
trump, I said, Do me a favor, just put it in
trump, In my first three years, we lifted 6
trump,6 million people out of poverty, the largest poverty reduction of any president in American history
trump, We built the greatest economy in the history of the world
trump, And now we're doing it again, and we're doing it very rapidly
trump, This is a super V
trump, They said, Oh, I don't know, V is going to be very hard
trump, No, this is a super V
trump, We will deliver a safe and effective vaccine this year
trump, It's already in very good shape
trump, Very, very good shape
trump, In a matter of weeks
trump, We will end the pandemic from China
trump, We will end our plague from China
trump, Next year will be one of the greatest years in the history of our country, it's heading that way
trump, If you take a look, automobile manufacturing, housing, retailing, they're all setting records, they're through the roof, hard to believe, actually, during the rounding the corner, when I say rounding the corner, they go crazy
trump, They want to keep it going as long as possible
trump, If you say anything positive, they say, He's not telling the truth to the American public
trump, I am actually telling the truth
trump, You know these people, they talked about, because I said, Well, Winston Churchill was a great leader
trump, They said the other night, You said Winston Churchill was a great leader, but he didn't lie
trump, Because this guy, Woodward
trump, He writes a book
trump, He's had it
trump, He's another one shot
trump, I compare him sort of to Biden
trump, He's sharper than Biden, I have to say that, but he's shot
trump, He's tired
trump, He's exhausted
trump, I never saw a guy be able to do so much television, try doing a book on somebody else
trump, See how much television time they give you, like none
trump, But they said the other night, and it was amazing
trump, Winston Churchill
trump, They said, He didn't lie to the people, to Britain
trump, He didn't lie
trump, I said, Well, let me ask you this
trump, He stood on buildings when the Nazis, Hitler, were bombing London
trump, That's pretty brave, because he may have been doing a little drinking, but he was known for that, right He's got a right to, but it's true
trump, He stood in the buildings in London, as they were bombing London, and made speeches, and made statements, and had everything
trump, And he'd sometimes have press conferences
trump, And the fake news wouldn't show up
trump, He was standing there, nobody was in front of him
trump, But he would stand there, and he would say, You are safe
trump, You are safe
trump, Everything is okay
trump, You are safe
trump, Well, that's a lie, I guess, right So I said, Oh, I never thought of it that way
trump, I guess he lied
trump, No, he's a great leader, and he was leading, and he was a great, great prime minister
trump, He did a fantastic job
trump, Not lying
trump, No
trump, We love our country, we want to lead our country, and we can't let a thing like this, this is a horrible, horrible thing that happened to the world it happened, should have been stopped in China
trump, They stopped it from going into the rest of China, should have been stopped in China
trump, To defeat the China virus, we launched the largest industrial mobilization since World War II
trump, Somebody said, What grade would you give yourself I said, A+
trump, But I would give myself a D, I would say I would give myself, and my whole group, because Mike Pence is great, Mike Pence really was
trump, He worked so hard
trump, And it's unfair, he worked so hard
trump, The ventilators, the vaccines, the therapeutics now we have, look at what's happening
trump, When somebody gets very sick, look how we bring them back so often, compared to what it was originally
trump, I mean, the work that's been done, and wait until you see what happens over the next few weeks with what's going on
trump, But the Democrats don't want the vaccine
trump, They don't want it
trump, At first, they wanted a vaccine, because they didn't think it could happen
trump, Now that we have it, they're going like, Well, we don't want it
trump, It's the craziest thing
trump, Think of it, you want to get a vaccine, and they're willing to hurt people, let people die for political reasons
trump, Think of it
trump, I think, honestly, I think it's a disgrace
trump, But we surged rapid testing kits
trump, We have more testing than all other, I mean, practically everybody
trump, You look at number two is India
trump, They have 1
trump,5 billion people
trump, We are up 50 million tests more than India
trump, In fact, we're about to crack 100 million tests
trump, And when you test, then you have, does this make sense Then you have cases
trump, So we do all this testing, and I come home and I turn on NBC News
trump, It is so bad
trump, I think NBC, that's not only MSDNC
trump, I think NBC with Lester Holt
trump, There's another beauty
trump, Hi Lester
trump, How do you feel big in second place Lester He surged from first place to second place
trump, But NBC News is so, I mean, it's just terrible
trump, They use free airwaves, and then they give you fake news
trump, Free airwaves
trump, They should pay a lot of money for this
trump, This is not right
trump, NBC
trump, It's owned by a company called Concast, C-O-N, Concast, they're con, they're con men
trump, It's a disgrace
trump, They spend fortunes on public relations and then I get up and make a speech like this with television blazing all over the world, I guess
trump, Yeah, the world, it's all over the world
trump, And I say Concast, and immediately, there goes their public, how's your public relations doing NBC Not too good
trump, But they're just… they don't tell the truth
trump, Our country would be so much better off if we had honest media, really
trump, Really would
trump, And do you see what their approval rating has gone to I think it's one of my greatest achievements
trump, Hey look- It's a Saturday night
trump, We have all night
trump, This happened last night in Minnesota
trump, I have these teleprompter people, they're great, they're genius
trump, And I was about 45 minutes into the speech, and I realized I was only on line two
trump, And he was like, What do I do But we have more fun
trump, Hey, you now have a president that doesn't have to use a teleprompter, isn't that nice And I said last night, I said, and yeah, your friends were there
trump, The Congressmen
trump, By the way, is the media now, and I'm pretty sure it's getting close
trump, I think they have a lower approval rating than Congress
trump, Congratulations
trump, No, but it's hard
trump, When you're sitting there, you're in businesses, you're in construction, you drive trucks, you do a lot of things
trump, You're in offices
trump, You don't realize, because you don't know what's happening
trump, I know exactly a true story
trump, And then it's written to totally bend the truth, to make a good thing into a bad thing
trump, Like, can you believe it, in one week they nominated me, not for one, but for two Nobel prizes
trump, No, but think of it
trump, No but think
trump, And they didn't cover the story
trump, Now Obama got his the first week
trump, Very liberal group, and nobody knew what the hell he got it for, and he didn't know
trump, Why did you get it I don't know
trump, Remember I don't know
trump, I have no idea
trump, But you know, you have a president, you love your president, and your president gets honored, because I'm not being honored, you're being honored with the Nobel Peace Prize, for Israel, what we did with Israel
trump, I went home and I said to the First Lady, Darling, she's very popular
trump, She made a great speech, right And Ivanka made a great speech, right But I went home
trump, I said, Darling, I have big news tonight
trump, Let's turn on the television
trump, You know, we don't use wind
trump, We use actually, we actually use petroleum
trump, We use Petro
trump, Because we like it to be on like a lot
trump, We don't like to have lots of open gaps when the wind's not blowing
trump, We can't watch President Trump
trump, I go home
trump, I say, First Lady, a great thing happened today
trump, I was honored, Nobel Peace Prize, nominated
trump, This is a big thing First Lady
trump, And then I went home two days later
trump, I said, First Lady, you're not going to believe it
trump, I was honored again
trump, Nobel Prize, that's Kosovo
trump, Israel, Kosovo
trump, I said, First Lady, this is great news
trump, Let's turn on the television
trump, This is going to be big
trump, This is going to be big tonight
trump, We just got honored, this is big
trump, Nobel Peace, can you imagine You grow up in Brooklyn, Queens, and now you're getting the… First Lady, let's turn on the television
trump, Let's turn onto that fake NBC news
trump, And I see we have a storm
trump, Okay, First Lady, don't worry about it
trump, The storm is big
trump, We have it taken care of, FEMA's down there, Florida, Alabama, Georgia
trump, We got FEMA down there
trump, It's being taken care of
trump, We always take care of it
trump, We take good care of it
trump, Texas, Louisiana
trump, We took good care of him two weeks ago
trump, All right First Lady, don't worry about it
trump, It's the next story, I'm sure, it's the Nobel Prize for peace
trump, We're stopping mass killings between Kosovo and Serbia
trump, They've been killing each other for so many, they're going to stop killing
trump, I said, fellas, let's get together
trump, They'd been doing it for hundreds of years, frankly, under different names
trump, I said, that's great
trump, And with Israel, UAE and Bahrain signed a deal with Israel
trump, Everybody said it couldn't be done
trump, I said, All right, First Lady, that's the first story on NBC, but don't worry
trump, That's a big story
trump, The floods are big
trump, I see it
trump, And then there was a second story about something
trump, And then their third story is about something with me, I don't know, something bad they found out
trump, Then there was a fourth and a fifth and a sixth
trump, I said, First Lady, I'm a little embarrassed
trump, I thought we'd do a little better
trump, And then they looked at the screen, and said, Good night
trump, And I wasn't covered
trump, I got the Nobel Peace Prize nomination, a Peace Prize, Nobel nomination
trump, And they didn't cover it
trump, And then the following day I watched a certain show that does like us, and they said, Would you believe, that they covered, and they mentioned like five subjects that were nothing
trump, That was 18 minutes
trump, And the Peace Prize Nobel version, zero time for President Trump
trump, Thank you very much fake news media, we appreciate it
trump, And when Obama got it, here are the headlines
trump, President Obama gets the Nobel Prize
trump, We need an honest media
trump, The free airwaves, they lie over the free airwaves
trump, They use them and they lie
trump, I don't know
trump, We're going to have to look at it
trump, They're a bunch of scoundrels
trump, They hate it when I say it, but you know, honestly, they are the enemy of the people
trump, When they lie, they are the enemy of the people
trump, You are the enemy of the people
trump, Oh, damn it
trump, The red lights just went off
trump, One, two, three, there's one back there, there's one back there, probably, oh it's OAN, thank you OAN
trump, Every time I get on this subject, they cover me not because they want to, but we get great ratings
trump, We get ratings
trump, These little deals that we have here, come on in folks, come on in
trump, Look at these people
trump, But you know what I'll tell you what, it's true
trump, They cover it because… But anytime I start talking about the fake news media, you see them getting a little tentative
trump, The camera starts to shake a little bit, and you know, there's another thing
trump, Look at this crowd
trump, It's as far as the eye can see, it's a big crowd, right They never cover it
trump, I said to my wife last night, we had this incredible crowd
trump, A lot of people, thousands and thousands
trump, I mean like 25, 30,000, many people outside couldn't get it
trump, It was like a sea of people
trump, My wife said, Was it a large crowd I said, Did you watch Yes
trump, But they only show your face
trump, And I saw people they never show
trump, And that includes Fox, which has changed a lot, changed a lot, sad
trump, Somebody said, What's the biggest difference between 2016 and now You know what I said, Fox
trump, Biggest difference
trump, Biggest difference
trump, I don't know what's going on with them
trump, But we have some great ones too on Fox
trump, We surged rapid testing kits to every nursing home in America
trump, We learned a lot, through pioneering therapies, we reduced the fatality rate by 85 since April
trump, Think of that 85
trump, We've come up with things
trump, They're waiting to see what's coming over the next few months in terms of therapeutics, which to me is even more important than the vaccine
trump, You go into the hospital, you make people better
trump, You give them a shot, you do a transfusion
trump, You make people better
trump, They walk out, that's to me even better, but ultimately long-term, those vaccines are going to be great, and they're really working out well and it's going to be really soon
trump, The people in certain groups are trying to hold them up as long as possible, as long as possible
trump, They're going to try and give Sleepy Joe the credit
trump, He doesn't even know what a… It's possible
trump, They're going to try and get Sleepy Joe the credit
trump, He doesn't even know what a vaccine is
trump, Europe is almost 30 higher excess mortality than the United States
trump, Does anyone know that they don't report that, right Europe Europe's had a hard time
trump, I'm not looking to hurt them, but they have 30 higher
trump, Our bold and early action saved millions of lives and our decisive economic response saved tens of millions of jobs, including 1
trump,3 million jobs, and a wonderful place called North Carolina, right When I banned travel from China in January, Sleepy Joe Biden called it, That's hysterical
trump, That's xenophobic
trump, What does that mean Tell me what xenophobic means, Sleepy Joe
trump, Who said that I mean, you're my friend
trump, Who said it All right, what a voice
trump, Have you ever tried opera What a voice, did everybody hear that That's true
trump, I wouldn't say it
trump, She said, He has no idea where he is
trump, But I would never say it
trump, I won't say it
trump, I won't say it
trump, I refuse this
trump, No, but don't underestimate him
trump, Look, he's been doing this for 47 years, and I got a debate coming up with this guy
trump, No, it's true
trump, You never know, you never know
trump, They give him a big fat shot in the ass, and he comes out, and for two hours, he's better than ever before
trump, Problem is what happens after the … No, we're going to ask for a drug test, we are
trump, I'd like to have a drug test
trump, Both of us
trump, I'll take it, he'll take
trump, Because I watched him into debates with all those people, those Democrats
trump, The one who treated him worst was Kamala
trump, Actually, also, she was the one that treated, you know that, she was the one that treated him so badly
trump, And she treated Kavanaugh very badly too
trump, Nobody was ever ruder, nobody ever suffered, like Justice Kavanaugh suffered in the hands and the mouths of those horrible people
trump, The way he was tortured was disgraced
trump, And they had nothing
trump, Those women, that was all made up
trump, Most of them have already admitted, it was all made up lies, false accusations, and they made him suffer
trump, And the leader of the pack I would say was, Kamala was the worst, and Pocahontas was a close second
trump, How's Pocahontas doing, since she destroyed Bloomberg How about Bloomberg Did he get killed Now he's trying to come back
trump, He's trying to buy his way back into the Democratic Party
trump, I'm going to put up 100 million in Florida, we're going to go, he wants to be back so badly
trump, Here's a guy who spent 2 billion, it's almost two billion now, they're finding out
trump, He had some of the dumbest advisers, people I know, some of the dumbest people
trump, If he would have just kept spending a couple of hundred million dollars a week on ads, he could have won
trump, He could have won
trump, Unfortunately, he said, No, I want to debate
trump, He went and sued to get into the debates
trump, That was not a good lawsuit
trump, They settled by saying, We'll let you in the debate
trump, The first question, he was destroyed
trump, You would think that, the way the Democrats treated him, he would really come to me, and he'd say, I want you, but his hatred and jealousy … He wanted to be President, but he doesn't have the capability of being President
trump, But he's going down now to Florida, he's going to spend 100 million
trump, How good … I have to say this, I'm not a fan of Elizabeth Warren
trump, I gave her the name Pocahontas, I thought that was the end
trump, Remember what I used to say about her She has … Oh, well, you know it
trump, You know
trump, I would just, look, I said, This is not an Indian
trump, She said, I'm an Indian
trump, You remember what I said I have more Indian blood than me, I have more in me than she has, and I have none
trump, Unfortunately, I'd like to have some
trump, I would like to have some
trump, I think it could help, it might make me better, but I have none
trump, And I said, I have more than she does
trump, And then she went out to, and she choked, remember that She went out, and she took a test
trump, And it found out that about 700 years ago, there was a possible event, 1,024th, right Wasn't that it Good memory, very good memory
trump, Trump has a good memory
trump, Good moment
trump, Not for that, but for a lot of things
trump, Now, 1024th, which meant many, many, many centuries ago, there could have been a hookup somewhere along the line
trump, But she choked
trump, We forced her into a choke
trump, She went down like a rock, and then she started coming up, up, up, up, up
trump, Then she totally destroyed Mike Bloomberg
trump, We call him Mini Mike
trump, Remember Mini Mikey wants that platform
trump, I want a platform, damn it
trump, I don't mind
trump, Oh, boy, he was pathetic, but now he's going to try and buy his way back into the Democrat party
trump, You remember that guy Great environmentalist
trump, Except he made his money with coal, which is okay, I think coal is good
trump, Clean coal, I like clean coal
trump, If we had listened to Joe Biden, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died
trump, You know that
trump, He was way behind
trump, This was months later
trump, And then I watch him last night, reading something saying that, I opened, I closed it up, one week later, one week
trump, Two months later, he was talking about the fact that I shouldn't be doing that to China
trump, I shouldn't be banning China because I was xenophobic
trump, And it's just unbelievable
trump, And now they will say anything
trump, It's called disinformation
trump, They will make up a lie, they will make up a story, and they go with it, it makes no difference whether or not it's show, and they'll take ads
trump, It's the worst group of people
trump, He's surrounded by bad people, dishonest people, but they're very smart
trump, He's not smart
trump, They keep him from talking
trump, It's actually, if he wins, it's the single most brilliant campaign in the history of the world
trump, Because they took a man who's got nothing
trump, He didn't have it, but he's got nothing, and I will give them credit
trump, The single greatest campaign in history, if he wins, but you know what If he wins, North Carolina is screwed, and so is every place else
trump, And you can forget your tobacco industry, you can forget your farmers
trump, I gave the farmers 28 billion
trump, Thank you very much, Presidency
trump, 28 billion
trump, Because you were targeted, right You were targeted by China
trump, And I said, How much were the farmers, Iowa, Nebraska, you, all of them You were targeted
trump, I said, How much Sonny Perdue, I said, How much, Secretary 12 billion, then 16 billion, you were targeted
trump, I took it out of the tariffs we charge
trump, We never took 25 cents in from China, now we're getting billions and billions and billions of dollars
trump, Sleepy Joe, that never gave, never took anything, or Trump, misjudging him So Mexico, we're driving them a little crazy
trump, They don't like Trump too much
trump, But now Biden is recklessly campaigning against his vaccine
trump, His campaign campaign's really reckless
trump, And all it is is for political reasons
trump, It's political reasons
trump, Biden, his whole deal is catastrophic shutdown
trump, We're getting better, we're really coming along, and he's talking about shutting down
trump, We're not doing any shutdowns
trump, We don't need shutdowns
trump, Maybe a little area, if it's such a spike, we understand, we have to take care of our senior citizens
trump, This guy talked, he said, Well, I'll do whatever my medical people want
trump, I believe in science
trump, He doesn't know what science is
trump, I believe in science
trump, No, we're not doing any shutdowns
trump, We don't need, we're rounding the turn
trump, Without the vaccine, we're rounding the turn
trump, With the vaccine, it'll just speed it up
trump, That's another one that will be controversial
trump, They'll say, He's saying that it's happened
trump, Yeah, without the care, without the vaccine, it's going along
trump, With a vaccine, even better
trump, It'll be faster
trump, Biden's own chief of staff said, when they manage the H1N1 that he calls the N1H1, right He goes, the N1H1, and that's an easy one, because H comes before, but he always gets it wrong
trump, It's like, seven times, It's great to be with the great people of Iowa
trump, They'll say, Sir, you're in Idaho
trump, Oh
trump, I've never made that mistake so far
trump, But I always say, If you do, just leave the stage, because you can never recover
trump, You can speak as well as, I mentioned, Winston Churchill, even though he was a great speaker, he was a stutterer, and he became one of the greatest speakers ever
trump, You could be Winston Churchill, if you make that mistake, just leave the stage
trump, You can't recover
trump, But he's made it oftentimes, right, in New Hampshire, and it was Vermont
trump, The worst, I think, I think there was one, he was in Ohio, and he said he was in Florida, right But he couldn't find any palm trees
trump, We just got a poll from Ohio
trump, Through the roof
trump, Great state of Ohio, good Governor, great state of Ohio
trump, But when they managed the H1N1 swine flu, this was from his top person that ran it
trump, We did every possible thing wrong
trump, 60 million Americans got H1N1 in that period of time
trump, And it was just a total disaster
trump, He basically said, We didn't know what the hell we were doing
trump, And this is the guy that's going to tell us what to do with something that's much more lethal, much more lethal
trump, This is much more lethal than the swine flu
trump, If H1N1 had the same fatality rate as the China virus, over two million people would have already perished
trump, They didn't know what the hell they were doing
trump, And the guy admitted it
trump, That guy can not be very popular in Democrat politics right there
trump, But just to remember, and he's telling us how to do things
trump, We're building ventilators, we're the ventilator capital of the world now, think of it
trump, We're sending them to other countries, we have so many
trump, And we have made a lot of Governors look very good
trump, And they all admit it, until the press comes in front, where they say, Oh, he was okay, but we took care of them
trump, We took care of Governors, we took care of the states
trump, On November 3rd, North Carolina will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity, or whether we allow Joe Biden to impose a 4 trillion tax hike, ban American energy, confiscate your guns
trump, These are all things that he said
trump, Shut down our economy, destroy the suburbs
trump, They were saying that women in the suburbs, they're not sure if they like me
trump, They're starting to like me a lot lately, because it's law and order
trump, They want law and order
trump, Thank you
trump, A suburbanite, thank you, thank you
trump, No, it's true
trump, I don't know
trump, But I heard the same thing four years ago, remember  Women will not vote for him
trump, Then we win the election, it's like, they're all in shock
trump, Well, what took place Well, he did very well with women, what the hell was that all about, right Did very well
trump, Women were great
trump, Now, if it holds true … There a lot of jobs, a lot of jobs, a lot of great thinking, but he wants to give free healthcare to illegal aliens
trump, Now, what that's going to do is destroy our country, because two things happen
trump, Number one, we can't afford it
trump, Number two, everybody is going to come pouring into our country if you do that
trump, Right now, they're saying, wherever they are, when you say, We're going to give you free education, we're going to give you free healthcare
trump, We're going to take care of you
trump, Everything's going to be perfect
trump, We're going to give you, every single family, now watch, they'll print this
trump, We've checked it out, and he lied about this
trump, Every single family is going to be given a brand new Silver Cloud Rolls Royce
trump, Now, I said that, and CNN went, He lied about the fact that they're not getting a Rolls Royce
trump, Remember what I said  Russia, if you're listening, in front of this message, Russia, if you're listening, find out where her e-mails, or whatever
trump, And then, everybody laughed, I laughed
trump, Well, they actually play it all the time
trump, When he spoke to Russia
trump, Do you ever see it And they cut it off before the end, they don't see any, I said, Russia, if you're listening … Oh, these people are sick
trump, He wants to erase your borders
trump, Yeah, that was supposed to be a joke, right It was a joke
trump, It was a joke, everybody was laughing, but they refused to go that extra quarter of a second
trump, He wants to indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-American lies in education
trump, To combat the toxic left wing propaganda in our schools, I am launching a new pro-American lesson plan for students called, 1776 Commission
trump, It's already done
trump, That's good
trump, And it's true, your kids come home, and they tell you things
trump, How many of you, the kids come home, and they tell you things
trump, It's a disgrace, what they're teaching them, it's a disgrace
trump, We're ending it
trump, In fact, we're taking school funds away from these crazy schools that are teaching horrible things, bad things, actually
trump, We will teach our children the truth about America, that we are the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth
trump, And we are getting better every single day
trump, And no party can lead America, that will not teach our children to love America
trump, No party can do that
trump, The sleepy campaign has joined forces with those trying to tear down America and our way of life
trump, We have a great way of life, and getting better all the time
trump, Look at what we've done
trump, Biden's running mate urged supporters to help bail rioters out of jail, including one who attempted murder
trump, That's right
trump, One who attempted to murder a police officer, and a man accused of sexually assaulting an eight-year-old girl, 13 members of Biden's staff donated to the same fund
trump, Look, that's where they're coming from, just so you know
trump, He's trying to go a little bit more right, like the fracking
trump, Oh, well of course, we're going to have … For six months, he's saying, there'll be no fracking, which I don't think the people in Pennsylvania thrilled with, do you agree, considering that your taxes could quadruple
trump, I tell it all the time, Texas, right Texas, they like oil
trump, They like guns, right, in Texas
trump, Right And they like God
trump, So he comes out with a platform, no oil
trump, We don't want oil
trump, This is during the Democrat deal
trump, There'll be no oil, there'll be no God, there'll be no guns
trump, This is not a good campaign
trump, And then the fake news says, Donald Trump is tied in Texas
trump, I'm tied
trump, Last time I was tied in Texas until the day of the vote
trump, Then they announced, the second they called it, The polls in Texas have closed
trump, Donald Trump has won the state of Texas
trump, Think of it
trump, He's against oil
trump, He's against guns
trump, They're going to confiscate your guns, Second Amendment's going to be destroyed
trump, I am holding up your Second Amendment
trump, If it's not me, look what I've done
trump, You think it's been easy They want to get rid of the Second Amendment
trump, They're going to get rid of the guns, right And religion
trump, So, look what they're doing to religion
trump, These states, everything's closed, except, you're allowed to protest
trump, That's why I say everything we do is a protest
trump, Look at all those people back there, look at that
trump, Look it, they just form
trump, Wow
trump, Turn the cameras around, please
trump, They never do it
trump, Turn the cameras around, please
trump, Wow
trump, Thank you
trump, That's a lot of people
trump, We're proud of you
trump, That's a lot of people
trump, You ever notice, they never do it, though
trump, I say, Turn the camera
trump, Right from the beginning, they never did
trump, They don't want to give us the credit for these big crowds, because you know what When you see crowds like this, or in Wisconsin, that I had a few nights ago, or last night was so incredible
trump, What we had last night was just incredible, in Minnesota
trump, We're going to win it, 1972, we're going to win it
trump, 1972, it hasn't … That's a long time ago
trump, Remember I think Reagan won every state except for Minnesota
trump, We're going to win Minnesota
trump, What we've done for them, we've opened up their livelihood again
trump, Maine
trump, How about Maine I opened up 5,000 square miles of ocean
trump, Obama closed it
trump, They said, Why He had no idea
trump, Right off their shore, no fishing, no nothing
trump, They called it a monument, right Right off their shore
trump, Maine, I mean, if I don't win Maine … Maine traditionally is not really very Republican, but I won Maine too last time, actually
trump, Because I love Maine, too
trump, I love Maine, too
trump, But think of what I did
trump, I opened the waters up for fishermen and for lobster men and women
trump, Now they go lobster fishing and fishing
trump, But 5, 000, I said, Why did they close it Nobody was able to tell me, but I opened it up, an executive order
trump, I totally opened it up
trump, I did many other things
trump, Then I got the tariffs
trump, They couldn't do business in European Union, they couldn't do business in China, because they were charging tariffs to Maine
trump, So Canada would take our fish and lobster
trump, We'd sell it to Canada for nothing, and they'd sell it to China and Europe, because they didn't have to pay tariffs
trump, Not only did I get the 5,000 … Think of what, 5,000 square miles
trump, So you take one mile, square mile, multiply times 5,000
trump, That's a big area, even in an ocean, right It's massive
trump, And it was the best area, the best
trump, I got rid of the tariffs
trump, I told them, If you tariff our Maine lobster people, and fishermen and women, if you want a tariff on them, that's okay, but we're going to tariff your cars, okay Which is a much bigger deal
trump, It was amazing how quickly those tariffs were taken off
trump, I did that off of Maine, I did that in two weeks, okay Took me two weeks
trump, Once I found out about it, it's hard to believe it ever happened
trump, So I did that for Maine
trump, And somebody said, I'm down in Maine
trump, How the hell can I be down in Maine, after what I did I'll tell you what if I do that from Maine, and if Maine doesn't vote for Trump
trump, I don't think I'm going back, okay I can tell you one thing
trump, Their Senator never did it for them
trump, Joe Biden and the Democrats want to gut police departments nationwide
trump, You know that, right Here in North Carolina, nearly 50 Democrat State House members and candidates have signed a pledge to slash police funding, endangering your families
trump, I was recently honored to be endorsed by 54 sheriffs throughout this state, and we're joined by many of them tonight
trump, Where are they Thank you, Sheriff
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you, folks
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you
trump, You got to take care of our law enforcement
trump, We got to take care, nobody can do the job like them
trump, We have to let them do their job
trump, We've got to stop this nonsense, this child's play, we've got to stop, they're great
trump, You know, I was endorsed by, think of this, New York's finest
trump, It's very tough
trump, You know, de Blasio's your mayor, he doesn't have a clue what's happening, either
trump, I think Sleepy Joe's worse, do you want to know the truth Because this other guy has just an ideology that's just terrible
trump, But de Blasio is there, and New York's finest, first time they've ever endorsed a Presidential candidate, they endorsed me, three weeks ago
trump, That takes courage
trump, Think of it
trump, Chicago, the police in Chicago, they could do their job
trump, We don't even have to bring in the National Guard
trump, Whenever we do, it takes about 30 minutes, it's over, right Like we did in Minneapolis, 30 minutes
trump, Remember that beautiful scene They lined up, they went down, there was no social distancing in between these great, tough guys
trump, There was no social distancing, Tom Tillis
trump, They went down and they had 250,000 outfits
trump, They had more crap on that helmet with night goggles
trump, And these guys were sort of wise guys, right They were shouting at them, screaming at them
trump, They were screaming at the wrong people
trump, They went down, they never had to stop
trump, It was just forward
trump, It all ended
trump, It all ended in Minneapolis
trump, It took, you also had, what A half an hour Remember, they hit the CNN reporter in the knee He went down, Ali Velshi
trump, He said, This is a friendly protest
trump, It's wonderful to see such a … Behind him, it was all fire for a block
trump, It looked like Berlin during the war
trump, This is a friendly … What are they doing How does that help to be like that How does that help We're joined tonight by some really great friends of mine and some warriors that have been a fantastic help to me
trump, One man who, especially over the last year, he has been so great, he couldn't be better
trump, And I think he's doing very well
trump, I'm looking at some numbers, and you're doing very well
trump, And I think your opponent has some very big problems
trump, Senator Tom Tillis
trump, Thank you, Tom
trump, Thank you
trump, He's been great, smart guy
trump, And he's got a couple of bills that he's putting in, one in particular, I love it
trump, You got to do it
trump, That if a sanctuary city causes problems, you can sue the sanctuary city, you can sue
trump, Will you get, we got to get that one moving, right That's moving along, right That's a great one
trump, A man who, I just did a phone call for the other night, and the people love him
trump, He's in a rough district, but he's now leading
trump, I see you're up in the polls, Congressman Richard Hudson, great guy
trump, Where's Richard Great guy
trump, He's a warrior
trump, And two people I really liked, because we fought like hell for them a year ago, right And they had guts, and they had what it takes
trump, They didn't choke
trump, You know, a lot of people choke
trump, They choke, they gag, they can't breathe
trump, Greg Murphy and Dan Bishop, they didn't choke, they're fantastic
trump, They are fantastic people
trump, Thank you
trump, Look, they're friends
trump, We're friends
trump, Those two guys were incredible
trump, Thank you very much, great job
trump, Really great job
trump, And a man that should be your Governor, I don't know, he's doing well, but Lieutenant Governor, Dan Forest, everybody
trump, Thank you very much, great job
trump, Handsome guy, handsome
trump, Looks like Cary Grant
trump, I hear you're doing really well
trump, Look, I mean, this guy's got this state totally closed down
trump, It's ridiculous
trump, It's, when are they going to open When are they going to open Dan, this would have been opened up a long time ago
trump, And you would have done even better
trump, I mean, you would have done better
trump, And North Carolina Republican Party Chair, Michael Whatley
trump, Michael Thank you, Michael
trump, Great job, Michael
trump, How are we doing, Michael How's it going Are we up I mean, if I lose North Carolina, I'm getting out of here
trump, This is not … Look at that
trump, This is not, just so you know, the crowd of a man that's coming in second
trump, I say it all the time
trump, I said it when I left Michigan
trump, 2016, the night of the election, we had 32,000 people
trump, Hillary was there, just before me, in a prime location
trump, She had about 400 people
trump, I got there at 12 in the evening, I started speaking at one in the morning, it's now Election Day, and I left
trump, 32,000 people, we had 32,000 people
trump, So it's now Election Day
trump, I start speaking, I started speaking, think of it, one o'clock in the morning, we had 30, you never saw anything like it
trump, I left
trump, I said, That doesn't look like we're going to lose Michigan
trump, And guess what We didn't
trump, We won Michigan, first time in decades
trump, And you know what we've done Many, many car plants are now opening up
trump, A great gentleman, who's just retiring, Prime Minister Abe, of Japan
trump, I said, Shinzo, please do me a favor
trump, We need more car companies
trump, You're selling cars into our country, please
trump, We want to build here, not in Japan, please
trump, He said, But we cannot do that
trump, This is a free enterprise system
trump, I said, I know, Shinzo, please
trump, I need some car companies
trump, Please do it
trump, I can't do it
trump, I said, Shinzo, you have to do it
trump, Next day, it was a story, Five car companies to open up in Michigan, right So much for free enterprise, but he's a great guy, he's a friend of mine
trump, He's great
trump, They're lucky he's a friend of mine
trump, I would have been much tougher
trump, It's hard
trump, When a guy is a friend, it's hard, but they did a lot
trump, They did a lot
trump, They helped it a lot
trump, And what they've done here, by the way, Japan, and what they've done in Michigan, Ohio, what they've done By the way, we all love South Carolina, right, right I think we love it
trump, Now, South Carolina, we're winning here, but South Carolina, I hate to say this to you, I don't want to make you upset
trump, We're winning by about 400 points
trump, I spoke to a great person in South Carolina who said, Sir, you don't have to come here
trump, This thing's up by a lot
trump, What the hell is the difference, right I mean, we are up, and we're up good, but I'd love you to tie South Carolina
trump, What do we have to do But a lot of activity in South Carolina also, they're doing great
trump, You had the best year you've ever had
trump, They've had the best year they ever had
trump, And you're going to go to a better year, we are going to have a better year
trump, We're also deeply honored to be joined by a military spouse, Amy Williams, who was reunited with her husband, Sergeant First Class Townsend Williams, at my State of the Union address
trump, Everybody remembers that
trump, Everybody remembers was there
trump, Good, you're looking well
trump, Thank you very much
trump, Say hello to the whole family
trump, Thank you
trump, Thanks to the incredible sacrifices of our warriors, and they are warriors
trump, We're pursuing peace in Afghanistan, it's very close
trump, We're down to, we will soon be down to 4,000 soldiers
trump, We're taking them out
trump, They're serving as policemen
trump, They're serving as police, and they've done a great job
trump, We could win everything, but I'm not looking to kill three million people to win, what To win what We should have never been in the Middle East, and we're bringing them back
trump, We're bringing them back, just so you know, we're bringing them back from Iraq
trump, We're down to 2,000 soldiers in Iraq
trump, And in Syria, we're all back, we're all finished, except for one thing
trump, If it's okay with you
trump, I decided to keep the oil
trump, We took the oil, we kept it
trump, And we'll always support America's incredible military families
trump, So thank you very much
trump, Thank you, darling
trump, Really good
trump, Okay
trump, In everything we do, we're putting America first, unlike other administrations, and not just Obama and Biden
trump, This has gone on for many years
trump, We put America first, and that's what we're doing
trump, And you know what Other countries, for the first time in decades, respect us again
trump, Remember that
trump, They respect us again
trump, You know all about data, 28 countries
trump, We had six countries that were current, and the amount of current is too low, okay Six countries
trump, I went in, and I said, You got to pay
trump, Sorry, you're delinquent
trump, They said, Really Yeah, I said
trump, You're delinquent
trump, You got to pay
trump, Obama would go, and make a speech and leave, that would be it
trump, We were paying for it
trump, We're protecting Europe, and they're screwing us on trade
trump, So we protect them, and they're screwing us on trade
trump, No good, no good
trump, Can't do it
trump, I said, It's unfair
trump, And the Secretary General, Stoltenberg, of NATO, said, I've never seen, and the fake news can call him up and check
trump, He said, He's the greatest that we've ever seen
trump, For 20 years, the spending at NATO went like this, right And America, we pick it up
trump, Every time it goes down, they didn't pay
trump, And I said, We're supposed to protect you
trump, You're going to be attacked by Russia or somebody, we're supposed to protect you
trump, And yet you're delinquent
trump, You don't pay your bills
trump, And that includes Germany
trump, They're paying 1, they're supposed to pay two, and 2 is way too low
trump, 2 military spending
trump, So we got, listen to this
trump, It never gets reported by these fakers
trump, We got 130 million more, more, not total, more, going to, over three years, 400 billion
trump, So we're going from 130 billion, with a B, not million, to 400 billion
trump, And they said to me, they said … And they said to me, they said to me, very nice guy, head of one of the countries, at a table
trump, I can't believe it never got released, but now we can talk about it, because it's three years ago
trump, But they said, Sir …  And this was a big private meeting of all of the nations, Does that mean if we don't …  Because I said, You got to pay your bills
trump, We're protecting you
trump, You're not paying your bills
trump, Some did, like Poland and some others, but most didn't
trump, Six to eight were current, and we were paying much more than we should have been paying, much more
trump, I mean, it's Europe
trump, We got to defend ourself, and there was no guarantee that they'd help us if we ever had a problem
trump, Right We're never going to have a problem
trump, We got so much stuff now
trump, We were depleted
trump, Now we have great … But they said to me, Does this mean …  And I had to give this answer
trump, I can't believe it didn't get leaked by some sleazebag
trump, We have leakers all over this place, but a lot of it didn't leak
trump, A lot of it is just made up by the newspapers
trump, They make up phony stories
trump, They say, Donald Trump woke up today
trump, He was in a very bad mood, according to sources
trump, There is no source
trump, They just made it up
trump, Hey, I woke up, and I was in a bad mood
trump, True
trump, I've actually had a … I've been in a good mood, because we're doing so much for our country
trump, We've done so much for our country
trump, But at the NATO meeting, one of the presidents of one of the good countries, all good, they said, Sir, does this mean that if we don't pay, does this mean that you're going to leave, and you're not going to protect us I said, Yes
trump, That's what it means
trump, I'm sorry
trump, It was an amazing effect, because other presidents said, No
trump, We will always protect you
trump, We will always protect you, even if you don't pay, even if our taxpayer is paying for everything, even though you take advantage of us on trade, you don't let our cars in, you don't let our stuff in, but you sell us like crazy, even though you tariff our product, even though you do everything, and then you take advantage of us with the military
trump, They said, We will always protect you
trump, So they didn't pay
trump, Why the hell would they pay They said, Boy, these guys are stupid
trump, So they asked me the question, Does this mean, sir, that you will not protect us anymore if we don't pay I said, I'm sorry to say, it does
trump, That's a big story
trump, Three years ago, it's a big story
trump, It was amazing how the money came in
trump, So we took in 130 billion a year, going over a three-year period, to 400, just because I asked
trump, Right Just because I asked
trump, True
trump, They don't report that story
trump, Then we got lightweights that I fired, and they write books about me, that I'm a bad guy, Oh, he's a terrible guy
trump, He treats our allies so badly
trump, No
trump, Our allies treat us badly
trump, Our allies in many ways treat us worse than our enemies
trump, I must be honest with you
trump, They take advantage of us
trump, Everyone takes advantage of your country, and we don't put up with it
trump, And you know what the funny thing We get along better now, because they respect us again
trump, Before, they thought we were stupid
trump, They respect us again
trump, They do
trump, I mean, look at Israel, look what we did
trump, I saw Kerry this other day
trump, Is this guy the worst negotiator Gave Iran 150 billion, plus 1
trump,8 billion in cash
trump, He never walked
trump, Sometimes in a negotiation, when you've given everything, and you can't give anymore, and then they want more, you get up ane walk
trump, Remember the bicycle accident That was the only time he had to ride his bicycle in a race
trump, 73 years old
trump, I promise, I said, I will never ever … I promise to you, ride a bicycle in a race, or any other time frankly
trump, I will never ride a bicycle during a negotiation
trump, And he broke his leg, and his arm, and he was all screwed up
trump, And that was actually a good thing, because it delayed the signing of that horrible deal, which I terminated
trump, Nah, we had some terrible negotiators, and they all said, I saw them the other day, this was him like a year ago, Mark my words, you will never ever sign deals with Arab countries, with Israel
trump, It can't be done
trump, Well, we just signed the two great ones, and we got about seven more that want to come in
trump, What a bunch, what a bunch
trump, And then they say bad things about your president
trump, They don't like my foreign policy
trump, I like my foreign policy
trump, You like it
trump, No, we were taken advantage of by the whole world
trump, They're so stupid, so stupid
trump, We've spent the last four years reversing the damage that Biden and his crew inflicted on us over a 47-year period
trump, Joe Biden is weak
trump, He's supported every globalist sellout of North Carolina, the workers, what he's done
trump, And when I say, him, it's him and people in his little group that … You've achieved so much over a period of time
trump, He sold it out
trump, Look at NAFTA
trump, How bad was NAFTA China's entry into the World Trade Organization
trump, TPP would have destroyed our car industry
trump, And of course, he joined and wanted to join the Paris Climate Accord
trump, That's another beauty
trump, That would have cost you trillions and trillions of dollars
trump, That was actually, I think, designed to put us out of business, literally
trump, Biden has repeatedly surrendered your jobs to China and other countries
trump, This state lost 43 of all manufacturing jobs after the NAFTA and China disasters
trump, You know that
trump, You lost 43, but I think the real number is 61, by the way
trump, Biden says that this an election between Scranton and Park Avenue
trump, By the way, he left Scranton
trump, He likes to say, I was born in Pennsylvania
trump, But he doesn't say he left
trump, His father left
trump, Not his fault, but they make it like he's … No, he went to Delaware
trump, He doesn't leave Delaware, that I can tell you
trump, Every time I see this guy … Wilmington, Delaware
trump, Does he ever leave I'm in Los Angeles
trump, I'm trying to work on the fires
trump, They ought to do some forest management a little bit maybe
trump, Ridiculous
trump, The floors of the forest, it's got 20 years of leaves and trees that are dry as a bone, matchsticks
trump, Forest management
trump, Naturally, this is an election, not between Scranton or wherever it is
trump, It's really between Scranton and China, you know that, Scranton and China
trump, I'm with America
trump, Biden is with China
trump, If Biden wins, China wins
trump, If we win, America wins, North Carolina wins, Pennsylvania wins, and the American workers win in every single state
trump, To save our auto industry, I withdrew from this horrible, horrible deal, Trans-Pacific Partnership
trump, Earlier this year, I kept my promise to North Carolina when I ended the NAFTA nightmare
trump, You got hit so hard
trump, All those empty buildings all over the place, but a lot of them now are filled up because of us
trump, They filled up
trump, When did they fill up Over the last three-and-a-half years
trump, I proudly signed a brand new US-Mexico-Canada agreement into law, which will bring hundreds of thousands of high paying jobs back to the United States, and it's already doing
trump, We invested 2
trump,5 trillion in the US military
trump, Defense spending in North Carolina has soared by more than 1 billion a year
trump, Congratulations, good job
trump, We launched the first new branch of the US Armed Forces
trump, This by itself would be a big achievement
trump, This is one of so many different things, Right to Try, the military, the vets, everything
trump, We've done so much, but we … 75 years, right Last one was the Air Force
trump, The Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marines, the Coast Guard, they're so good
trump, We have another one now, for 75 years, Space Force
trump, We need it
trump, I never even promised that
trump, Right One of them said recently that, He's actually done more than he promised in the campaign
trump, That means I'm probably the only politician in history
trump, They will tell you, these incredible women up here from North Carolina
trump, Stand up
trump, Will you, please These are most incredible people
trump, Thank you
trump, Stand up
trump, Turn around for the cameras, so they can see how incredible you are
trump, Thank you
trump, Man, oh, man
trump, What a life
trump, But we took care of the VA with Veterans Choice
trump, You saw that
trump, What Obama was nothing
trump, It wasn't working, the MISSION Act
trump, That's amazing
trump, And accountability, where we can fire people in the VA that aren't taking great care of our vets, okay You're fired
trump, Get out
trump, You're fired
trump, Out
trump, We killed the founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdad
trump, We took out the worlds number-one terrorist and the mass murder of American troops and many others, Qasem Soleimani
trump, He's dead
trump, He's dead
trump, I withdrew from last administration's disastrous Iran nuclear deal
trump, I kept my promise, recognized the true capitol of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem
trump, And we got it built
trump, I was signing a sheet of paper, you've heard this story, 1
trump,1 billion
trump, I said, What's this for They said, Sir, now that you've moved, we're going to build an embassy in Israel, in Jerusalem
trump, I say, How much is it 1
trump,1 billion
trump, You got some friends of mine here, they're builders
trump, You don't spend 1
trump,1 billion on a one-story building
trump, I don't know what's going on
trump, So I said, So, does it have to cost so much Yes, sir
trump, We're buying land So I called David Friedman
trump, He's our ambassador, he's one of the most successful lawyers in New York
trump, He's a brilliant guy
trump, He loves Israel
trump, Right Love Israel
trump, I call him
trump, He's the ambassador, he's there
trump, I said, David, they want to spend 1
trump,1 billion on a damn one-story embassy
trump, It's crazy
trump, I said, Would you take a look Maybe we own some land
trump, We own a lot of land
trump, We've been there a long time
trump, Calls me back
trump, He said, Let me take a look at it, sir
trump, He calls me the next day
trump, Sir, we have a great piece of land, a much better location that we were going to way overpay for, a much bigger piece
trump, We have a setback building that we can renovate and make it great
trump, I said, That's fantastic, David
trump, How much will it cost to renovate the building I think we can do it for 190,000
trump, So I said, David, it's the first time I've ever done it
trump, I said, David, it's too cheap
trump, You got to spend more than that
trump, So a friend of mine, Ron Baron, he's got an office building, and he's got Jerusalem stone facing the elevators in this high-rise building, Jerusalem stone
trump, And every time I go in, he goes, Oh, you got to see Jerusalem stone
trump, And he paid a fortune for it
trump, He's so proud of it
trump, He doesn't talk about anything but his Jerusalem stone
trump, I said, David, do me a favor
trump, You're I Jerusalem
trump, Right Yes
trump, Do they have Jerusalem stone They got so much, we don't know what to do with it
trump, I said, Use all Jerusalem stone when you're rebuilding the building, when you do your renovation
trump, Everything, wrap it in Jerusalem stone
trump, So I think we ended up spending, to fix up the building, like 500,000
trump, Can you believe it We were going to spend 1
trump,1 billion, and by the way, it would never get built
trump, It wouldn't be built in 20 years from now
trump, And they like it so much, they gave up the plan
trump, They think this is better
trump, It's a better location, it's probably a better building
trump, But I could tell you stories like that all night long, the aircraft carriers that cost 10 times more than they should cost, and then they use the electric catapults
trump, You've heard that
trump, Right They don't want to use steam
trump, Why Because it's too simple, because it works, because it's better
trump, So they go to electric catapults that they're working on for years now
trump, Elevators that are operated my magnets instead of hydraulic
trump, Magnets
trump, It sounds good
trump, Trust me, it doesn't work
trump, One little glass of water
trump, We're in the ocean
trump, One little glass of water, boom, those magnets are gone
trump, I could have told them that
trump, I actually asked the architect,  Have you ever built a ship before It's unbelievable
trump, You heard the story last night about Air Force One
trump, It saved a lot of money
trump, I said to Boeing, No
trump, It's got to have a three in front of it
trump, They were going to buy Air Force One, 5
trump,7 billion
trump, It's a lot of money, but look, it's a helluva a deal
trump, It's a helluva a plane
trump, What can I tell you
trump, I said, How much is the new plane It was signed by Obama
trump, 5
trump,7 billion, sir
trump, I said, That's a lot of money
trump, It's actually two planes
trump, Air Force One is two planes
trump, I'll give you a little
trump, They're going to say, That's classified information
trump, Well, they've been flying around with two planes for 30 years, so I assume somebody knows
trump, And our Air Force One is 31 years old
trump, Right So, look, it's time
trump, A lot of the Arab sheiks come in
trump, I see their plane
trump, They have a brand new one
trump, I say, What do we have 31 years, and we're protecting them
trump, Why the hell don't we have a new one So they finally had, at 31 years old
trump, The new one is totally different, 747
trump, It's much longer, bigger wingspan, much more beautiful
trump, It's modern, it's beautiful
trump, 5
trump,7 billion
trump, So I said to the head of Boeing, nice guy, Dennis, this was before they had their difficulty, which is terrible what happened to them, but I said to him, Dennis, I'm not going to spend 5
trump,7 billion on a plane
trump, I'm not going to do it
trump, I won't do it
trump, It's too much
trump, I said last night, I told this story, first time, I said, It's got to have a three on it
trump, He said, We can't do it
trump, No
trump, He called me up the following day, We'll take 200 million off
trump, Somebody said, Well, what are you losing I said, Nothing
trump, In fact, we're gaining a generator
trump, And I said, You got to build an extra generator
trump, He said, We'll take 200 million off
trump, I said, Nope
trump, I said to the general in charge, I said, General, can we break the deal Yes, sir, we can
trump, We have a cancellation clause
trump, Good
trump, General, execute your cancellation clause
trump, We're not going to buy it
trump, I'm not going to pay 5
trump,7 billion for Air Force One
trump, I'm not doing it
trump, He said, Yes, sir
trump, I'm very proud of this clause
trump, Why Why Because we have the right to cancel
trump, Well, do we have to pay anything Yes, sir, 250 million
trump, I said, General, don't cancel it
trump, Take it back
trump, Just tell them we don't like the plane
trump, Okay And I couldn't even say, I'm going to buy it from Europe
trump, The only competitor is Europe
trump, I can't say, We'll buy it from Europe
trump, No, that doesn't work out to well
trump, So I said, Don't do it
trump, I don't want to send them a check
trump, 250 million for nothing
trump, Right We don't want to do it
trump, So I said, Just tell them, We don't like it
trump, The price is too high
trump, We're not going to buy it
trump, But don't send anything, don't put it in writing
trump, Please, general
trump, Yes, sir
trump, Thank you
trump, So about a week later, the head of Boeing called me up
trump, He said, Look, we can get it down, but you're asking for too much
trump, I said, You don't understand
trump, It has to have a three on it, not a four, but three
trump, So another months goes by
trump, I forgot about it
trump, I get a call from Boeing, Would 3
trump,9 billion be okay I said, Yes, that's okay
trump, It's got a three on it
trump, True
trump, True story
trump, True story, and then somebody said … it's true though, somebody said, Well, it must be a different plane
trump, Yeah
trump, I said, Yeah, we have a much nicer paint job
trump, We have a much nicer paint job, you know that, and it actually got an extra generator put on
trump, Okay So it's actually more
trump, They said, well, we could use an extra generator
trump, I said, Is there anything else you need They said, Sir, we could use an extra generator
trump, I said, We'll get it for you, we'll get it
trump, So I had it included in the price
trump, These people know exactly what I'm talking about
trump, It's called included in the price
trump, But think of it, there's hundreds of deals like that
trump, But you're one person, and that's why I got Mark Meadows involved, because he's from North Carolina
trump, He's from North Carolina, and he's cheap as hell
trump, I need some cheap people
trump, Oh, there's many, hundreds and hundreds of stories
trump, I could tell you so much
trump, It's crazy
trump, The Biden agenda would collapse our economy and destroy your country
trump, It would destroy your Social Security and protections for preexisting conditions, it will
trump, He's going to drain your Medicare by giving away our healthcare to illegal immigrants
trump, And I will tell you this, you're going to have socialized medicine
trump, That's as sure as you're there
trump, And Obama lied 28 times when he said you can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan
trump, It was a lie
trump, Said it 28 times, that we have, but it was a lie
trump, But now you're really losing your doctor
trump, You're going to have socialized medicine
trump, Eliminate private healthcare insurance for 180 million Americans who love their healthcare
trump, They have the best in the world
trump, His running mate sponsored the socialist takeover of healthcare
trump, You saw that
trump, He wants to ban private insurance
trump, You're going to lose … 180 million people are going to lose their healthcare under this Biden character, and he has no clue
trump, They're going to take it away from him
trump, They're going to be running him ragged
trump, Sign this
trump, Sign this
trump, Okay
trump, What is it Doesn't matter
trump, Just sign it, President, right now
trump, I'm getting tired
trump, I'd like to rest, I'd like to let Kamala take over as president
trump, That's no way to get into the office, because we're going to have a woman president someday, but you know what It can't be Kamala
trump, Kamala
trump, Nobody treated him worse, and he picked her
trump, I'll tell you, I was … brilliant forecast
trump, He could never pick her
trump, She called him a racist
trump, Right She talked about Me Too-ing him
trump, He was going to be Me Too-ed
trump, Right Me-Too-ed
trump, A lot of bad things
trump, There was nobody
trump, Think of it, even Pocahontas treated him better
trump, She knocked the hell out of Bloomberg, but she left him sort of alone
trump, I think she felt sorry for him
trump, I heard she felt sorry for him
trump, I don't want people to feel sorry for our president
trump, I want other people, really, to feel sorry for themselves, because we have somebody that knows what they're doing
trump, We can't have it
trump, We can joke, we can play games, we can have fun
trump, You can't have this guy as your president
trump, You can't have him
trump, Maybe I'll sign an executive order
trump, You cannot have him as your president
trump, No, but you know this
trump, Everybody knows this
trump, And you know what People are going to vote for him because they feel sorry for him
trump, I feel sorry for him too
trump, I feel sorry for him
trump, And maybe he'll show up for an hour-and-a-half at a debate
trump, Who the hell knows I don't know
trump, But you know
trump, You see the condition he's in
trump, You can't have him as your president
trump, And you know what You can't have her as your vice president, potentially going to be president
trump, And that's why they're pushing so hard, because they know he's going to be out very soon, and she's going to take over
trump, And she is the furthest left person of anybody
trump, She is rated, not by me, she is rated further left than even Bernie Sanders
trump, Okay He's second, she's first
trump, We will hire more police
trump, Thank you, sheriffs
trump, Thank you, sheriffs
trump, I love the sheriffs
trump, We got the endorsement from all the sheriffs in Florida, everybody up in Ohio and Texas
trump, We have the stuff, nobody's ever seen anything like it, the endorsements from law enforcement
trump, We're going to increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement
trump, We will ban deadly sanctuary cities
trump, We will defeat everybody that we have to, including the virus, but we will defend the dignity of work, and we will defend the sanctity of life
trump, We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms
trump, We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens, and we will keep … You know this, right It's okay, right We will keep America out of these ridiculous foreign wars
trump, We will maintain American's unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength
trump, It's about time
trump, We will end surprise medical bills, require price transparency, and further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs, which we're doing an unbelievable job on, other than the fact that the drug companies are spending a fortune, because they don't like me much
trump, You will see drug prices, prescription drugs, dropping 50, 60, 70 in a very short period of time
trump, Favored nations clauses
trump, We will strongly protect Medicare and Social Security, and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions
trump, America will land the first woman on the moon, and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars
trump, You have to see what we've done with NASA
trump, We'll be the first one on Mars, I hope
trump, We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriot education to our schools, patriotic education
trump, We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag
trump, And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, and we will never change it, by the way
trump, We will never change it
trump, They took the word, God, out of the Pledge of Allegiance twice
trump, I said, Did they make a mistake
trump, Did they make a mistake
trump, They didn't for them
trump, They made a mistake for us
trump, We're not going to put up with it
trump, But we will keep, In God we trust
trump, For years, you had a president who apologized for America
trump, Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of North Carolina
trump, This is the most important election we've ever had
trump, Remember it
trump, We're going to be a socialist country
trump, We're going to be a communist country
trump, These people are further … they're much further left than socialism
trump, These people are sick
trump, So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and get out and vote
trump, Get out and vote
trump, And watch to make sure they're not cheating, which they will be
trump, Early voting has already begun
trump, Don't wait
trump, Get out and vote
trump, We got to win this
trump, If we win this state, we're going to win the whole thing
trump, This is a very important state
trump, If we win North Carolina, we're going to win the whole thing, because we're doing well everywhere, from Wilmington to Charlotte, from Concord to Raleigh, and from Greensboro to right here in Fayetteville
trump, We inherit the legacy of generations of North Carolina patriots, who gave their blood, sweat and tears for this beloved nation
trump, Proud citizens like you, helped build this country
trump, And together, we are taking back our country
trump, We are returning power to you, the American people
trump, With your help, with your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning
trump, You hear that, General We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God

trump, Thank you and Vice President Mike Pence, thank you very much
trump, Incredible
trump, And, hello to Fayetteville
trump, Hello, Fayetteville
trump, It's great to be here in North Carolina's ninth congressional district with the hardworking patriots who believe in faith, family, God and country
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you
trump, Tomorrow you'll head to the polls to elect a congressman who always puts America first, Dan Bishop
trump, I've just come from a meeting with North Carolina officials representing communities hit by Hurricane Dorian and I expressed the unwavering solidarity of the American people, we are behind you 100
trump, 100
trump, The prayers of our entire nation are with the citizens of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida and everyone else that was in the storms path, and I will say I was called by the government of The Bahamas and we're helping with The Bahamas
trump, They were hit so hard
trump, They were hit so hard
trump, Who would believe it We pledged the full support of the federal government through every step of the rebuilding process
trump, And I will say, North Carolina in our country probably got hit the hardest
trump, That was a little bit of a surprise, but I know one thing about North Carolina
trump, You can take it and you'll build it quickly and you'll build it beautifully
trump, And, you'll be back sooner then anybody ever thought and it'll be better then ever
trump, Right No doubt about it
trump, I also want to give a special recognition to the many non-governmental organizations doing so much to help people recover from Dorian, in particular, Franklin Graham
trump, He's a wonderful guy
trump, He's got an organization, Samaritan's Purse, based right here in North Carolina and the work that Franklin and his family and all of those that are with Franklin Graham we want to thank them
trump, Special, great people
trump, Great People
trump, Thank you Franklin
trump, Thank you
trump, Incredible job
trump, He does such a great job
trump, All over, whenever there's a problem you see Samaritan's Purse and Franklin and his people
trump, We love the people of this state and we will never ever leave your side
trump, North Carolina will truly recover so fast
trump, I know you people so well
trump, Let's not even talk about it
trump, Let's not even talk about it
trump, We're here tonight to discuss the extraordinary progress we're making as a nation and how to ensure this amazing resurgence keeps on going and going strong
trump, In just over two years, we've taken this big beautiful ship and it's being turned around very quickly
trump, Nobody thought this would happen
trump, You know we won the greatest election, certainly one of them, but maybe the greatest, but we won… let's say one of the greatest, this way I won't be criticized
trump, They'll say, You know, George Washington had a great election too
trump, The fake news right
trump, The fake news
trump, But, we won one of the greatest elections in history and because of that, and you would be in big trouble if we didn't, I can tell you that
trump, You'd be… Instead of going up we were heading in the wrong direction
trump, We have the number one economy anywhere in the world
trump, And every time I meet a foreign leader, almost every time, they say, Congratulations on what you've done with the economy
trump, I said, I didn't do it
trump, I just set a certain path
trump, The people of the United States did it
trump, Number one anywhere in the world
trump, And they tried to do the recession thing
trump, You know, they tried the Russia thing
trump, That didn't work
trump, They tried many other things
trump, I always say, The media and their partner, the Democrats
trump, I wouldn't mind fighting the Democrats, but we really have to look at it as a two-some
trump, It's the media and the Democrats
trump, It's one and the same
trump, We're rebuilding our military, defending our sovereignty and reclaiming our dignity as a nation
trump, America is winning again and America is respected again
trump, They respect America
trump, By the way, I have about 10 women in the front row and you come from North Carolina and they travel all over the place
trump, Hold up your hands
trump, These are great women
trump, I see them so much, and I must say they have other things to do
trump, They look rich as hell to me, I don't know
trump, How many is this How many rallies have you come too They can't count
trump, They said all of them except for two
trump, That's a lot of rallies and it all emanates from this area
trump, That's so great
trump, Well, at least you won't have to travel so far for this one, right Thank you very much for being here
trump, We really appreciate it
trump, Well, we appreciate it
trump, We appreciate it
trump, Thank you
trump, Really incredible people
trump, But you know, we've created six million new jobs since election day and I couldn't say that in my initial rallies because nobody would have believed it
trump, Six million new jobs
trump, More Americans are working today than ever before in the history of our country
trump, Almost 160 million Americans, nobody would have thought that was possible
trump, We wouldn't have been able to say it actually
trump, We've now had 13 straight months of wage gains of at least 3, so the people that work so hard… You remember I used to say during the rallies before we won, people worked two jobs, three jobs and they made less money then they made 21 years before and now wages are going up, the economy is doing great and jobs have never been better
trump, So importantly, more than 70 million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps
trump, Nearly 600,000 Americans entered the labor force last month alone
trump, Think of that
trump, And the unemployment rate for African-Americans just reached another brand new, yesterday, all time low in the history of our country
trump, How do you lose that debate Remember I used to say, Why do you have to lose Well, now you have the best unemployment numbers, employment and unemployment numbers, that you've ever had as African-Americans, as Asian-Americans, as Hispanic-Americans
trump, The best numbers we've ever had, and by the way, African-American youth unemployment has also reached the lowest level ever recorded in history
trump, And, the labor force participation rate for women is at the highest level now in 15 years, and soon will be 35 years, and soon, I promise, will probably end up being better than ever
trump, I can tell you the unemployment numbers for women are the best they've been now in 72 years
trump, So, I always say kiddingly, I'm sorry I didn't make it historic, but you know what It's going to be historic very soon
trump, It'll be historic very soon
trump, And, here in North Carolina, over 230,000 more people now have jobs and small business formation has skyrocketed by more than 25
trump, Amazing
trump, But, the radical democrats want to dismantle, demolish, and destroy everything that you've gained, and they will do it, and it won't take that long
trump, And, that's why we need Dan Bishop and Greg Murphy
trump, We need them
trump, We need them going down
trump, We need them going down to congress and helping
trump, But, they can do it
trump, It's also why we need four more years
trump, It has to… See, it's like a plant
trump, We've changed things, right Keep America Great
trump, We've changed things, but it's gotta grow
trump, It's gotta develop those roots
trump, And, once it does, it's going to be very hard for them to destroy what we've done
trump, Very hard
trump, And, that's really why I consider this election… Look, we had a very, very special day in 2016
trump, It was a very special day
trump, Very special day
trump, It was an incredible day, an incredible month, an incredible year, and I don't know that you can ever compare anything to it
trump, But, I can say this, 2020 is essentially just as important, because they'll try and take it away
trump, Whether it has to do with religion
trump, Our evangelicals are here tonight, and they're all over the place
trump, And, what we've done for them, and for religion, is so important
trump, You know, the other side, I don't think they're big believers… They're not big believers in religion
trump, That I can tell you
trump, You listen to some of them
trump, They're trying, and they're trying put out little statements
trump, They're not working too well
trump, Little statements that are a little bit, sort of, not too good, huh What is the word we want to use Yeah, a little… Nah
trump, Nah
trump, They're pushing a little hard, and it's not working
trump, To stop the far left, you must vote in tomorrow's special election
trump, So important
trump, Or, get your votes in early
trump, I think a lot of… Who voted early for Dan Bishop Good
trump, Well, that's good, but the big thing is tomorrow
trump, Tomorrow is the election, and you'll get out
trump, To protect your family, you must defeat open borders
trump, And, you have Democrat named Dan McCready, and he wants open borders
trump, He wants sanctuary cities
trump, He's not going to protect your Second Amendment
trump, He's doing nothing on your Sec… You know, North Carolina's a very big Second Amendment state
trump, And, Dan Bishop, Greg Murphy, these guys, they're going to protect your Second Amendment
trump, But, one of the biggest issues in this election is, in fact, sanctuary cities
trump, McCready supports sanctuary city policies that force prisons and jails to release criminal aliens directly into your neighborhoods
trump, Get out
trump, Go ahead
trump, Go into the neighborhood
trump, Go into… What's your neighborhood
trump, Where do you… What Rutherford County Okay
trump, So, how do you feel about having them released, hardened, horrible criminals into Rutherford County I don't think so
trump, But, your whole state… Honestly… Can I be honest It's crazy what's happening
trump, This whole thing with sanctuary cities, and you go to California, which is so many sanctuary cities, they don't know what's happening out there
trump, You have people that want to get ride of those sanctuary cities, they just aren't able to do it with the people that get elected
trump, A lot of illegal voting going on out there, by the way, a lot of illegal voting
trump, In August, McCready said it was the right call to set illegal alien criminals loose in the great state… I'm using the words great state
trump, He doesn't
trump, … Of North Carolina
trump, With the support and encouragement of McCready, sanctuary jurisdictions in North Carolina have released thousands of dangerous criminal aliens into your communities, and you see it
trump, You see it
trump, The charges against these freed criminals includes sexual assault, robbery, drug crimes, kidnapping, and homicide
trump, Murder
trump, Why would you do it Why would you do it What is it Explain it
trump, Just recently, Mecklenburg County set free an illegal alien charged with first-degree rape and crimes against a child
trump, Support for sanctuary cities is disloyalty to American citizens, and McCready wants sanctuary cities with all of their protections for people that are serious criminals
trump, Tomorrow is your chance to send a clear message to the America-hating left, and it's gotta be
trump, And, by the way, we're building that wall, and it's going up very big
trump, Very big
trump, And, you think it's easy to get money when you have the entire Democrat party… And, they control the House, and we want to change that
trump, We want to flip the house
trump, We'll get so much
trump, It'll be amazing what we can do for our country
trump, We don't want dangerous criminal aliens roaming free in North Carolina
trump, We want to take care of it
trump, This state should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens
trump, Our great Republican candidate, Dan Bishop, will fight with everything he has to stop sanctuary cities and defend the people of this great state
trump, Dan, come on up
trump, Dan Bishop, everyone
trump, Get out and vote
trump, Come on up, Dan
trump, We need a doctor
trump, A doctor in the house, please
trump, A doctor, please
trump, Doctor in the house

trump, That's great
trump, That's really great
trump, Thank you Thank you, sir
trump, Thank you
trump, That's really great
trump, Thank you very much
trump, I guess Dan's speech wasn't so good
trump, What do you think That's great
trump, Thank you very much
trump, Great job
trump, Thank you, Doctor
trump, Thank you, everybody
trump, Thank you, law enforcement
trump, Thank you very much
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you, Dan

trump, And, I believe he's here tonight
trump, I just came in

trump, Thousands and thousands of people who couldn't get in
trump, And, when people wait two or three days to come in and especially these first rows, I just want to tell you we really thank you
trump, Incredible
trump, But, Thom Tillis has really worked with us over the last period of time
trump, He's recently introduced a bill to give American victims the right to sue sanctuary cities
trump, That's a big deal
trump, And hold them accountable for the lives that they've shattered
trump, But, to pass the bill, we need more Republicans
trump, Tomorrow there is another crucial special election, and we have a fantastic guy running in that one, too, Republican Greg Murphy
trump, It looks like he's in good shape, but you've got to get it out
trump, So, I want to introduce Thom Tillis, and I want to introduce Greg Murphy
trump, I want to thank you both
trump, Thank you

trump, Good luck tomorrow, Greg
trump, Get out there and vote for those two guys
trump, They're terrific
trump, We're thrilled to be joined tonight by many more terrific Republican leaders
trump, A man who's really been stepping up to the front
trump, He defended Justice Kavanaugh when he was treated so badly
trump, I've never seen anything like the treatment that Justice Kavanaugh received
trump, And, everybody respects him, and everybody likes him
trump, And, I like him, and we used to fight like hell, right But, we don't fight anymore
trump, We like each other a lot, and he's a special man
trump, And, he's become a special friend
trump, Senator Lindsay Graham
trump, Another man who is a fighter… I guess we're all fighters
trump, You have to be a fighter or you're not going to be here very long
trump, I can tell you that
trump, We've got to fight them more than anybody else
trump, But, a man who's done an incredible job in Washington, took over a rough situation, and he's become a real leader, and that's Republican Leader, Kevin McCarthy
trump, Kevin
trump, Kevin's working so hard for so many different people
trump, He wants to see Dan and Greg win so badly
trump, Thank you for being here
trump, Appreciate it, Leader
trump, Representative David Rouzer
trump, David, thank you
trump, David Rouzer
trump, He's done a fantastic job
trump, Our lieutenant governor who is going to be, I think, a highly competitive candidate for a very important race, Dan Forest
trump, Thank you, Dan
trump, Thank you very much, Dan
trump, We also have North Carolina Republican Party Chair, Michael Whatley
trump, What a job you've done
trump, And, we have a man from North Carolina who loves this state
trump, He fights so hard
trump, He doesn't know what it is not to fight
trump, You know who I'm talking about They got it, Mark
trump, You're all screaming, Mark Meadows
trump, That's right
trump, He's great
trump, So many
trump, Jim Jordan, Andy Biggs, Gaetz, and… I just got so… By the way, Devin Nunez
trump, Devin Nunez
trump, How about Devin He was out there when it wasn't in vogue to be saying that Comey was a stone cold liar and leaker
trump, But, he knew it all the time, Devin Nunez
trump, But, Mark Meadows is pretty incredible, and do they love… … but Mark Meadows has been incredible, and do they love him in your state
trump, Do they love Mark Meadows
trump, Thank you Mark
trump, Also a friend of mine who's been with us from the beginning, he's not a politician but he might as well be one
trump, He loves us
trump, He loves this party and he loves your state, lives here, Louis DeJoy
trump, One of the most successful people
trump, Thank you, Louis and your wife is… doing a great job Louis
trump, And a very special thanks to my son, Don Junior and Kimberly
trump, Great job
trump, Did Don Junior give a good speech I heard that
trump, They all said, He was on fire
trump, Well, he's fighting
trump, He loves this country
trump, My son loves this country
trump, My family loves this country, and two people, from your state, that the first lady, before she was first lady, she said, You know, there are two people that are unbelievable
trump, You've got to watch them
trump, I said, I'm not interested
trump, I'm too busy
trump, No, no, no
trump, You have to watch them
trump, They're so great, they're so smart
trump, They love the country, they love you
trump, Diamond and Silk
trump, They are incredible
trump, Incredible people
trump, Thank you very much
trump, Thank you, what a job, and they're doing very well I have to tell you that
trump, Our shared Republican agenda is pro-worker, pro-jobs, pro-family, pro-growth, and 100 pro-American
trump, And by the way, so is Doug Collins, and so John Ratcliffe
trump, Thank you fellows
trump, Thank you
trump, Two incredible fighters also
trump, For decades our leaders put global interest and special interest ahead of your interest
trump, You know that better than anybody, and this state knows it better than anybody
trump, They traded away your factories, sold your future, squandered your tax dollars, sacrificed your security, and bogged us down in one foreign debacle after another
trump, But all of that is changed
trump, We're respected again
trump, They're all saying, Oh, gee
trump, I hope he doesn't do this or that
trump, They've taken advantage of us for years, and I have to say sadly, in many cases it's our allies that took the greatest advantage of this country
trump, But now you finally have a president who understands that I'm not supposed to be the president of the world, I'm supposed to be the President of the United States of America
trump, To bring back our jobs for other countries, we passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history
trump, We've cut a record number of job killing regulations
trump, No president, no longer how long they serve, has gotten anywhere even close to what we've done with regulations, and that's one of the reasons our economy is so good
trump, And we have tremendous potential upward, and China wants to talk
trump, They want to talk
trump, China's lost three million jobs, thousands of companies are leaving China, the supply chain is crumbling because they can't pay the tariffs, and our country has taken over things that you would've never thought
trump, As an example, hundreds of billions of dollars have been and are coming into our country in the form of tariffs, and China is eating the cost, which the fake news doesn't want to tell you
trump, And out of the tens of billions of dollars that we've taken in, because of the fact that our great American patriot farmers have been targeted by China, they've been targeted, because they know the farmer is like Trump
trump, I love the farmers
trump, So they targeted the farmers, and I said to Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny, how much was it, last year and the year before Tell me
trump, It was 12 billion and it was 16 billion, and out of the tariffs that we've taken in, we gave to our farmers for distribution, hopefully very good distribution, hopefully very even distribution, we've given them 28 billion so that they're whole
trump, So that they're whole
trump, Nobody would ever do that
trump, Nobody would ever do that, I can tell you that right now, and our farmers know we have to fight
trump, I see it all the time, where some of the networks that are crazy, they have a group of farmers, in some cases they have groups of women, they say, What do you think of President Trump We like him a lot
trump, We're with him all the way
trump, And they want to turn off the cameras
trump, They go crazy, but with the farmers you know that
trump, You ever see that The 10 women
trump, What do you think of President Trump We love him Boy would I like to put you on television, I'll tell you right now, and they can't turn off those cameras fast enough, but they say to the farmers, You voted for President Trump, are you happy And ever one of them said, He did things that no ones ever done before
trump, Who would think of getting 12 billion plus 16 million, 28 billion, because they've been targeted
trump, That's the amount I asked Sonny, I said Sonny, What's the amount they've took our of our farmers It was 16 billion and the year before 12
trump, And said Sonny, We got to make that up, and we made that up
trump, Who would do that Nobody would do that
trump, First of all, nobody else ever had tens of billions of dollars pouring in from China because it's always been the other way around
trump, China has taken advantage of our country for decades, decades
trump, And I guarantee you one thing, none of these Democrats, whether it's Pocahontas or Sleepy Joe, none of them would be able to do a thing about it, and nobody would ever think of helping the farmers who have been targeted by China
trump, China made 500 billion over the last number of years, on a yearly basis, they steal our intellectual property
trump, So many other things
trump, So now it's just different, and now it's working the other way, and tariffs are a beautiful thing when you know how to use them, they're a beautiful thing
trump, And I want China to do well, and I hope they do well, but they've had now the worst year in 57 years
trump, I wonder why I wonder why And hopefully it'll all work out
trump, We'll see
trump, We're going to be talking next week
trump, We're talking now
trump, They're going to be coming to the United States in two or three weeks, and we'll see what happens, but unless we're going to make a good deal or a fair deal for our country, let's face it, we can not go back to a situation
trump, We're giving hundreds of billions of dollars to China becomes standard fare
trump, Not going to happen, we can't do it, and we have many other countries also, but we'll worry about them a little bit later
trump, Plenty of others, they've taken advantage of our country like you wouldn't believe, and I've been saying this for many years
trump, I was saying this when I was a private citizen
trump, They take our jobs, they make our product, they sell the product into our country with no tax, no nothing
trump, So we end up with closed factories, no jobs, no taxes, no nothing, and these other countries gain
trump, As an example, Mexico, I must say they've really helped us at the border
trump, The Democrats will not doing anything about these horrible open loopholes, which would be so good
trump, So we're doing it a different way, and Mexico is now patrolling with 27,000 troops
trump, They've never had two troops steward our border, and you saw the numbers today were down approximately 57
trump, But our country could fix it so easy if the Democrats would sit with me for 15 minutes, but they don't want to do that because they want to have open borders
trump, They want to have drugs pouring into our country
trump, You have to have a wall and you have to stop it, and when you look at what's happening with human trafficking, and it's mostly women, they traffic in women and they pour through our borders
trump, Well, every inch of wall that we put up is vital and we're putting up miles and miles, and we intend by next year, at the end of the year, to have anywhere between 400 and 500 miles of wall built, and this is serious wall
trump, This is the real deal
trump, Serious wall
trump, And I want to thank our new Secretary of Defense, Mark Esper, for the job he's done and he views it really as a national security threat, and you have to
trump, What can be much more threatening that people that want to pour across our borders, and we have the worst walls, we have the weakest walls in the history of any country You can't do anything to stop them
trump, You have program, catch and release
trump, You catch them and then you have to release them, and they're suppose to come back to court in the next three, four, fix, six years, and nobody shows up, and Democrats don't want to fix it
trump, So we're stopping them, so we don't even have to worry about court
trump, We ended the last administrations cruel war on American energy
trump, The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world
trump, And for all of these crazy people, but they're not so crazy, they know what they're doing, that talk about Russia, Russia, Russia
trump, Russia's not too happy about that
trump, Their primary source of income is oil and gas, and now we're bigger than Russia, bigger than Saudi Arabia
trump, We're bigger than everybody, and we're doing great
trump, So they're not exactly happy
trump, The Russian Hoax, was a pure hoax, you saw that with Comey the other day
trump, Yet every leading Democrat running for president pledges to ban the energy that drives our economy, and wage an under… If you look at what's going on your way of life is under assault by these people
trump, I mean, I go out and sometimes I'll get these huge audiences, and I wish we could've gotten a large arena than this
trump, We tried
trump, I was even willing to stand out in the rain and get my hair soaking wet, but they said it was a little bit out of your district, and I said, I don't know if it looks good being out of your district
trump, But I was willing to do it, I would've taken it
trump, I would have been very proud to have done it
trump, It would've shown it's my real hair at least
trump, It wouldn't be pretty, but it's my hair
trump, May not be great, but I will say it's better than most of my friends who are the same age
trump, A lot better
trump, A lot But we had a different location, as you all know, and we said, Let's do this one
trump, It's bigger
trump, And we put screens outside for all of the people
trump, We have screens and loud speakers and everything
trump, It's really amazing what's going on out there, but after years of building up there countries, we are finally building up our country, that's the bottom line
trump, The last administration, with Biden and Obama at the helm, they tried to ram through one of the worst trade deals that ever been negotiated, the Transpacific Partnership
trump, You could've kissed many of your industries goodbye
trump, TPP would've gutted the American auto industry
trump, It would've been even worse than NAFTA, and we know how bad NAFTA was
trump, All you have to do, is even to this day, look around at all those empty plants where people moved down and companies moved down to Mexico
trump, Not under the USMCA
trump, We got to get Nancy Pelosi to put it in for a vote, make it bipartisan
trump, She'll have tremendous Democrat support
trump, The farmers want it, the unions want it, the manufacturers want it, and by the way, 600,000 manufacturing jobs in this country, remember You would need a magic wand
trump, You can't do that anymore
trump, Well, we did it, but we've got to get USMCA put up for a vote by the Democrats
trump, But in my first week in office I proudly withdrew from that job destroying TPP catastrophe, and we're replacing one of the worst trade deals ever made by any country
trump, You can go back as far as you want, NAFTA, the disaster of NAFTA
trump, So whatever you do, start talking to your people, we need a vote on the USMCA
trump, That's United States, Mexico, and Canada, and they've already voted
trump, They want it and we want it, and it's great for the farmers
trump, It's great for everybody
trump, We're also aggressively combating a problem that you have in North Carolina, problem that we have in almost all states, the opioid epidemic
trump, Last year we saw the first nationwide decline in drug overdose deaths in nearly 31 years
trump, At the center of the American drug crisis is the border crisis
trump, Criminal cartel smuggle vast quantities of lethal narcotics across our souther border, including heroin, meth, cocaine, and fentanyl
trump, 100,000 people a year die from what comes across our souther border, and we can get the Democrats to help us in sealing it even tighter
trump, We got to get them
trump, We got to get them
trump, We got to get them
trump, So if you want to stop the drug smugglers, the human traffickers, the viscous MS13 gang members, and by the way thank you to ICE
trump, These people go into those nests, we call them nets
trump, These are vicious, vicious people
trump, We got into the nests with our ICE people, and for them it's another day at the office
trump, There aren't too many people in this room that want to do it for a living
trump, Let me see
trump, That guy would
trump, Maybe him, maybe her, right Maybe her
trump, But it's a rough job and they get so little praise for the job that they do
trump, So dangerous
trump, These are many killers in those gangs, and we're taking them out of our country by the thousands, MS13
trump, And as you know, Democrats even want to give free healthcare to illegal immigrants
trump, As long as I'm your president I will never, ever let Democrats take away your healthcare, and give it away free to people that have entered our country illegally
trump, We can't do that
trump, It's a tremendous incentive to come in
trump, Democrats also want to bring in unlimited numbers of foreign refugees from overseas, all at the expense of supporting their own communities
trump, Republicans, no matter what you do, where you are, we want people to obey our laws
trump, You want people that are going to help our country
trump, The Democrat party has never been farther outside of the mainstream
trump, Every major Democrat running for president supports a massive government takeover of healthcare that would raid Medicare, force private doctors out of medicine, and lead to the rationing of life saving treatments
trump, And they want to take away your private healthcare, your private insurance
trump, 180 million people will lose with what they want to do
trump, It's a disaster
trump, It's like, did you ever really feel where you don't even have to treat people nicely You don't have any choice, you have to vote for me
trump, I can leave right now
trump, I can say, North Carolina, I've had it with you
trump, I'm leaving right now
trump, And you know what You got to go out and vote
trump, What are you going to do Put one of these crazy people running our country again But it's never been so far left
trump, I told a story the other day about a business man I saw, one of the biggest in the country
trump, You probably know his name
trump, He's hated me for 20 years, and I've hated him also
trump, Okay Now they're going to go out tomorrow, Breaking news, Donald Trump hates people
trump, You're sort of right about that
trump, I never liked this guy, and I see him in the White House, and I say, What are you doing here And he goes, Mr
trump, President
trump, See now he calls me Mr
trump, President
trump, He used to call me something else
trump, Mr
trump, President, I'm fighting for your victory
trump, I said, You got to be kidding
trump, He goes, Honestly, you're doing a great job, but also if this radical left gets in they're going to take away everything, and they're going to destroy our country
trump, And for the first time I like this guy
trump, My administration is defending your right to choose the plan and the doctor that is best for you
trump, Remember President Obama 28 times, remember 28 times, they counted them and there's much more than that I would imagine, that you can choose your plan, you can choose your doctor
trump, It didn't work out that way, did it Obamacare, and we're keeping Obamacare alive
trump, We got rid of the individual mandate, the worst part of Obamacare
trump, We're keeping it and running it as well as it can, but the premiums are too high
trump, The deductibles are through the roof
trump, It's ridiculous, and we're coming up with Lindsey Graham and all of the folks, we're coming up with a great healthcare plan that if we take back to the house
trump, That's why Dan and Greg, if we take back the House, if we keep the Senate, and maybe even increase it a little bit, wouldn't be bad, and on the assumption we keep the presidency, you're going to have great healthcare
trump, Thank you
trump, We almost had it
trump, We had a man campaigning for eight years to knock out Obamacare, and when he voted it didn't work out that way, did it We had it, and we would have had it, but we're going to end up actually with a better plan
trump, Sometimes through adversity things work out better
trump, We're going to end up with a better plan, you watch
trump, We'll always protect patients with pre-existing conditions also
trump, Always, yep, my word
trump, Our ambitious campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs has produced the largest decline in drug prices in more than 51 years
trump, Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion
trump, Ripping babies straight from the mother's womb, right up to the moment of birth, and if you look at the governor of Virginia, he was even talking about essentially you would say an execution
trump, He was talking after the baby is born, the doctor will talk to the mother and they'll make the decision as to whether or not that baby lives
trump, This is a radical Democrat idea
trump, That's why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion, because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God
trump, Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, and socialism
trump, They're socialists
trump, The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, and the American dream
trump, Every day they're making good on the motto, Promise made, promises kept
trump, In fact, we are keeping even more promises by far than we made, or than we promised
trump, So many more
trump, So many more
trump, So many more
trump, You know what we did with respect to people that are very sick or terminally ill, right Right to try it's called
trump, I love that name
trump, Right to try
trump, We have some of the greatest doctors in the world, labs in the world, hospitals in the world, and we have incredible medicine that's prohibited from being used until it gets approval, and sometimes that approval can take many years
trump, And I said, Wait a minute, if a person is sick…  And they've been trying to get this for 45 years
trump, I said, If a person is sick, and maybe terminally ill, why aren't we letting them try this new technology And so many things are happening, and we did Right to Try
trump, And it wasn't easy, but I was helped by Lindsey and a lot of great people
trump, A lot of great people
trump, All of them helped
trump, Mark helped so much
trump, All of them help
trump, Rick
trump, We have had a tremendous success
trump, We had so many people wanting to help, but it was complicated believe it not because the country didn't want the liability
trump, I said, You know what you do You draw up an agreement taking away liability
trump, They said, That's a good idea
trump, The insurance companies and the drug companies were very unsure
trump, This has been going on for many years
trump, I got it done
trump, The results have been unbelievable
trump, Right to Try
trump, Things that we've never even talked about we're getting done
trump, Maybe one of the biggest things is within about a month, we'll have close to 180 federal judges, including the public division judges
trump, Including two great new Supreme Court Justices
trump, Justice Neil Gorsuch, and Justice Brett Cavanaugh, who they put through hell
trump, We passed something that they've wanted to do for half a century
trump, We passed VA Choice
trump, So when your great and honored veterans are waiting in line for three weeks, four weeks, five days, 10 days, two months, they go to a private doctor, we pay for the bill, and they get themselves taken care of, instead of dying, which was happening
trump, And we also passed VA Accountability on behalf of our great veterans
trump, That means when they treat our veterans, and they wouldn't have done it in primetime I can tell you, but when they treat our sick and trouble veterans badly we can say, You're fired
trump, Get the heck out
trump, It's called VA Accountability
trump, That's another one we've been trying, and in all fairness the unions made it very tough
trump, Civil service made it almost impossible
trump, Everyone said, You're never going to get it done
trump, We got it done
trump, We want to thank the Republican Senate
trump, I want to thank some incredible people in the House of Representatives, and Kevin I want to thank you… … people in the House of Representatives
trump, And Kevin, I want to thank you because that was a great job you did on that one
trump, That was a great job, thank you, Kevin McCarthy
trump, We've received record funding for the US military, 700 billion last year, 716 billion dollars this year, 738 billion dollars … And you know, know I'm a big believer in budgets but we have no choice
trump, We had to rebuild our military with all that's going on today with China, with Russia, with radical Islam, with everything that's happening, we had to do something
trump, And you know, budgets are fine, I love budgets and we will get to that, don't worry about it
trump, But we had to rebuild, our military was totally depleted, it was totally depleted
trump, We have beautiful new F-35's, F-18's, new ships, new missiles, new rockets, we have new everything
trump, I came back with Admiral Brown, the United States Coast Guard and some of the other folks, and they were saying that the new Coast Guard cutters … How good a job has the Coast Guard done during these hurricanes And I said, Admiral, how good are the new Coast Guard cutters He said, They're the finest in the world, sir
trump, And they had old broken equipment that they had to keep going on a shoestring
trump, They have brand new Coast Guard cutters
trump, We had to do it, we had to do it
trump, There's always time for the other but we had to do it
trump, We've rebuilt our military, we've taken care of the great people that work in our military
trump, We gave them a raise, a beautiful raise they were so entitled to
trump, And I also got other NATO members to pay an additional 100 billion dollars over the last year and a half that they weren't paying, they were delinquent
trump, We're supposed to protect them and they don't pay, I say you can't do that
trump, You can't do that, you got to pay, NATO
trump, Now we're finally making immensely wealthy countries pay the cost of their defense, we're negotiating with a lot of them
trump, Think of it, we have these immensely wealthy countries and they're paying for a fraction of our cost to defend them
trump, How did that happen And do you know what the biggest excuse is when I go to them and I'll say, King, you got to pay, or, Mr
trump, Prime minister, you got to pay, or, Mr
trump, President, you've got to pay, you know It's costing us billions of dollars to protect these wealthy
trump, You know what their biggest thing is Because I can't understand how we did this for so many years, decades, decades … You have been defending all of … I won't mention names because I don't want to embarrass anybody
trump, I don't want to, forget it, some of the wealthiest countries in the world
trump, And when I say, King, President, Prime Minister, Queen, no matter what I say, you know what they say But nobody's ever asked us to do that before, that's the only excuse
trump, Because I say to them, Why would we do this Why are we defending you You're immensely wealthy, you compete with us on trade
trump, We have lousy trade deals that we are renegotiating many of them and ultimately all of them
trump, Why are we protecting you, Mr
trump, President Well, I don't know, I don't know
trump, But you know what their answer is Because you've always done it
trump, That's not a great answer
trump, So we're taking in billions and billions but I've got 100 billion dollars and the Secretary General of NATO, Stoltenberg, is my biggest fan
trump, He said, Until President Trump, you had to see the data across the spending was going like this
trump, And ours was going like this, we were defending many countries that treat us very badly on trade and very unfairly
trump, We were defending them and now it's changing, around 100 billion dollars, they're not happy
trump, And then I read where Obama is more popular in Germany than Trump
trump, He's got to be, I'm making people pay their bills, he's got to be
trump, You know, the day that I'm more popular than him, I'm not doing my job
trump, The big story, they like him more in Europe than they like Trump
trump, I think they should
trump, 100 billion dollars more they're paying
trump, To protect America's security, I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran Nuclear Deal
trump, We paid them 150 billion dollars for that piece of work
trump, I withdrew it and we put sanctions all over the place and they're a much different country and let's see what happens
trump, But I can tell you they'd like to get back to business because they're not doing very well
trump, When I came into office, Iran was a real terror
trump, 18 sites of confliction, they were behind every one of them in the Middle East
trump, And who knows, could have been elsewhere
trump, And I said we're not going to do it, 150 billion dollars President Obama paid and 1
trump,8 billion in cash
trump, Whoever saw a million dollars piled up as a promotion In hundred dollar bills, it's a lot
trump, Now take a million dollars and make it 1
trump,8 billion dollars in cash
trump, I'm actually more impressed with that number than 150 billion dollars, you want to know the truth
trump, 1
trump,8 billion dollars in cash and we got taken to the cleaners so I terminated the deal
trump, And I recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem which every president said they would do
trump, And I also approved for Israel the Golan Heights and if you really think about it, I said to people, What's more important, the Golan Heights or the capital of Jerusalem by moving our embassy there He said, Neither, sir
trump, What you've done in Iran is more important than both of them
trump, I said, You know, I guess you're right when you think about it
trump, So we've done a good job, all of us together, as a movement we've done a great job for Israel
trump, For years, you watched as your politicians apologized for America
trump, Now you have a president who is standing up for america and we are standing up for the people of North Carolina
trump, You must never forget that the 2020 election is about one thing thing, you
trump, It's true, it's not about me, it's about you
trump, It's about your family, your future and the fate of your country
trump, That's what we did in 2016, they came from the hills and valleys, they came from the cities, they came from all over the place and people were saying, these fakers back there, they were saying, What the hell is happening But I knew it was going to happen because we go out and we see these rallies, the likes of which no one has ever seen before ever, ever, ever in politics, ever in politics
trump, A vote for any Democrat in 2020 and a vote for any Democrat tomorrow in North Carolina is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and a destruction of the American dream
trump, We are entering this campaign with the best record, the best results, the best agenda and the only positive vision for the people of North Carolina
trump, And I've said it and I say it loudly and proudly, I don't believe there's been any president or any administration that has done more in 2
trump,5 years then we have as a group in America
trump, When you add it all up, nobody's done what we have
trump, Our first task is a giant victory
trump, Tomorrow, right here in the great state of North Carolina with your support, tomorrow we take the first steps to firing Speaker Pelosi and winning back the House in 2020
trump, We need everybody to get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors and get out and vote for Dan Bishop and get out and vote for Greg Murphy, you got to get out tomorrow and vote
trump, Together we will lift millions more from our horrible, horrible situations that have developed over the years
trump, Look at what's happening to Democrat-run cities, every single one of them
trump, We are going to lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity
trump, With your help, we will elect for Republicans to Congress to create a safe, modern, fair and lawful system of immigration
trump, We will enact great deals that result in more products probably stamped with the four beautiful words made in the USA, made in the USA
trump, You want made in America, I don't care, what do you like better Made in america or made in the USA Go ahead
trump, Wait, ready You want made in America then made in the USA
trump, What do you like better, made in America, made in the USA Okay, I think we know that answer
trump, So in 2016 we had in my opinion the greatest phrase in the history of politics, make America great again
trump, Now we are within moments hopefully of having, despite what you heard a few weeks ago, where we were heading
trump, And they're going, Please, please let there be a recession, please
trump, They're willing to give up their results because they think it will help them win the election
trump, They're not going to win the election
trump, Don't forget, we are doing this and still fighting the unfairness of China and other countries on trade
trump, What happens when that gets fixed and other things get fixed We're setting new records and we're fighting trade deals and we're fighting military deals that are unfair to our country
trump, Think what happens when it all gets fixed, We have ourselves a country that's going to be so strong
trump, But we had a phrase, make what Make America great again, the best
trump, I think it was maybe the greatest, 2016, but we've done a lot and now they're very close to setting a new … I think it's the 118th time that we will have set a new record with the stock market, right Many, many times, many, many times
trump, I can't be certain that many but it's a lot, okay I always have to preface it because there'll be headlines, Trump didn't tell the truth
trump, So I've always got to be extremely cautious
trump, We had the greatest phrase of all time and even the fake news media would agree, make America great again, MAGA country, make America great again
trump, Now we still have a year and a half, little bit less, can you believe it Can you believe it I stood in the White House with the first lady that first night and I said, Wow, look at this
trump, That's the bedroom of Abraham Lincoln, you have to see this
trump, It's so perfectly done, it's so the way it was
trump, We announced it in front of the press and in 2026
trump, And I said, Well, wait a minute, under the normal rules I will be out in 2024 so we may have to go for an extra term
trump, Oh, they're going crazy
trump, Tomorrow, you will see headlines, Trump wants an extra term, I told you, I told you
trump, He wants an extra term, ladies and gentlemen
trump, We told you, we told you he's a dictator, we told you
trump, No, no, I'm only kidding, I'm only kidding
trump, But we actually have the World Cup, it's the biggest sporting event in the world and we got it
trump, And that's where we're working it also with Mexico and Canada to give them some of the games
trump, We've got a great relationship with the World Cup, it's a big deal
trump, Bob Kraft helped me with the New England Patriots people
trump, Tom Brady had a pretty good game the other night, right They have a good a coach, whether you like it or not, and I know you, North Carolina
trump, But how good a coach, in all fairness here, is Coach Belichick How good is he I know you want to be cool but he's pretty good
trump, We have to appreciate genius, we all like genius
trump, But we are going to achieve new breakthroughs in science, medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending within 10 years the AIDS epidemic in America
trump, That's shocking to hear that but we can do it, we're going to do it, definitely
trump, Incredible, the strides that we have made
trump, We will defeat the Democrats to drive up the cost of houses, cars, healthcare and education by liberating Americans from their analysts' push for a job killing, soul crushing Washington regulations
trump, As an example, we're trying to get the car companies, going to give them a little bit of extra energy and they will be able to build a car that consumers can buy which will be better than the car they make today
trump, And you'll save 3,500 dollars, think of that
trump, It will be safer, it will be better, you can save 3,500 dollars, it will be less costly
trump, And we're going to try to get that done
trump, And then they were forcing you to buy light bulbs that cost a fortune, so I signed something a couple days ago that gives you the right to continue to use the incandescent light bulbs, I don't know about you, much less expensive lights that are beaming down over us
trump, But you know, somebody told me that as you know, they're much more expensive bulbs than for what you save
trump, But they said that if the bulb break, it's considered almost like the waste site
trump, It's very big, the bulbs, the new bulbs, they're very dangerous with all of the gases
trump, And I said, What's the point Well, then he said, Well, I'm saying if we continue that production, they can buy whatever they want to buy but it can really save a tremendous amount of money and even have a light that's better
trump, And there is a big danger, in fact they have labels, don't break this bulb
trump, What do you do, you're going to throw it away I promise I won't break it, all the new ones
trump, So you can hopefully buy the new ones but you can buy the old ones too and you can save a lot of money and you could even look better
trump, We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms
trump, Above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one America, we'll be one united nation
trump, We'll support, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States
trump, We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement, thank you, law enforcement
trump, We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life
trump, We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way like you
trump, We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag
trump, And we will live by the words of our national motto, in God we trust, it'll stay there
trump, We stand on the shoulders of American patriots who crossed the ocean, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, revolutionized industry, pioneered science, won two world wars wars, defeated fascism and communism, put a man on the moon and built the most exceptional country in the history of the world
trump, We are great Americans and the future belongs to us
trump, The future belongs to you
trump, With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting and I'd like to fight a little less with these people but they just don't stop
trump, They just keep coming at you in waves
trump, They are unfortunately not the best people
trump, And we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning, we're going to keep on winning
trump, We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God
trump, America is thriving like never before, we may have right now the greatest economy in the history of our nation
trump, And ladies and gentlemen of North Carolina, the best is yet to come
trump, Together we will make America wealthy again
trump, We will make America strong again, we will
trump, We will make America safe again
trump, And we will make America great again
trump, Thank you, everybody
trump, Thank you, North Carolina
trump, Thank you
trump,
trump,We brought you a lot of car plants, Michigan
trump, We brought you a lot of car plants
trump, You know that, right Long time, it's been a long time since you had all these plants being built, but we brought you a lot over the last three and a half years, and we're going to bring you a lot more
trump, That's happening
trump, Hello, Michigan and I'm thrilled to be in Freeland with thousands of loyal, hardworking American patriots
trump, Fifty-four days from now, we're going to win Michigan, and we're going to win four more years in the White House
trump, This is the most important election in the history of our country
trump, Joe Biden devoted his career to offshoring Michigan's jobs, outsourcing- We shouldn't be smiling about it, but we've changed it around
trump, Outsourcing Michigan's factories, throwing open your borders, dragging us into endless foreign wars and surrendering our children's future to China and other far away lands
trump, Biden supported every disastrous globalist sellout for over a half a century, including NAFTA, China, and DPP
trump, You know that
trump, Joe Biden surrendered your jobs to China and now he wants to surrender our country to the violent left wing mob and you're seeing that every night
trump, If Biden wins, China wins
trump, If Biden wins, the mob wins
trump, If Biden wins, the rioters, anarchist, arsonist and flag burners win
trump, But I wouldn't worry about it because he's not winning
trump, I don't think he's winning
trump, This is not the crowd of a person who comes in second place
trump, You do know that
trump, The same thing happened four years ago
trump, It was election eve but by the time I got here, it was late
trump, Some of you are in that audience at one o'clock in the morning now election day
trump, We had 32,000 people show up and the reason I went is that I heard that crooked Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton and Barack Hussein Obama were traveling to Michigan because they heard they had problems
trump, They were supposed to win Michigan, but they did such a lousy job that they had to come and get some votes
trump, They came and I heard about it
trump, They said, Sir, could you do it I hopped in the plane
trump, We landed at 12 o'clock in the evening
trump, I started speaking at one o'clock in the morning now election day
trump, 32,000 people
trump, She had 500 people
trump, I said, Why are we going to lose Michigan And we didn't
trump, And we didn't
trump, First time in a long time, but now we're up in the polls
trump, We just saw polls
trump, We're up in Michigan
trump, I don't know if that's good or bad
trump, I don't know
trump, I don't know if that's good or bad because in all those polls where we were down last time, we won
trump, So maybe we're better off being down a little bit
trump, Hello, John James
trump, I see you handsome guy
trump, John James, get out and vote for John
trump, I'm going to introduce you in a second John James
trump, What a job you've done
trump, I have to tell you, he took, I saw this group of people that were running, all nice people, three very rich people and one guy that was John James and I saw them all
trump, Right I saw them all and I said, Wait
trump, With the wonderful invention of TiVo, one of the greats, you can play it back
trump, I said, Who was that He said, I don't know, sir
trump, I said, Play it back
trump, I said, That man is going to be a star
trump, It was John James
trump, That was in the Republican primary
trump, After learning about him with his incredible career and helicopter, and he's a great, and actually a great flyer I heard the other day, a great one, a really good one as opposed to those that aren't so good, but his incredible background and education at West Point and all of the things he did
trump, I said, This guy and I endorsed him and he went like a rocket ship
trump, Frankly, if he had a little more support, he would have won the last time
trump, This time, I hear you're even, and maybe even ahead, and we're going to win with John James
trump, He's a great guy, but I'm going to introduce him in a second
trump, I'm running for reelection to keep jobs in Michigan
trump, We have got a lot of … Last year before the China plague came in, we have the China plague
trump, Thank you China very much
trump, Should have never let that happen
trump, They should have never, ever let it happen
trump, They stopped it from going into China, but they didn't stop it from coming out here and coming into the US, in Europe and the rest of the world, 188 countries
trump, But it is what it is and we're not happy about it and we're going to remember it
trump, We're going to remember it, but we had in Michigan and in the country, the greatest economy in the history of the world, there has never been an economy
trump, Now, we're building it again and it's being built fast
trump, By the way, it's turning out to be John, a super V
trump, No more V
trump, Now it's starting out to be a super V, but to put violent criminals behind bars and to ensure the future belongs to America, not to China, because if we win, America wins and that's what it's about
trump, If we win, America wins
trump, Not only does Joe Biden want to eliminate your jobs, he wants to eliminate your borders
trump, He's promised to flood your state with refugees
trump, You know that as well as I do
trump, You see it all the time
trump, From terrorist hotspots around the world, including Syria, Somalia, and Yemen, Biden's pledged to have a 700 increase
trump, He made this deal with crazy Bernie, a 700 increase in the flow of refugees
trump, So, he wants to lift it up by 700
trump, This is in their manifesto
trump, He's also pledged to terminate all national security travel bans, overwhelming your state with poorly vetted migrants from jihadist regions
trump, Making matters worse, he would open the flood gates in the middle of a pandemic
trump, By the way, the wall, it's over 311 miles long right now doing very well
trump, Doing very well
trump, Make the mic louder, the mic louder
trump, Biden is waging war against the American middle class
trump, I think most of you are not middle class
trump, You're upper class
trump, You're the elite
trump, You know the way they talk about the elite, the elite, they're really elite
trump, I see them
trump, They're not elite
trump, You're the elite
trump, The elite has decided
trump, Boy, have we hurt the elite, haven't we now You're the super elite
trump, The left wants to get rid of me so they can come after you
trump, It's very simple
trump, Over the last three and a half years, we've secured America's borders, blocked the entry of foreign terrorist, fixed our disastrous trade deals and we have fixed our trade deals good
trump, They are good
trump, In fact, Biden was interviewed today on … There they are
trump, CNN
trump, No, he was just interviewed today
trump, He was interviewed by Jake Tapper who I find to be a nice guy
trump, I don't think he likes me too much, but that's okay
trump, He was interviewed on CNN and they said, Which is better, NAFTA or the USMCA He said, No, no, the USMCA
trump, Tapper goes, What Couldn't believe it
trump, He said USMCA
trump, He made a mistake
trump, From his perspective, he made a mistake because he doesn't know what's going on
trump, Even though he's right, he doesn't know
trump, There were a little surprised to hear that
trump, They gave him a few chances
trump, Let's ask that question again, but we brought back our manufacturing jobs
trump, We rebuilt the awesome power of the US military
trump, We obliterated the ISIS caliphate and built the greatest economy in the history of the world
trump, Now, we are doing it again bigger and better than ever before
trump, Before the end of the year, we will have a safe and effective vaccine and we will defeat the China virus
trump, I have a feeling … By the way, I think the vaccine is going to come very soon, going to come very soon
trump, With it or without it, we're rounding the turn
trump, You see what's happening
trump, You see the numbers are plunging
trump, You see how good we're doing relative to other countries and other parts of the world, but the fake news doesn't like saying that
trump, They don't like telling you that
trump, Next year, unless you have somebody that's going to quadruple your taxes, raise your taxes, raise up all of those regulations that we cut, next year will be one of the greatest years of the history of our country
trump, At no time before has there been a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, and two agendas for the future
trump, There's never been a vision like this
trump, You have sleepy Joe and you have Trump
trump, Sleepy Joe, he's a beauty
trump, He's a beauty
trump, He's a beauty
trump, I watched the Democrat debates, right I watched them up there and he was so bad
trump, I said, There's no way he makes it
trump, It's sad, isn't it The first lady actually came in and one time she watched it and she goes, and she's a nice person
trump, She meant this really, me, I view it differently
trump, But she looked at, she watched the debate and she watched Joe and she said, Darling, it's so sad
trump, This was early on
trump, This is the guy I'm running against
trump, It's so sad
trump, Darling, it's so sad
trump, But we got them
trump, Joe Biden has put forward the most extreme platform and it's not him
trump, He doesn't know what platform
trump, He doesn't
trump, It's your radical left people
trump, It's AOC plus three
trump, It's all these people
trump, Bernie
trump, It's Bernie
trump, It's Kamala, the most liberal person in the US Senate
trump, I tell it all the time
trump, She started off her poll numbers at 15, 14, 12, 12
trump, Then she went back up to 12 and a half
trump, Then there was a big plunge right down to the bottom and then she dropped out
trump, She dropped out, but there's never been anything like this
trump, No major party has ever had a candidate that's so extreme in his views
trump, Again, he took the manifesto drawn up by Bernie and the super lips and that's what he's going by, including a massive increase in your taxes and a total assault on your second amendment
trump, On November 3rd, Michigan, you better vote for me
trump, I got you so many damn car plants
trump, I'll tell you what, I'll be so angry at you
trump, I got you a lot of plants
trump, Is that right I mean, have you seen how we're doing here All the plants that have been built, are being built and what about the plants that are being expanded They don't want to give you credit for that
trump, They just expanded
trump, I went to Prime Minister Abe of Japan
trump, I say, Prime Minister, you have to start doing something
trump, He's a great guy
trump, He'll be retiring soon
trump, He's a great guy, the prime minister of Japan, Abe
trump, I say, Shinzō, Shinzō, you have to do me a favor
trump, You've got to send car plants over here
trump, You're sending all those cars
trump, We stupidly don't
trump, Now they've been building it for a number of years, but you hadn't had a plan built in like 42 years
trump, They were the old plants
trump, And it's been amazing what's happened in Michigan
trump, But honestly, it's been amazing what's happened in Ohio and North Carolina and South Carolina and Florida and New Hampshire and so many other places
trump, Our country is doing great
trump, We had to take a pause to get rid of the China virus, and we got rid … We're coming around
trump, We're coming around that turn
trump, I'm telling you, you watch, next year, better than last year
trump, It's going to be better than last year
trump, Michigan will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity, or whether we'll allow Sleepy Joe to impose 4 trillion in tax hikes, ban American energy, confiscate your guns, shut down the economy, and tell your governor to open up your state
trump, It's all Democrat governors
trump, And I think they do it for political reasons because there'll be less activity
trump, You'd be doing even better if you had a governor that knew what the hell she was doing
trump, You got to open it up the state
trump, And also, you have to have a governor because right now Michigan's lagging
trump, Great football, great coach, great team
trump, We want a governor, John James, that's going to let Michigan play Big Ten football this year
trump, You've been seeing a lot of the other schools want to open Big Ten at my suggestion
trump, How about Sleepy Joe He said, Donald Trump is against football
trump, No, no, no
trump, I'm the one that says open it up, let's play football
trump, These people practice disinformation like nobody has ever practiced it
trump, They're liars
trump, I'll tell you, they lie
trump, But we have a good chance
trump, You have a very good commissioner, and the commissioner is working hard, and hopefully, very soon they'll say you're going to play football
trump, And I hope they're not leaving Michigan out because it's never the same if they do
trump, But you have Maryland, where they have a problem in terms of playing
trump, And the governors have a lot of power over that
trump, They have a lot of power, a lot of say
trump, So let's play Big Ten football, right They want to shut down auto production, delay the vaccine
trump, They want to destroy your suburbs
trump, Look at what I've done for your suburbs
trump, You know what I've done
trump, You know what I've done
trump, Does anybody want to have somebody from Antifa as a member and as a resident of your suburb I don't think so too much
trump, Say, Darling, who moved in next door Oh, it's a resident of Antifa
trump, No, thank you
trump, Let's get out of here
trump, Let's get the hell out of here, darling
trump, Let's leave our suburbs
trump, I wish Trump were president
trump, He wouldn't have allowed that to happen
trump, And that's exactly right, I won't allow it to happen
trump, The suburbs are the American dream, and I will tell you, I have protected your suburbs
trump, I got rid of a regulation that played with your zoning and played with other things, where they force projects into the suburbs of our great country
trump, And I got rid of it
trump, They said, Sir, we can amend it and make it less crazy
trump, I said, No, I don't want to amend it
trump, I don't want to do that
trump, I want to get rid of it
trump, Well, sir, why don't we just do a simple amendment It would be … I said, I want to get rid of it
trump, End it
trump, And we ended it
trump, We ended it
trump, I think the people living in the suburbs … which I know very well
trump, I watched Westchester in New York where they were doing things that should never have been done, and it's not going to happen to our suburbs
trump, They want to erase your borders and indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-American lies in our schools
trump, Not going to happen
trump, Not going to happen
trump, For the last four years, they've tried everything to stop us, and they are only getting more desperate by the day
trump, Can you imagine if on September 3rd, they say, Ladies and gentlemen, Donald Trump has been declared the winner
trump, Donald Trump has been declared … At first, they'll go crazy
trump, And then they'll say, Okay, it's time now to be reasonable
trump, They will have had it
trump, They will have had it
trump, We were coming together as a nation
trump, Very interesting
trump, Before the plague came in from China, we will coming together
trump, It was success
trump, Somebody said, What's going to bring you together And it was
trump, We were coming together
trump, I was starting to get calls from Democrats that … Frankly, we didn't speak much
trump, And I was starting to get calls, and then all of a sudden we saw the plague pour in, and we saw what was happening, and it really stopped things
trump, But success was getting very, very close to bringing us all together
trump, And then we had to say, Let's take a time out
trump, We got to fix this mess
trump, And we did, and now we're coming back strong, but success brings us together, and it was happening, and then we got that terrible situation happened, and we'll never forget it
trump, Biden and his party tried to lock law-abiding Americans into their homes while they encourage rioters and vandals rampaging through, in all cases, Democrat-run cities
trump, Republican-run cities are doing very well
trump, I hope you know that
trump, And I hope you know, like in Minneapolis, we were asked to come in, we went in, we took care of that problem in about, what, 30 minutes Unfortunately, they let almost two weeks go by
trump, And if you look at what we just did in Wisconsin, which was so amazing, three days, and we went in
trump, And by the way, the US Marshals went in to get the killer, and that was the end of that
trump, They got the killer, they got the killer
trump, You know what I'm talking about
trump, And we were going to go into Seattle
trump, The next day, we're all set, all lined up, looking forward to it
trump, We just said, We're doing it
trump, I mean, they actually took over a part of the city, and the mayor said, This is going to be a summer of love, right Where do these people come from But we were all set to go in there, heard we were going in, we informed them we're going in, and they sent their police to do it, and we never even had to go in
trump, But we can solve those problems in a matter of literally minutes
trump, Thank you
trump, Don't say that, I'll start to cry, and that wouldn't be good for my image
trump, You don't want to see me cry
trump, I'll start to cry
trump, One of the fake news broadcasters, because this happened the other day, we had a tremendous crowd like this
trump, I mean, we had a tremendous crowd in North Carolina
trump, They started chanting, We love you
trump, We love you
trump, We love you
trump, And it's incredible, they said with all the years that they've been covering presidential elections, they've never heard that chant that, We love you
trump, No, it's very nice
trump, No, they've never heard it
trump, True
trump, Now they'll say, He misrepresented
trump, 18 years ago, there was a rally held by somebody, and we heard the words from two people that, ‘We love you, sir
trump,' Now this is what we're dealing with
trump, And by the way, I look out, there's a lot of people that … Look at this
trump, There's people back there that can't even get in
trump, Thank you, Michigan
trump, Thank you
trump, It's really nice to be with you
trump, As president, I will always support the heroes of law enforcement
trump, I was very honored to receive the endorsement of the Police Officers Association of Michigan
trump, Where are they Where are they They're here someplace
trump, Where are they Thank you, fellows
trump, That's really nice
trump, I'll tell you
trump, That's an honor
trump, I have to be honest
trump, I got it from Florida, Texas, Ohio, North Carolina, South … But Michigan is Michigan
trump, Thank you
trump, I don't think there's any law enforcement officer that is against us
trump, What is our poll number 99
trump, I know they had 365,000 at one group, and they got a unanimous vote
trump, I said, That's pretty good
trump, How can you go the other way You people are fantastic, and we love you
trump, Thank you
trump, That's great
trump, Thank you very much
trump, Appreciate it
trump, Biden says he wants to protect Black lives, but his radical platform will cut short the lives of thousands of young African American citizens
trump, Thousands
trump, The murder rate in Democrat-run cities like Chicago, Baltimore, New York, so many others is higher than in Afghanistan, yet Biden supports imposing these failed policies nationwide
trump, You will have crime like you've never seen before
trump, You'll have crime like you've never seen
trump, Last week, Joe Biden proudly accepted the endorsement of the pro-criminal Portland district attorney, who has a policy of releasing rioters, criminals, and violent extremists without charge
trump, Biden's plan … And every time I say Biden's plan, it's not his plan, it's the people that tell them what they're going to do, so please understand
trump, I just don't want to say that every time I mention his name
trump, So it should say, The people that control Biden's plan is to appease domestic terrorists
trump, My plan is to arrest them, to lock them up
trump, If Joe Biden is elected, far left lunatics won't just be running failed Democrat city, they'll be running the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, and the United States Supreme Court, and we can't let that happen
trump, No city, town, or suburb will be safe
trump, On November 3rd, your vote will save America
trump, Remember, it's the most important election we've ever had
trump, I'm joined tonight by some great warriors that have really helped me a lot in Washington with the fake impeachment, the impeachment hoax, the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax
trump, Somebody said Russia's coming up again
trump, Adam Schiff said, We'd like to find out about … I said, What about China What about other countries It's always Russia
trump, Russia, Russia
trump, They're at it again
trump, I want to just thank these guys because these were real warriors for all of us
trump, They love your state, and they love our country
trump, Congressman Jack Bergman
trump, Great job, Jack
trump, John Moolenaar
trump, Thank you, John
trump, Great
trump, Great going, John
trump, He's a tough cookie
trump, And Tim Walberg
trump, Tim, thank you
trump, Great job
trump, What great people
trump, And I talked about him a little while before, I could talk about him all night
trump, He's a star
trump, He's going to be a future star
trump, We have a very much different party than we had four years ago
trump, We're now the party of the workers
trump, We're the party of a lot of different things now, but we weren't really considered the party of the workers
trump, Certainly not anymore
trump, Remember this, we're the party of Abraham Lincoln
trump, A lot of people forget that
trump, Honestly
trump, Remember when they used to say, he doesn't act presidential And I used to say, It's so easy to be presidential
trump, I'd only have about 10 or 15 people here
trump, You'd be bored
trump, But remember I used to do that But I'd always say, I can be more presidential than any president in our history, except for the possibility of Abraham Lincoln when he wears his hat
trump, Tough to beat
trump, That's tough to beat, John James
trump, But seriously, if you want to be well-represented … Your current Senator, I don't even know this guy
trump, I don't even know this guy
trump, Nobody does
trump, They don't know who he is
trump, They don't even know
trump, He comes into the office, I say, Who is that guy I know every Senator
trump, Democrat, Republican
trump, I don't know this guy
trump, I know your other Senator
trump, I can tell by her hair
trump, She's got interesting hair
trump, But that was John's first crack
trump, He learned a lot
trump, And frankly, and I mean this, if he had more support from the Republican Party, he would've won that race
trump, He would've
trump, But this guy Peters, right Peters
trump, I say, Who's Peters Nobody knows him
trump, He doesn't do anything
trump, I mean, look, we're going to end this, but I have to tell you, John James can be so great
trump, He loves our country
trump, He's been educated at the highest level
trump, He was always the top at everything he's ever done
trump, And this is what he has
trump, And I'll be honest with you, John
trump, I think I can tell this story
trump, John and I were thinking about John
trump, I was thinking about John more than myself because I know talent
trump, And I said, John, you can run for a certain House seat, right And you're guaranteed to win
trump, You can run for another House seat
trump, It'll be a tough race, but you're going to win
trump, Or you can have a tough race against somebody that nobody ever heard of
trump, It's like a habit that they press that particular trigger, but that's a tough race
trump, So you can be an absolute Congressman, or you can take a shot at this one
trump, He said, Sir, I can do more in the Senate than I can do in the House
trump, And that was his decision
trump, Right Took a lot of guts
trump, So John, I'm with you
trump, You have my total and complete endorsement
trump, You have everything I can do
trump, Everything I can do, we will do for you
trump, And I really believe you're going to make it
trump, You're running against somebody that is just ridiculous, folks
trump, It's ridiculous
trump, Don't do it
trump, Also with us are some other great candidates and people that are going to do a tremendous job, helping our Congressman
trump, Paul Junge
trump, Where's Paul Junge Paul, thank you
trump, Good luck
trump, I heard you're doing well, Paul
trump, Paul Junge
trump, Lisa McClain
trump, Lisa Great job
trump, It's going well
trump, And Eric Essahki
trump, Thank you, Eric
trump, Good luck
trump, Good luck
trump, We're going to be out here helping you, too
trump, We're going to be out here
trump, I hope John doesn't even need help, but we're going to help John, too
trump, We're going to help all of you
trump, All right We're going to be doing it
trump, Thank you
trump, Also with you is RNC Chairwoman
trump, She was the head of the whole state, and she kept calling me back, back
trump, Sir, one more speech, you're going to win Michigan
trump, Hadn't been won in decades
trump, One more speech, sir, you're going to win Michigan
trump, I said, All right
trump, Ron, I'm coming in one more time, but that's it
trump, I said, That woman is the most aggressive person I've ever met
trump, She said, I'm telling you, sir, one more speech
trump, I said, All right, I'll do it one more time, but that's it
trump, About a day after I got back, I said, I just got back from Michigan
trump, It was wonderful
trump, I get a call from Ronna McDaniel, and she goes, Sir, could you come in tomorrow for another speech Well, whatever happens, she is the one that got me here at midnight on … She is
trump, So when it came time to picking the head of the RNC, as president, you have a couple of things to say about it, right I said, Who's that woman that kept getting me back to Michigan Boy oh boy, she'll be great
trump, Ronna McDaniel
trump, And somebody's doing a fantastic job and tells us we're really pretty far ahead
trump, Maybe way ahead
trump, They had a poll
trump, I think it was a Gallup poll
trump, They said 62 of the people are lying about their poll
trump, Now, they're only lying having to do with my … And I don't know if I'm supposed to be insulted by that or not, but we'll take it
trump, But we could have a very big win
trump, And look, no president has done for Michigan what President Trump has done for Michigan
trump, And you're going to remember that
trump, And I'm going to remember Michigan
trump, Michigan GOP Chair Laura Cox
trump, Great
trump, Thank you
trump, Great job
trump, Great job
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you very much
trump, Thanks, Laura
trump, We spent the last four years reversing the horrible damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years
trump, 47 years of bad votes
trump, After the last administration nearly killed the US auto industry, I saved the US auto industry
trump, Joe Biden supported the disastrous Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have been a death sentence for American auto jobs
trump, I withdrew from the TPP my first week in office
trump, That was so easy
trump, That was so easy
trump, You wouldn't have been making cars
trump, You would've been buying cars from foreign lands
trump, We have enough of that
trump, Biden supported the horrendous South Korea deal that would've wiped out US production of the pickup truck, which is the most … The pickup truck is the most profitable thing the auto industry makes
trump, You know why We have something called the Chicken Tax
trump, Does anyone know what I'm talking about The Chicken Tax
trump, It's a tariff of 25, and it keeps other countries out of here, and it expired, and South Korea didn't want to do it, but they did it
trump, We got it right back, and we put it on for a long time, and now you're making … But remember this, go check it out
trump, The Chicken Tax
trump, I'll tell you why someday at another meeting why they call it that
trump, Maybe you don't want to know about it
trump, But we're keeping those small trucks, and we're keeping our whole industry good
trump, And we're expanding our autos now, our cars, and we're doing a great job of it, and I want to thank everybody
trump, Doing a great job
trump, And by the way, many other things in Michigan
trump, Biden supported the outrageous fuel economy standards that have hammered the auto industry, and I reversed that rule
trump, I actually reversed it, and it helped millions of families be able to afford a car
trump, The United States lost 500 auto and auto parts factories under the Obama-Biden disaster
trump, Before the virus, my administration added over 200 new auto and auto parts plants
trump, How about 200 I didn't know that
trump, 200
trump, 200
trump, I thought it was a little less than that
trump, Wait, I want to see that again
trump, 200
trump, It's … … than that
trump, Wait, I want to see that again, 200
trump, It says 200
trump, Do you believable it That's a lot
trump, You know, I have a choice between teleprompter and freelance
trump, I hate to say, the freelance is always a hell of a lot better, but … If you remember, and you remember well, I actually got elected because of freelance
trump, We didn't have teleprompters
trump, There were no teleprompters
trump, But think of that, 200, we're talking about 200 plants
trump, I thought it was a much lower number
trump, I thought you should put me in an office based on a much lower number
trump, At 200, you have no choice
trump, Yesterday, Biden was in Michigan
trump, He said, I better get out of the basement
trump, This guy is starting to do very well lying about his lifetime of cold hearted globalist betrayals
trump, Biden championed NAFTA, perhaps the worst trade deal in the history of our country
trump, He continued to embrace and promote NAFTA for decades
trump, I told you, he just said it was not as good as the deal I made
trump, I can't believe, oh they're giving him hell tonight
trump, They're giving him hell
trump, What did you say that for Boy oh boy
trump, Yeah, hiding
trump, ‘Joe Hiden
trump,' Look, this doesn't sound nice
trump, I'll say it, and they'll criticize for it, you watch
trump, But I have the distinct pleasure of running against the worst presidential candidate in the history of presidential politics
trump, I really believe that
trump, I do
trump, Can you imagine if I lost to him I'd have to say I lost to the worst candidate ever put up
trump, Don't do that to me, Michigan
trump, Don't do that
trump, Biden supported China's entry into the World Trade Organization, which, by the way, was a disaster
trump, China was flatlining for years and years and decades and it got into this World Trade Organization with all sorts of advantages
trump, Just a terrible, terrible situation took place
trump, That's when China became a big, powerful economic power
trump, But, if you look at the numbers just before the plague, now, the numbers are different, we were going up, up, up, we were beating them like a drum
trump, They weren't even close
trump, We were gaining, gaining, gaining
trump, We were number one by far
trump, You know, for years I've heard that in 2019, China was going to surpass us
trump, Well, in 2019, we gained a lot on them
trump, We were doing great
trump, We were doing great and we'll be doing even better next year, you watch
trump, Yesterday it was revealed that a fund partly owned by Joe Biden's son, where's Hunter See his first name, I now name … His first name is where
trump, Where's Hunter He must be a brilliant guy because with no experience he's taken more money from more countries
trump, He had no job and then he became rich
trump, But where's Hunter who facilitated the sale of a Michigan automotive company to a leading Chinese military defense contractor Does anyone know that China's military got yet another piece of American manufacturing, Mike and the Biden family made a lot of money on it
trump, It was a lot of money
trump, What about Ukraine He got 183,000 a month, 3 million upfront and he had no experience with energy, working for an energy company, by the way
trump, What's your experience, Hunter What's your experience with energy I don't have any
trump, Okay
trump, We'll pay you 183,000 a month and I will give you an upfront payment, Hunter, of 3 million
trump, Will that be satisfactory He goes, Yes
trump, I'll take it
trump, Would anybody here not take that deal Anybody Please raise your head
trump, This is one guy, right, you must be a pretty rich guy
trump, If Biden's elected, China will own America
trump, Washington vultures like Biden and others ripped apart entire towns all across your state
trump, Michigan lost half of all manufacturing jobs after the trade deals that Biden supported
trump, By the way, I don't know if anybody … But does anybody remember like 12 years ago Long before I thought about running for president, when I enjoyed my life, I had the greatest life
trump, Where would we like to go Let's go to Monte-Carlo this weekend
trump, Let's go
trump, No, I had a great life, but I was honored
trump, I was doing very well
trump, I was honored in Michigan
trump, Does anybody know that I was given man of the year award by somebody I came in and I spent like 45 minutes talking about how you've been ripped off, how all your auto companies are leaving and going to Mexico and, by the way, to Canada too
trump, But how they're all leaving and going to Mexico and Canada
trump, I spent the whole time talking about it
trump, At the end I felt embarrassed, I said, I hope I haven't insulted the state too much, but why do you let this happen I stopped it
trump, I stopped
trump, It won't be happening
trump, It won't be happening
trump, It's not going to happen anymore
trump, Biden took a sledgehammer to your state earlier this year, I kept my promise to Michigan workers when we ended the NAFTA nightmare that everybody said was impossible to end, and when we signed that brand new US- Mexico-Canada agreement into law
trump, The USMCA includes powerful wage protections to keep auto manufacturing jobs right here in Michigan
trump, Now they have a tremendous disincentive to leave Michigan, fire all of our workers, go to Mexico or Canada, make the car or the product, send it in here without tariffs
trump, We end up with closed factories, no job and no taxes
trump, That's not happening anymore
trump, That's not happening anymore
trump, But do you remember how bad it was just before I took office It was like an avalanche of companies leaving our country
trump, I also took the toughest ever action to stand up to China's rampant theft of Michigan jobs
trump, Biden has vowed to remove these tariffs and allow China to resume its pillaging
trump, Just so you know, China's paying us tens of billions of dollars a month
trump, Before me, China never paid anything
trump, They didn't pay us 25 cents
trump, You know what I did with some of that money I gave it to our farmers
trump, I don't know if we have a lot, do we have farmers here We have farmers
trump, Raise your hands farmers
trump, That's not bad No, I gave 28 billion to our farmers because they were targeted by China
trump, They were targeted
trump, They said, You know … and that's what they did in the past to other presidents
trump, They said, If you do this, we're going to stop doing business with your farmers and you're not going to be able to get any votes and you're going to lose the Midwest and all of that
trump, I said, You know what I do, whatever you want
trump, Then I went to Sonny Perdue, Secretary Of Agriculture, a great guy, I said, Sonny, How much are they being targeted for Sir, 12 billion the first year, two years, three years ago, and then 16 billion, a total of 28 billion
trump, I said, That's okay
trump, We're putting tariffs on everything they send into our country, 25
trump, Was going to raise it to 50
trump, Also, 10 at 12, all different tariffs
trump, We took in billions and billions, and I said, You know what we're going to do We're going to take, of that, the 12 and the 16, 28 billion and we're going to give it to our farmers who were targeted, and our farmers are doing great
trump, That's what we did
trump, Do you think Joe Biden would do that He wouldn't have a clue
trump, Hillary wouldn't have had a clue
trump, Crazy Bernie wouldn't have, nobody would add a clue on that one
trump, By the way, we had tens of billions of dollars left over
trump, You know what I did with that We gave it to the US Treasury, right smack into the heart of the US Treasury
trump, And we're still getting those big tariffs
trump, Even though we made a trade deal with China
trump, I said, No, you got to leave the tariffs on
trump, A lot of people didn't know it
trump, Schumer went, Well, I don't like to do … First of all, he didn't like tariffs, and then all of a sudden he loves it
trump, But when I made the deal with China, I left the tariffs on 25 and some different amounts
trump, When I left tariffs largely on and nobody could believe it
trump, I said to Schumer, What do you think of the deal I don't like it because you got rid of the tariffs
trump, I said, No, we left the tariffs on
trump, This is what it is
trump, No matter how you do it, no matter how good the deal, they'll say, It's no good, because they don't love the country
trump, They don't love the country
trump, Remember that
trump, Joe Biden's agenda is made in China
trump, My agenda is made in the USA
trump, That's a nice plane
trump, Somebody said to me, Your plane's just as nice as that
trump, I said, No, it's not
trump, That's Air Force One
trump, That's the nicest
trump, Always, that's the nicest
trump, I also authorize millions of dollars to save Michigan Soo Locks, and forget all the problems they had
trump, For years and years, they fought over the money to do it
trump, We got 300 million to the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, and we have done a job on the Soo Locks
trump, They were rotting you
trump, Weren't going to have anything come through the Soo Locks
trump, It's all done
trump, That deal is all done
trump, It's all done
trump, Right Thank you
trump, Thank you
trump, Where are my guys there Good job
trump, Right
trump, Even though you're law enforcement, that's a good job, right Two months ago, I also issued a major disaster declaration in response to the catastrophic flooding caused by the failure of the Edenville dam
trump, Where are the people from Edenville Yeah, good
trump, No, that was a terrible thing and they're working very hard right now
trump, We're providing more than 43 million in federal funds to help homeowners, businesses and communities in central Michigan to recover from that catastrophe
trump, Thank you
trump, Perhaps in no area have our opponents more thoroughly betrayed working families of all backgrounds than on the subject of immigration
trump, Under my administration, we've achieved the most secure border in American history
trump, We've ended catch and release, stopped asylum fraud, and we've deported over 20,000 vicious gang members and over a half a million criminal illegal aliens
trump, As I said, we've already built over 310 miles of border wall
trump, It's all going to be finished very quickly
trump, We're averaging about 10 new, brand new, beautiful miles every single week
trump, It'll be finished very short
trump, We've invested 2
trump,5 trillion in the US military
trump, All made in the USA, by the way
trump, All made in the USA
trump, You know, with the fake news today, I said, And we have systems and missiles and rockets and military and tech
trump, We have systems that you've never even seen before
trump, President Xi has nothing like it
trump, Putin has nothing like it
trump, Nobody has anything like what we have
trump, They said, Is he giving away military information No, I'm saying, We have the greatest weapons in the world
trump, That's what I'm saying
trump, They said, He may be giving away classified information
trump, You don't have to worry about it
trump, These people are sick
trump, Never speak well about our technology because you're giving away classified information
trump, Now, I just want to let people know, we have the greatest systems, the greatest equipment and the greatest people anywhere in the world
trump, There's nobody like the US military
trump, We have the most powerful military in the world
trump, When I took it over, it was depleted
trump, It was in trouble and was exhausted from these ridiculous, endless wars that lasts 19 and 20 years, and you know, those soldiers are starting to come home very big
trump, You know that right
trump, We passed the MISSION Act, we call it VA Choice and VA Accountability
trump, We hold people accountable if they don't treat our vets good, you're fired
trump, Get out
trump, You're fine
trump, We did more in 47 months than sleepy Joe Biden did in 47 years
trump, That's true
trump, We did more
trump, That sort of has a nice ring to it
trump, Right Think of it
trump, We did more and it's true
trump, Just take a look, Space Force, by itself, that would be a major achievement, and with us, we did so many things, so many things
trump, But we did more in 47 months than he did in 47 years
trump, It's true
trump, It's true
trump, A lot of what I did is destroy some of the horrible things that they did, including regulations all over the place
trump, I withdrew from the last administration's disastrous Iran nuclear deal
trump, We paid 150 billion, 1
trump,8 billion in cash
trump, We ought to speak to law enforcement about that
trump, How do we send 1
trump,8 billion in cash In cash You guys ought to take a look at that please
trump, I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem
trump, Every president said they were going to do that and none of them did it, for decades and decades, they all said
trump, I tell this story, it was a hard thing to get done
trump, It was easy to talk about in the campaign, We're going to open up the embassy in Jerusalem
trump, We're going to make it
trump, It becomes automatically the capital of Israel
trump, Everybody said it for very, very many decades, for decades, many presidents
trump, But I realize now why it was an effort because as soon as I got in, I was lobbied by everybody, Please don't do it
trump, Don't do it
trump, Don't make the capital of Israel Jerusalem
trump, Don't move your embassy
trump, So went on and on
trump, Then I said, Let's do it anyway
trump, It's true
trump, And the word got out
trump, The word got out that I was going to do it, and I was called by every king and every queen and every prime minister and every … Everybody was calling me, Please sir, don't do it
trump, Please
trump, So I did what we sometimes will do in business, I told them … When a king calls, when somebody calls, an Emir, when somebody calls, tell them, I'll call them back in a few days
trump, I'm sorry, sir
trump, He won't be able to speak right now, he'll call you back on Wednesday
trump, Okay
trump, Thank you very much
trump, I appreciate it
trump, On Tuesday, I announced that I'm doing it
trump, Then I got on the phone with 18 different companies
trump, I go, Hey, how you doing You called, I'm just returning your call
trump, Oh, it's too late, sir
trump, We called about Israel
trump, It's too late
trump, I said, Gee, I'm sorry
trump, I wish you got to me a little bit sooner
trump, I recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights and we achieved the first breakthrough in Middle East peace in decades
trump, And by the way, on Wednesday, I believe of next week, Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and as you know, the country, a very powerful, very respected country with a great leader, the UAE, is coming to the White House and we're going to sign an agreement that hasn't been signed in many decades
trump, It's peace and its recognition of Israel and all of the things, nobody thought it could be done
trump, It's an amazing thing
trump, I don't say this out of ego, but I was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize
trump, Now, I have to tell you, that's sort of a big thing and the networks and most of the news didn't cover it
trump, Could you imagine When Obama came to office, they said, We're going to give him the Nobel Peace Prize
trump, He actually said, What did I do I didn't do anything
trump, He didn't do anything for eight years, frankly
trump, But he said, What did I do They gave it to them in a matter of weeks, right Weeks
trump, With us, we've done so much
trump, We have done so much on so many different fronts
trump, Remember North Korea Remember They were going to be at war with North Korea
trump, Where's the war Where's the war Where's the war And we have a good relationship with Kim Jong-un
trump, Who knows what happens All I know is, we're not in war and that's okay
trump, They said, But he gave away so much
trump, I said, I gave away nothing
trump, No, he gave away so much
trump, When I said, What did they give away You know what they said Uh, we don't know
trump, I said, Here's what I gave away, I gave away nothing
trump, They said, Oh, but you agreed to meet
trump, Oh, I see
trump, I agreed to meet
trump, So now they're saying, I agreed to meet, it was such a big deal
trump, Instead of being in a war, I think agreeing to meet is okay, right And we did
trump, He's a different kind of a guy and he's a smart guy, a very smart guy
trump, We get along
trump, Getting along with foreign powers is not a bad thing
trump, We're trying to teach that to the media and these idiots that ran our government for so many years
trump, These fools
trump, These fools
trump, You know, you got nuclear weapons, you got big armies, big navies, He gets along with Putin
trump, That's a terrible thing
trump, No, it's a good thing
trump, If I get along, that's good
trump, He likes me
trump, I like him
trump, Not so bad
trump, He gets along with Kim Jong-un
trump, … Not so bad
trump, He gets along with Kim Jong-Un
trump, That's a terrible thing
trump, No, it's a good thing
trump, I'm trying to convince him
trump, It's okay
trump, It's okay not to go to war
trump, It's really okay
trump, He gets along with President Xi, he gets along with Prime Minister Abe
trump, He gets along with a lot of people, and it's okay
trump, That's a good thing
trump, It's really hard
trump, These stupid people that have been running this operation for 30, 40 years, and they come out against me, and all they did was stick us in these endless wars
trump, We're fighting for sand and blood
trump, Sand and blood
trump, Syria, what do you get out of it You get sand, you get blood, you get injuries, you get death
trump, These people don't know what the hell they're doing and it's one of the reasons I got elected, I can tell you that
trump, We don't like his foreign policy
trump, And this is said by one of the guy's that got us into the war in Iraq, got us into the Middle East
trump, So, it's … We're doing a great job
trump, We're doing a great job for you
trump, We're doing a great job for Michigan
trump, Just to finish in the Middle East, we killed the founder and leader of Isis, Al-Baghdadi
trump, And by the way, we're pulling back and we're doing everything so beautifully
trump, If we do get into war, we win the war
trump, We don't fight for nothing
trump, We fought for nothing
trump, We don't ever want to have war but if there is a war, nobody's going to even come close to being able to beat us
trump, And we won't be depleted from fighting in all these ridiculous locations all over the globe
trump, You people know that a lot better than the idiots in Washington that has represented us for 35 years
trump, We took out the world's number one terrorist and the mass murderer of American troops, Qasem Soleimani is dead
trump, We kept America out of new wars and we're bringing our troops back home, and they're coming home very rapidly
trump, You see that
trump, Sleepy Joe Biden voted for the Iraq War
trump, He supported the Defense Sequester that gutted our military, destroyed our military, set us back so many years
trump, I got rid of it immediately
trump, He opposed the mission to take out Osama Bin Laden
trump, He was against it
trump, Everything he did, he was wrong on as said by Gates, you know Secretary of Defense, Secretary of everything
trump, He was sort of like … He had more jobs than any human being I've ever seen
trump, But he said, Everything, everything that Biden was for was wrong
trump, He opposed killing Soleimani
trump, He oversaw the rise of Isis
trump, He was unable to do anything with Isis
trump, as he came to the White House two weeks ago
trump, And we cheered as we looked at all of the success that we've had but he really oversaw the rise of China as a positive development
trump, Remember, he said, No, it's a positive development for America and for the world
trump, He's been in Washington for 47 years now
trump, He's all of a sudden going to change He's going to change He's not going to change
trump, Don't forget, he was in Washington in his primetime, which was never considered great, and now it's no longer primetime
trump, When I banned travel from China, Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic
trump, If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died from the China plague
trump, Biden was willing to sacrifice American lives on the altar of open borders
trump, And now Joe Biden is once again hurting innocent people with his dangerous anti-vaccine conspiracy theories, putting millions of lives around the world at risk
trump, And the only reason he's doing that is he knows we're right next to having a vaccine
trump, So, he wants to belittle the vaccine because he doesn't want us to get credit plant, who converted their factory to produce tens of thousands of ventilators, after we invoked the Defense Production Act, and they've done a fantastic job
trump, Not a single American who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator any time in our whole country
trump, They needed a ventilator, we had nothing
trump, We were left, bare cupboards
trump, I always say the cupboards were bare
trump, We're delivering lifesaving therapies, and have achieved among the lowest case fatality rates anywhere of any country in the world
trump, Europe's excess mortality rate is 24 higher than the rate in the United States
trump, You don't hear that from the fake news
trump, Hey, America will prevail over the China virus, as Franklin Delano Roosevelt said, The only thing we have to fear is fear itself
trump, That's it
trump, We're doing very well
trump, As the British government advised the British people in the face of World War II, Keep calm and carry on
trump, That's what I did
trump, This whack job that wrote the book, he said, Well, Trump knew a little bit
trump, They wanted me to come out and scream, People are dying, we're dying
trump, No, no, we did it just the right way
trump, We have to be calm
trump, We don't want to be crazed lunatics
trump, We have to lead
trump, When Hitler was bombing, I don't know if you know this, when Hitler was bombing London, Churchill, great leader, would oftentimes go to a roof in London and speak, and he always spoke with calmness
trump, He said, We have to show calmness
trump, No, we did it the right way and we've done a job like nobody
trump, All of those great generals, all of those great admirals, our great vice president, Mike Pence, they did a fantastic job
trump, Our doctors, and they don't get any credit because they want to discredit us as much as possible because they want it to carry over to November 3rd, but we've done a fantastic job
trump, I think we've probably done the best job of any country, certainly of any major country anywhere in the world on the pandemic
trump, Through our historic relief programs, we've saved more than 1
trump,6 million Michigan jobs, and over 128,000 Michigan businesses
trump, Michigan has already gained and regained more than half of the jobs that it lost, and if your state was ever allowed to safely reopen by your governor who doesn't have a clue
trump, She's like Joe
trump, You would have regained far more than that
trump, Open up your state, Madam Governor, open up your state
trump, Let's go
trump, Just like crazy Nancy Pelosi, your governor is a liberal hypocrite who lives by a different set of rules
trump, Her husband was caught trying to put his boat in the water on Memorial Day weekend while she was ordering the people of Michigan to stay in their homes, and forcing businesses into bankruptcy left and right
trump, The Biden agenda would collapse our economy and destroy this great opportunity that we're having right now
trump, He would impose job destroying regulations that would demolish the auto industry
trump, You know, on regulations, it took, in many cases, 18, 19, 20 years to get a roadway or a highway approved
trump, We have it down now to two years
trump, We're trying to get it down to one year, and it may get disapproved for environmental or safety reasons, but we're going to know about it very fast
trump, No more 20 year approvals or disapprovals
trump, He wants to force you to provide free government healthcare to illegal aliens
trump, He will destroy your social security
trump, He will destroy your protections for pre-existing conditions, and we will save social security
trump, Remember they said last time Oh, Trump is going to destroy social security
trump, Well, it's now four years, we haven't touched it
trump, We've protected it, and that's going to remain that way
trump, Biden opposes school choice and has stated that if he's elected, charter schools, so important, are gone
trump, In a second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America
trump, A vote for republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans, instead of letting Washington change us, despite all that we have been through, we are changing Washington
trump, We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States, and right here in Michigan
trump, We will enact fair trade deals that create American jobs and grow American wages
trump, We will rapidly return to full employment, soaring incomes and record prosperity, and that's already happening
trump, We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, surge federal prosecutors into high crime communities, and we will ban sanctuary cities
trump, We will appoint prosecutors, judges and justices who believe in enforcing the law, not their own political agenda
trump, We will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race, color, religion and creed
trump, We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life
trump, We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms
trump, And you're lucky I'm here because you're Second Amendment would be gone if I wasn't
trump, And they didn't touch it
trump, We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens, and we will keep out people, keep them out of these horrible, horrible situations where they hurt our country, they hurt the people of our country, and we're also going to be staying out of the endless ridiculous foreign wars in countries that you've never even heard of
trump, We will build the most powerful missile and cyber defense
trump, We've already got it, pretty much
trump, And we will maintain peace through strength
trump, We will end surprise medical billing, require the biggest thing that nobody even knows about and it's all signed and it goes into effect on January 1st
trump, You better make sure I win
trump, Can you imagine This is going to be the biggest thing and nobody understands what it is
trump, You'll figure it out
trump, Price transparency
trump, Did they fight me on that one
trump, January 1st
trump, And further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs at a level like you've never seen before
trump, I've already signed it
trump, Favored Nations
trump, The drug companies are not happy, I will tell you
trump, Just, all you have to do is take a look at all the ads they're running against me
trump, Favored Nations, where we pay whatever the lowest is in the world, we pay that number
trump, We will protect Medicare and social security, and we will always protect our patients
trump, We will always our people
trump, We will your pre-existing conditions, as I said
trump, America will land the first woman on the moon, and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars
trump, We will restore patriotic education, you know what I mean by that, and we will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag
trump, And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God We Trust
trump, And I don't know if you saw it, but during the Democrat National Convention and Caucus, they took twice, I thought I was sort of, maybe they made a mistake, you saw that, they took the word God out of the Pledge of Allegiance twice
trump, And then they said, Oh, well maybe it was a mistake
trump, It wasn't a mistake
trump, That's where they're coming from
trump, Don't be foolish
trump, That's where they're coming from and there's nothing that Sleepy Joe Biden can do about it
trump, For years, you had a president who apologized for America
trump, Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for Michigan
trump, So, get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors and your coworkers, and get out and vote
trump, So important
trump, From Grand Rapids to Saginaw, from Kalamazoo to Mackinac, and from Flint to right here in Freeland, we stand on the shoulders of generations of Michigan patriots who gave their blood, sweat and tears for this beloved nation
trump, This is the state where Henry Ford invented the assembly line
trump, It's the place where General Motors, Chrysler and Kellogg revolutionized entire industries
trump, Michigan, well, you know this one, right Michigan gave us Motown, right That's right
trump, That's right, Motown
trump, We love Motown
trump, Michigan gave us Motown, gave us Motown, gave us the Mustang and the unrivaled might of the American Midwest
trump, This is the state where tough, strong and determined workers made America into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of the world, and we are making it greater and greater every single day
trump, Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together, we will be taking back our country, we'll be taking it back from people that don't love our country and that take back is almost complete
trump, We have to win on November 3rd
trump, We're returning power to you, the American people
trump, With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working
trump, We are going to keep on fighting
trump, And we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning, we are going to keep on winning
trump, Vote for John James
trump, John James
trump, We need John James
trump, We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God, and together, with the incredible people of Michigan, we will make America wealthy again
trump, We will make America strong again
trump, We will make America proud again
trump, We will make America safe again
trump, And we will make America great again
trump, Thank you, Michigan
trump, We love you, Michigan
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you
trump,
trump,Thank you very much
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you to Greenville, North Carolina, I want to thank you
trump, And to, Mike Pence, you've done a great job
trump, Great Vice President
trump, Thank you Mike
trump, And we have all night, we're going to have a lot of fun tonight, and I have nothing to do, nothing, nothing
trump, We have nothing to do but make our country great again, and that's happening fast
trump, It's wonderful to be back in this beautiful state with thousands of hardworking North Carolina patriots, and thank you for your support
trump, Thank you for that very big victory we had three years ago
trump, Time is flying
trump, You getting ready Let's do it again
trump, Right Let's do it again
trump, I just heard that the United States House of Representative, has overwhelmingly voted to kill the most ridiculous project I've ever been involved in, the resolution
trump, How stupid is that Own impeachment
trump, I want to thank those Democrats because many of them voted for us
trump, The vote was a totally lopsided 332 to 95 to 1
trump, 332 to 95, think of it, we have the strongest economy in history, the lowest unemployment numbers ever, we've rebuilt the most powerful military, it was totally depleted when I took office, and now it's rebuilt
trump, We passed the largest tax cuts and regulation cuts of any president or any administration in history
trump, We took care of our great vets, including veterans choice, and veterans accountability
trump, And they want to try and impeach, it's a disgrace
trump, It's a disgrace
trump, So now we have that behind us, and I have to say this, and I'll say it just once, what happened to me with this witch hunt should never be allowed to happen to another president of the United States
trump, Never, ever again
trump, I want to thank Republican leadership for what they've done for all of us, by stopping that hoax, the Russian hoax I call it, because America is winning again
trump, America's respected again, and, because we are finally putting America first
trump, Our economic policy can be summed up in three very beautiful and simple words, jobs, jobs, jobs
trump, We've created 6 million new jobs since election day
trump, If I would have said that, nobody would have believed it
trump, If I would've said that, the fake news would have said he's exaggerating
trump, And I wouldn't have said it because I wasn't even sure we could do it
trump, Think of it, 6 million jobs since election day, think of it
trump, And by the way, North Carolina has had its best economic year in the history of your state
trump, Our country has added more than 180,000 people to the workforce, and think of that through what we've done on a federal basis
trump, You picked up over 180,000 jobs, North Carolina
trump, Think of that, and you have your lowest unemployment rate
trump, You have a lot of good things, but let's not talk too much about North Carolina
trump, Let's win this election nationwide
trump, You remember North Carolina, that was going to be the Clinton firewall
trump, She spent a fortune here, and I kept coming in and coming out
trump, They call it, earned media
trump, I earned it
trump, I kept coming in and coming out, and every time I left they said, I don't think we'll lose in North Carolina
trump, You know what I was right
trump, We won it
trump, We won it easily
trump, We won it easily
trump, So I just want to thank everybody
trump, Seriously
trump, This is a big… that was a big deal
trump, November 8th, that was a big deal
trump, Donald Trump has won the great state of North Carolina
trump, A big deal
trump, That was when you started to see the folks at a certain other convention, beautiful looking place
trump, One of the most beautiful venues I've ever seen, but I don't want any part of it
trump, It was unlucky
trump, I don't want any part, but that's when you saw the people say, what the hell is going on What What's happening And then it was state after state, it was Florida, it was South Carolina, we love South Carolina
trump, Right Unbelievable
trump, It was Pennsylvania
trump, Remember they wouldn't announce the numbers in Pennsylvania, so there was 1 of the vote remaining
trump, If I lost every one of those votes, we still win by a lot, and they wouldn't announce it
trump, They wouldn't announce it
trump, And then we won the great state of Wisconsin
trump, First time in many, many decades, that a Republican won
trump, And then we had a surprise, but not a surprise to us, because we're bringing back the auto industry
trump, We brought so much back to the great state of Michigan
trump, That was a shocker, remember that Do you remember a certain hand on that beautiful board and they said, You know this sport is getting awfully red
trump, That's Republican
trump, There's a lot of red up there
trump, We had a lot of… That was one hell of a night, wasn't it though One hell of a night
trump, I think it was maybe, you know there are those that say, one of the most extraordinary and exciting evenings in the history of television and the history of anything
trump, And you know, you can go, all over the world in some cases, it was morning
trump, You go to Asia, you go to Europe, you go all over
trump, It was just record setting and here's the point, we have to do it again
trump, We have to do it again
trump, And the reason we have to not only to do new things, which we will, and you know statutorily and we had all sorts of artificial witch hunts over our head
trump, Can you imagine if we didn't have to go through that hoax I don't know that we would've done any better to be honest with you
trump, I think we've done more in two and a half years than any president ever first two and a half years
trump, But could you imagine what it could have been if we didn't have the witch hunt You said it
trump, He said it
trump, I won't say it because it's a Harrell, it's a terrible word
trump, So I will not say that this guy said, if we didn't have the bullshit, that's all
trump, No, no
trump, Could you imagine if we didn't have the time wasted the time and everything
trump, Can you imagine And you know a friend of mine said maybe you wouldn't have done as well
trump, Is that possible That can happen
trump, Maybe we would have had too much time on our hands
trump, Who knows But I can say, nobody in their first two and a half years has done anywhere close to what we not being what we, not me, what we've all done
trump, It's true
trump, The unemployment rate among African Americans is the lowest in the history of our country
trump, Unemployment among Hispanic Americans, where we're doing really well, you know why Because they want a strong border
trump, They want it because they understand the border better than anybody
trump, They want that strong border
trump, They want that wall that's being built right now
trump, They want that wall, and they really do
trump, They understand the border better than anybody, and they don't want criminals coming in
trump, They don't want crime coming, they don't want to lose their jobs
trump, They like the fact that their salaries are going up, their wages are going up, they understand it better
trump, So Hispanic American, the best unemployment numbers in our history, Asian Americans, the best unemployment numbers in our history
trump, And likewise women, 74 years
trump, So I'm sorry women, I let you down
trump, It's not in our history, but we're going to be there very soon
trump, We're going to be there very soon
trump, Women are doing incredibly and women… the men are going to get angry
trump, Sorry men
trump, Whoa, look at all those signs
trump, Women for Trump
trump, Wow, thank you
trump, That's a lot of signs
trump, You remember last election, Donald Trump will never ever get the women
trump, Then we got this tremendous number of women
trump, We got this tremendous number of women, and during the election night, they say, What's going on you know it's called suppression polls
trump, Suppression
trump, Polls are just as fake as the news itself, but women filled 60, and I'm sorry to tell you this, men, they're going to sue me for discrimination now
trump, Women fill 60 of all of the new jobs created last year
trump, Women took 60, what's wrong with you, men What's wrong with you But the radical Democrats are trying to destroy all of our country's tremendous achievement, and our country's tremendous success
trump, Unprecedented
trump, We've had unprecedented success
trump, Leaders come in from other countries, prime ministers, presidents, kings, queens, dictators
trump, Sometimes, I hate to say it, dictators, and they all start off by saying, Mr
trump, President, I'd like to congratulate you on the incredible economy that you've created
trump, The greatest anywhere in the world by far
trump, And sadly, China who I have a very good relationship with President Xi, I really like him
trump, But China has had… yesterday it was announced, the worst year in 27 years
trump, We've had the best, and if our opponent ever got into office, instead of being up, 62 instead of those 401ks of yours being up 60, 70, 80, 90, crash, big crash
trump, You would have had a crash, the likes of which we have never seen before, if they got in office
trump, Because we freed up our country, we freed up our economy especially with regulation cuts, but also with those big beautiful tax cuts
trump, We freed it up
trump, The leading voices of the Democrat Party are left wing extremists, who reject everything our nation stands for
trump, But again, I have to tell you, this vote was so big
trump, I have to thank many of the Democrats
trump, I mean, that was amazing
trump, No, no, I really do
trump, I respect it
trump, I really do
trump, That was a slaughter, but many of those people that voted for us this afternoon in somewhat of a sneak attack, a real sneak attack, many of those people that voted for us were Democrats, and I want to thank them, because they did the right thing for our country
trump, Republicans know that America is the greatest force for peace and justice in the history of our world
trump, But these left-wing ideologues see our nation as a force of evil
trump, The way they speak, so badly of our country
trump, They want to demolish our constitution, weaken our military, eliminate the values that built this magnificent country
trump, You have to look at some of their recent comments which are never talked about
trump, When you see the four Congress women
trump, Oh, isn't that lovely I'll give you just a couple, I've had pages and pages, but we don't want to bore you
trump, We don't want to go too long
trump, But we have to give a couple, because that's the great thing about live television
trump, They can't cut it
trump, Representative Ilhan Omar, of a really great state, I almost won the first time in decades and decades, Minnesota
trump, Greg Stanton
trump, By the way, I keep hearing how much enthusiasm is in the radical left
trump, I don't think they have enthusiasm
trump, They're just fighting with each other
trump, We have all of the enthusiasm
trump, He goes home now to mommy, and he gets reprimanded, and that's the end
trump, Sorry mommy
trump, Sorry mom
trump, Didn't mean to embarrass your mom
trump, But it's true, we have the enthusiasm folks
trump, Look at this
trump, Look at this
trump, And by the way, thousands and thousands of people outside and people that couldn't get in, thousand
trump, We've got all the enthusiasm
trump, They're fighting each other
trump, They've gone so far left, nobody wants to even think about it
trump, So representative Omar, blames the United States, for the terrorist attacks on our country, saying that terrorism is a reaction to our involvement in other people's affairs
trump, She smeared US Service members involved in Black Hawk Down
trump, In other words, she slandered the brave Americans who were trying to keep peace in Somalia
trump, Omar minimized the September 11th attacks on our homeland, saying some people did something
trump, I don't think so
trump, Some people did something
trump, Yeah, some people did something
trump, All right
trump, She pleaded for compassion for Isis recruits attempting to join the terrorist organization
trump, She was looking for compassion
trump, Omar laughed that Americans speak of Al-Qaeda in a menacing tone and remark that, you don't say America with this intensity
trump, You say, Al-Qaeda makes you proud
trump, Al-Qaeda makes you proud
trump, You don't speak that way about America
trump, And at a press conference just this week when asked whether she supported Al-Qaeda, that's our enemy
trump, That's our enemy
trump, They are a very serious problem that we take care of, but they always seem to come along somewhere
trump, She refused to answer
trump, She didn't want to give an answer to that question
trump, Omar blamed the United States for the crisis in Venezuela
trump, I mean think of that one, and she looks down with contempt on the hardworking American, saying that ignorance is pervasive in many parts of this country
trump, And obviously and importantly, Omar has a history of launching vicious antisemitic screens
trump, When she talked about the evil Israel, and it's all about the benjamins
trump, Not a good thing to say
trump, So that's Omar
trump, That's Omar
trump, And by the way, many other things, all you have to do is press the right button on your beautiful screen, and you'll see thing after… You didn't hear this over the last two days or did you hear anybody talk about this Her colleague Representative Rashida Tlaib, agreed with Omar's characterization of 911 and said that members of Congress who support Israel forgot, what country they represent
trump, And Tlaib also used the F word to describe the presidency and your president
trump, That's not nice, even for me
trump, She was describing the President of the United States and the presidency with the big fat vicious, the way she said it, vicious F-word
trump, That's not somebody that loves our country
trump, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
trump, Check out her scores by the way, with her green new deal, the green new deal
trump, Where did that come from She's conducted outrageous attacks against men and women of law enforcement, she compared American border agents managing a humanitarian crisis, that I always said was a humanitarian crisis, and they said it was manufactured
trump, They don't say it was manufactured, and we're stopping it and I want to thank Mexico
trump, They've got 21,000 soldiers now stopping people from coming into our country
trump, But Cortez, somebody said that's not her name it's… They said that's not her name, sir
trump, I said, No, no, I don't have time to go with three different names
trump, We'll call her Cortez
trump, Too much time
trump, Takes too much time
trump, So Cortez also, she said essentially Nazis are running concentration camps, and when Mike Pence went down just a few days ago with members of Congress and the media, and you looked at those so-called horrible concentration camps, they said, Wow, these places a clean
trump, Wow
trump, They have air conditioning, they have water
trump, And you know, to be honest, it's not like they came and we want to take care of people
trump, We got to straighten out our immigration laws
trump, You know, in a very short period of time, if the Democrats would give us a few votes, we could solve the immigration problem and it would be so great
trump, It would be so great
trump, But these kids and these people come from rough places
trump, And I'll tell you what, some of them said, We've never lived like this before
trump, They have water, they have air conditioning, they have things that they've never seen
trump, And we listen to her talking about drinking water from toilets, which was a lie, which was a lie
trump, Cortez said that illegal immigrants are more American than any person who seeks to keep them out ever will be, can you believe that That's what she say
trump, She described contemporary America, that's you, that's me, that's all of us, as garbage, garbage, a garbage
trump, Remember deplorables, right That sounds worse
trump, I think that's worse, but we'll save it for whoever's going to be the nominee, and right now, sleepy Joe's not looking too good, Pocahontas
trump, Pocahontas is gaining a little bit, because we probably use the Pocahontas a little bit too early, but that's okay
trump, We'll bring it out of retirement very soon
trump, They have a new one who knocked the hell out of Biden during the debate He said, I wasn't prepared for that question
trump, That's not a good answer
trump, Can you imagine And according to the polls, I won every single debate Republican and against Hillary
trump, Can you imagine Those are the polls
trump, They won't admit that
trump, Many, many polls
trump, But can you imagine if I said, Uh-oh, I'm sorry I wasn't prepared for that question
trump, I'm gone
trump, That's the end of Trump
trump, He's not prepared
trump, He's not mentally prepared, that's his problem
trump, But everybody that knows him knows that
trump, But no Harris hit him with the pretty easy question on busing
trump, What I would say that's pretty easy, and he choked
trump, He choked
trump, And then he said, Ah, yeah, I'm sorry I ran out of time
trump, I ran out of time He ran out of time
trump, And then you have a young guy, Buttigieg, Buttigieg
trump, They're saying how to say his name, Buut-ih-jij
trump, He's a beauty
trump, He runs a failed city
trump, His city is doing so badly
trump, Mike Pence was the governor of that state
trump, I said, How was he as the mayor Mike is one of the nicest human beings you'll ever meet
trump, And Mike said, he never did a good job, I'm so shocked to see him running
trump, Okay
trump, And then he goes back home, and African Americans literally were so angry at him for the lousy job and he's supposed to be like a hot young star, if that's a hot young star, I guess I just don't no star anymore
trump, That is not as star
trump, That's not a star
trump, Buut-ih-jij, you say, Buut, and then add ih-jij, Buttigieg
trump, I don't see him dealing with President Xi of China
trump, I don't see him meeting successfully with Kim Jong-un
trump, I don't see him dealing, and nobody has been tougher with Russia than Donald Trump
trump, I don't know see him dealing with Vladimir Putin
trump, And we have good relationships with them and many others, except now we're no longer the suckers
trump, Like with NATO, we protect Europe
trump, We spent hundreds of billions of dollars and they're not paying their fair share
trump, So last year I went and said, Folks, sorry, you got to pay your fair share
trump, 16 years was going like this The contribution, and now it's like a rocket ship, 100 billion
trump, I said to him, great people, 28 nations, including the US, I said to him, Listen, we're taking care of you
trump, You screw us on trade, and you don't pay your military bills
trump, This is not a good deal for the United States
trump, So we're taking care of trade
trump, We want to do it nice and slow and easy
trump, You know, we got a world balance, but European Union is terrible to us on trade, terrible
trump, Frankly, they're as tough or tougher than China, just smaller in numbers
trump, That's the only difference
trump, With China, 507 billion dollars, a you look over the years, for many, many years, they've been taken
trump, And guys like Biden say, Uh-oh, We'd them them
trump, And he was there eight years, We'd stop that
trump, No, Trump is stopping it
trump, Trump is stopping it
trump, Representative Ayanna Pressle
trump, Is she related in any way to Elvis I don't know
trump, Who knows You never know
trump, She thinks that people with the same skin color, all need to think the same or military
trump, You know they're attacking a single man standing there with a camera, who never got hit and never hit back before in his life that
trump, They're very brave
trump, They always show up with a mask and they're covered
trump, Because then they go home to mom and dad
trump, They don't want mom and dad to know where they were
trump, But they always attract people that really can't defend themselves very well
trump, Right They're attacking this group
trump, They're not attack North Carolina
trump, That's for sure
trump, So these Congresswomen, their comments are helping to fuel the rise of a dangerous militant hard left, but that's so, they are very evil
trump, They're hitting people over the head with sticks, and I mean sticks
trump, I mean bats even, they're whacking people with bats
trump, They're very brave
trump, They always show up with a mask and they're covered, because then they go home to mom and dad
trump, They don't want mom and dad to know where they were
trump, But they always attract people that really can't defend themselves very well
trump, Right They're attacking this group
trump, They're not attack North Carolina
trump, That's for sure
trump, So these Congresswomen, their comments are helping to fuel the rise of a dangerous militant hard left, but that's okay, because we're going to win this election like nobody's ever seen before
trump, And tonight I have a suggestion for the hate filled extremists, who are constantly trying to tear our country down
trump, They never have anything good to say
trump, That's why I say, Hey, if they don't like it, let them leave
trump, Let them leave
trump, Let them leave
trump, Let them leave
trump, They're always telling us how to run it, how to do this, how to the… you know what if they don't love it, tell them to leave it
trump, I don't know
trump, And I'll watch, I'll go back to the, Oh sir, that was so controversial, sir
trump, No, I'm just saying it's their choice
trump, They can come back when they want, but you know, they don't love our country, I think in some cases they hate our country
trump, And it's so angry, even yesterday they went on the stage
trump, I said, Let me watch this
trump, And the anger, they were trying to be nice, but it's hard
trump, It's hard for them to do that
trump, That choice for every American has never been more clear
trump, That's true
trump, The Democrat agenda is anti worker, anti jobs, anti citizen anti-family and anti common sense
trump, With the exception of all of those Democrats that voted for us today, we'll give them up, okay They're fine, they're fine
trump, They are fine and you'll lose to them, it's different
trump, It's okay
trump, It's called normal political back and forth
trump, But I want to tell you something, the Democrats are being violent, so vicious, moving so far left, it's out of control
trump, It's out of control
trump, The Republican agenda is pro-worker, pro-jobs, pro-family, pro-growth, and 100 pro-American
trump, So we're thrilled tonight to be joined by several North Carolina Republican leaders
trump, Really great people
trump, They've been so helpful to me and they're doing an incredible job
trump, Lieutenant Governor, Dan Forest, Lieutenant Governor
trump, North Carolina, Treasurer Dale Folwell
trump, Greenville Mayor, PJ Connelly, I hear he does a good job, PJ
trump, And North Carolina GOP Chair, Michael Whatley incredible NCAA wrestling champion, great guy
trump, He wanted to stay back
trump, I said, You sure you don't want to come I do want to come, but I really want you to win today, if you don't mind
trump, I said, Okay, you better stay back
trump, If I see you here I'm going to be very angry
trump, And they did their job, didn't they This man is from the great state of Ohio, Congressman Jim Jordan
trump, We're going to do this quickly, but it's just important that you get out and vote, they're two great people
trump, I want to introduce the next member of Congress from North Carolina's third congressional district, just won a great race, Dr
trump, Greg Murphy
trump, Greg is a winner
trump, So you know Greg would be great on jobs, all the things you want, tough on crime, strong on borders, pushing the wall, he'll be pushing it like nobody
trump, We're building the wall but we're pushing it
trump, It's like pulling teeth
trump, We've got six lawsuits on the wall, we've won two of them, we're going to win others
trump, But you think it's easy, don't you folks, you think this is easy But we're building a lot of wall and we hope if we can win that final one, it's so important it's going before the Supreme Court, we'll have over 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year
trump, So go out, get Greg elected
trump, Great victory, by the way, that was a great primary and a great victory
trump, That same day there's another crucial election in North Carolina's 9th… Right, you know what we're talking about 9th, I know it's not here, but it's very close, right 9th Congressional district
trump, The Democrat in the race is an ultra liberal named Dan McCready, he wants to take away your guns, he wants to raise you taxes, he doesn't care about borders, he likes open borders
trump, And he really admires socialism, I don't think that works too well in North Carolina
trump, Doesn't work too well in our country
trump, We're joined tonight by the Republican candidate who is really a special man, a great man, he's going to be a great, great Congressman, Dan Bishop
trump, Dan Thank you, Dan
trump, Thank you Dan
trump, And he will indeed defend your values, your family, and he will always defend our second amendment unlike the opponents
trump, They're really into destroying our second amendment
trump, Who've been violently operating for more than 10 years, we got them all, we think they are no good
trump, With conducting brutal, medieval style killings, you know what medieval style is Okay
trump, Little pieces, little pieces, little pieces, medieval style, including the dismemberment of their victims, and they enjoyed every minute of it
trump, These are sick people
trump, When I call them animals, Nancy Pelosi said, How dare he used that name These are human beings
trump, I don't think they're human beings
trump, Most of those indicted were in our country illegally, 19 to be exact, 19 of 22
trump, Think of that, they want to protect… These are savage beasts, these are savage killers, and they should've been brought out a long time ago by the Obama administration
trump, We're bringing MS-13 out by the thousands, getting them the hell out of our county
trump, And when you read about deportation and Sunday, we've got a lot of people on Sunday, but we have a lot of people… and we're always shooting for the bad ones first
trump, Which makes sense, right, but when you hear about that, we always want to get… And by the way, do you know how dangerous it is for these ICE agents, these ICE and border patrol But ICE, they go into a nest, they call it a nest, a nest of these killers
trump, They're tough, they're smart, and you know what, they're great patriots, they love our country
trump, The danger that they have is incredible
trump, And I just want to salute… and I have to tell you, I want to salute ICE and border patrol, and I want to support and salute law enforcement in the United States
trump, These are great people
trump, These are great people and they don't get the credit that they deserve, but you know what I tell them all the time, you have no idea how much the American people, the American public, you have no idea how much they love you and respect you, law enforcement
trump, In the recent democratic debate, every single candidate, everyone, Biden was a little bit slower with the hand, it didn't work so well
trump, They raised their hand in favor of giving free government healthcare
trump, They raised their hand in giving a lot of other things that I don't think you're going to be happy with, illegal aliens will be very nicely covered
trump, How about California, they just approved a 100 million They just approved 100 million to take care of the needs of illegal immigrants, and then you look on the sidewalks of Los Angeles, the sidewalks of San Francisco, Nancy Pelosi's district, nobody's ever seen anything like it in the history of our country what's happening there
trump, So if you don't want Democrats to raid your healthcare, to steal away your money, to bankrupt your country, then you have a choice, you must vote Republican
trump, All American citizens, including millions and millions of legal immigrants who work hard to come into our country, who study, who wait on line sometimes for 10 years, and who respect our laws and follow the rules, they deserve a government that is loyal to them
trump, They work hard
trump, You can't say you love our country if you want to destroy it through open borders, open borders are a disaster
trump, Human trafficking, the first time I heard as a politician, human trafficking, nobody talks about it, it sounded almost like an ancient crime, many, many years ago, hundreds of years, thousands of years ago, human trafficking, it's the worst now throughout the world because of the Internet, it's the worst it's ever been
trump, And the worst treated of all, children, but it's women, women, the Democrats want to do nothing about it
trump, Human trafficking is worse than it ever has been in the history of the world, not just… This is not a United States problem, this is all over the world
trump, Human trafficking, it's a terrible, terrible thing and we got to solve it
trump, Most of it comes through, in this country, our southern border where we don't have the wall
trump, They're not going through our points, they're not going through areas where we have security, where we have guards, where we have gates, where we have all sorts of equipment, no, they ride through the desert and they make a left where you don't have the wall
trump, It's so simple, everybody knows it
trump, The Democrats all know it because five years ago before I was here, they all wanted it
trump, Now they don't want it, you know why they don't want it For political reasons, and you know what, it's going to cost them a lot of points in the election, I think probably cost them the election itself
trump, Just lastly, Democrats also support deadly sanctuary cities which release violent criminal aliens onto our streets
trump, Where we just picked up these 22 thugs, these 22 monsters, we just picked him up in, where, Los Angeles
trump, Sanctuary city, wonderful sanctuary city
trump, Thom Tillis senator recently introduced a bill to give American victims the right to pursue sanctuary cities and hold them accountable for the thousands of lives they have shattered, they've shattered these lives
trump, Thank you very much Thom
trump, Every nation has the right to establish and enforce immigration rules in it's national interest, it's very simple, isn't it It's common sense, it's so simple and the voters understand that
trump, We expect that those who seek to join our society will obey our laws, revere our constitution, cherish our history, support themselves financially, and embrace our American values and love our American flag
trump, We believe in an immigration system based on merit, merit, where they come in
trump, We have so many companies coming in, automobile companies, companies of all types, and we need workers
trump, We actually need workers
trump, We have the lowest unemployment rate that we've had in 51 years, soon it'll be the lowest ever
trump, We need workers, but they have to come in where they can help our country
trump, They have to come in based on merit, and we're putting in bills and let's see what happens
trump, Otherwise, we'll just wait til we win back the house, win the Senate, win the Presidency, and we'll vote
trump, Democrats have never been farther outside of the mainstream
trump, They're going crazy folks, they're going crazy
trump, More than 130 Democrats in Congress have signed up for Bernie Sanders total government takeover of healthcare, isn't that nice This is one of the great… It won't happen, he knows that
trump, The guy never passed the bill, he did nothing
trump, He's actually not even a Democrat, isn't he an independent I don't know, he's running but… He missed his time
trump, Hey Bernie, let me save you a lot of time and effort, Bernie, you missed your time
trump, It got taken from you four years ago, Bernie
trump, Not doing too well
trump, He's not doing too well, but that's okay
trump, I got to hand it to him he's up there ranting and raving and going like a lunatic
trump, I said to our first lady the other day, I was watching Bernie and he's screaming, his hair's all crazy, I'm going to do this, I'm going to do that, no more college loans, no more cost for anything
trump, Nothing, you're not going to pay for anything
trump, He's desperate now, he's desperate
trump, You don't have to pay for anything
trump, I joke, I said, And everybody will get a free Rolls-Royce, every family gets a free Rolls-Royce, every family
trump, And the media said, Donald Trump is exaggerating
trump, He knows that they're not getting a Rolls-Royce
trump, I'm sorry, don't put it
trump, Don't put that I said Free Rolls Royce
trump, But Bernie's desperate now, I watch him up there it's a sad situation
trump, But I think they're all sad when you get right down to it
trump, For instance, we're in this incredible state North Carolina, that you have your best economy that you've ever had
trump, Forget the country for a second, you have the best economy you've ever had, you have your best unemployment numbers, you had the most people working than at any time in the history of your state, you have your best black unemployment numbers, best Hispanic unemployment numbers, best women unemployment numbers, best Asian unemployment numbers
trump, Whoever the opponent is, what are they going to do is just say, North Carolina, I'm going to do a great job
trump, You have the best numbers in the history of our country in your state, so I don't know, and we won by a lot
trump, And we won by a lot I was telling Mike, I was telling my son Eric Trump and Lara's here, y the way, who was born in North Carolina
trump, They do a good job
trump, Lara, do you love this state And her brother's here, I have to tell you, he went to this college
trump, And Brad Parscale is here, the worlds tallest campaign manager in the history of the world
trump, He's the tallest in the history, but most importantly, he's the best
trump, The worlds tallest manager but he's the best manager
trump, Thank you, Brad
trump, Great job
trump, And he just told me our poll numbers are through the roof, he just told me that so I'll take that
trump, We are a year and a half away, but we're doing well, you see it
trump, You'd know, you'd be the first to know
trump, Number one, you wouldn't be here, you wouldn't be here
trump, We haven't had an empty seat in any event, I don't believe, that we've ever been to, I don't think we've ever had… we always have people, we haven't had an empty seat
trump, You look anywhere, North Carolina, Ohio, no matter where we go we pack it and we have thousands and thousands of people, we put screens outside
trump, I know tonight's not so good, we got a hundred degrees out, but you still have thousands of people out there
trump, We could have sold this arena out, you know that
trump, We could have sold this arena out tonight 10 times, can you believe that 10 times
trump, I think that's like a poll, that's like a poll because when Biden goes out I see Sleepy Joe and he says, They had 115 people show up, 115 people
trump, That's our first row
trump, The democratic record on healthcare is one of deception and destruction, the last administration said a lie
trump, If you like your plan, you can keep your plan, if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor, 28 times, a total lie
trump, My administration is defending your sacred right to choose the doctor and the plan that you want, and we are offering plans up to 60 cheaper than Obamacare, and a lot of people are starting to figure that out
trump, Better healthcare
trump, And we'll also always protect… You have to remember this, you ready, because they give us a bum rap
trump, Patients with preexisting conditions are protected by Republicans much more so than protected by Democrats who will never be able to pull it off
trump, Preexisting conditions, and you know, the job we've done on healthcare, it's not talked about, but we're also doing something
trump, It's been phenomenal, we have 180 million people right now really happy on private plans, and you know what, they're going to be taken away
trump, Under the Democrats plan all of those people that are thrilled where they went out and negotiated cross state lines, all of the things they did, they went out, negotiated great private plans, it's all going to be taken away from you under this plan
trump, Now, I only hope they don't change because we're talking too soon, we got a year and a half left
trump, It's like when I called Pocahontas, Pocahontas, I should've waited six months because she then went out and got that test
trump, 1024th, and I've always said I have more Indian blood in me than she has in her, and I have none
trump, I have none, but it's more than she has, 1024
trump, I brought it up too soon so I don't talk about it anymore, but if she should be the candidate, which I tend to doubt, but if she should be we'll bring it up again and I think it will be very successful
trump, 1024, how about this, I was driving her crazy, so she went out and hired a guy to check the blood
trump, I'm sure he had a lot of fun doing that
trump, He checked her blood and found out that many, many, many, many, many, many years ago, there could have been somebody and he could have been Indian
trump, And then the Indians got together and they said, We don't want her
trump, We want Trump, we want Trump, they want Trump
trump, We've taken historic action to fight the opioid epidemic, what a problem, and just today it was just announced before I came in, that drug overdose deaths… we're working so hard on this, including our vice president, including our first lady, including everybody in the Trump administration, it's dropped for the first time in more than 30 years, it's gone down
trump, First time, it was a big problem
trump, And in North Carolina and we're far from finished, it's a big problem, it declined 8 last year
trump, That's a lot because it was just going up like a rocket
trump, Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up until the moment of birth
trump, Well then you have the gentleman from… our governor from Virginia, so we're talking about late term, he's talking about the baby is born before the mother makes the decision
trump, That's the first I've heard of it, that's the first most of you have heard of it, and then they pass legislation in various states saying that's okay
trump, This is a baby that's born, this isn't late term
trump, This is a baby that's born
trump, Nobody's ever heard anything like that, nobody's ever seen anything like it
trump, Nobody's ever seen anything like it
trump, And that actually, when he had the scandal, that became, can you believe it The second biggest story
trump, Can you believe that, how important it is and yet that was the second biggest story, and what a shame when that's the second biggest story
trump, What happened to our values Republicans believe that every life is a sacred gift of God
trump, That's why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion of babies
trump, Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion intolerance and division
trump, The Republican Party is the party for all Americans and American values
trump, We are the party of the American worker, the American family, and we are the party of the American dream
trump, This is the proud banner the Republican Party will carry into the Republican National Convention next summer in the great city of Charlotte, North Carolina
trump, Don't disappoint me, that should be good for at least 10 points, right These are some of the greatest ladies, I see them in Ohio, and Florida
trump, We love you too, thank you, really
trump, How many have you been to, just out of curiosity What's the number All but two, I've done hundreds of them
trump, And then they say women don't like Trump, I think they do
trump, Now I see them, they're great
trump, Great ladies, you're great
trump, It's interesting with women, so women want to have a strong military protection, they want to have strong borders, they want to have strong law enforcement, they want to have great education, they want to have low taxes for their family, not high taxes
trump, They want to have all the things that we talk about, why wouldn't they want Trump more than anybody else The other side is going to go the opposite
trump, And they did in the last election, and we're doing a lot better
trump, The difference is, the last election I was a successful businessman running for president, I said I was going to do things
trump, And by the way, really successful
trump, I'm going to show you something someday soon, I'm going to show you something
trump, They say he was really successful, he wasn't successful, he's really smart, or he's really stupid but he's trying to take over the world
trump, They have so many messages, he's really stupid, then next week, Donald Trump has a sinister plot to take over the world, he can't be too stupid, because they actually think it's working
trump, I saw one of these so-called comedians the other day and he's a pretty respected comedian, he said, he's not leaving
trump, I'm telling you, he's not leaving, he'll never live
trump, He'll win this election and in 24′, I'm telling you, he's not leaving
trump, He's going to stay
trump, So we did through our friend Dan Scavino, we did a Time Magazine cover
trump, I was on so many times, I don't even read this thing, and it says, Trump, 2014, 2018
trump, But it says 20 here's where we go, we start at 16, we go to 20, we go to 24, did you see it Then it says 28, 32, 36, 40, 42
trump, No, we don't need any more time
trump, We don't need any more time, we need one more
trump, A senator came to my office, sir, I'm six foot seven, I'm great
trump, I'm six foot seven so I can give you great advice
trump, I said, Senator, I'm one for one but it happened to be the president
trump, And now I want to be two for two, two for two
trump, Two for two, so we have 16, we have 20, we have 24, and you know what's very interesting though They were really people out there think I'm not leaving, can you believe it Hey, maybe that is a good idea, let's think about it
trump, Watch, you want to drive them crazy, they're going to go crazy
trump, All I have to do is say, Let's think about it
trump, They're going to go crazy
trump, No, I promise 2024, I leave
trump, By that time, just so you know, by that time our country will be so well seated, it will be so strong like never, ever, in our history
trump, But everything that we built, low taxes, strong military, taking care of our vets, all of the things we've done can be decimated very quickly if the wrong person gets in especially now
trump, I've always said 2016 was the most important election maybe in the history of our country, a lot of people felt that
trump, So I don't know, I can't say this is more important, what we did was a miracle
trump, Not to us it wasn't, but a lot of people said it was the greatest election we've ever had
trump, There's never been anything like it, never been such excitement
trump, Never been such excitement
trump, But you know what, if we don't win in 2020 everything that we've done, seriously though, everything that we've done, your 401's are going to crash, the whole thing, it's going to come down like a stack of cards
trump, So, in a certain way, let's say this is of equal importance, by that time we'll have values instilled, we'll have free enterprise instilled, people are working now
trump, We have the lowest food stamps that we've had in many years, lowest food stamps because people are working
trump, So I really think it's at least equal, it's equal, maybe it's a little less, who the hell knows I just know this, it can disappear very, very quickly
trump, We have to get out, we have to vote
trump, That's why I'm starting early, can you believe it We have less… I see all these clowns on television I say I guess we have to counteract them a little bit, but this is not what you want running, none of them, this is not what you want running this incredible country of ours
trump, Every day we make good on the motto, promises made, promises kept
trump, I've had people back there that don't like me and somebody said, very nicely, that he's actually made certain promises and he's actually kept more promises than he's made
trump, It's true
trump, I've done things that I never… I never said we were going to get, as an example with our vets, that we going to get, Joyce, that we were going to have the ability to fire people that don't treat our vets properly
trump, We can fire them now
trump, They've been trying to get that for 44 years, Joyce had been trying to get practically from the beginning, Joyce's so simple and yet they never got it, nobody got it through
trump, We're good at getting things through
trump, We've done more than we said we would
trump, A man I know, who I don't like, a businessman, very, very, very successful, one of the most successful but I don't like him, never liked him
trump, He never liked me, by the way
trump, In fact, I would go a step further, he cannot stand me
trump, And I saw him about two months ago and he came up to me, I said, How are you doing Very warm, hey, how you doing Let's get out of here
trump, And he said, I'm doing good, you're doing good I said, Yeah
trump, I said, You don't like me, and I don't like you
trump, I never have liked you, and you never have liked me, but you're going to support me because you're a rich guy
trump, And if you don't support me you're going to be so goddamn poor you're not going to believe it
trump, And he said to me, Mr
trump, President
trump, He calls me Mr
trump, President, everybody calls me Mr
trump, President, it's true, it's a funny thing
trump, He said, Mr
trump, President, you're right, I'm supporting you, I think you're doing a great job
trump, And maybe we didn't get along
trump, But it's not like he has a choice, he has no choice
trump, And on top of that, it's a good choice because we've done the right thing
trump, And it is funny with the name Mr
trump, President, I have friends, really good friends, and they've always called me Don, Donald, D, they call me anything, and you lose all your friends when you're president because they're all afraid to talk to you, does that make sense No, it's true
trump, Except for these six, seven, ladies up here, they always talk
trump, They're not intimidated
trump, No, it's true, I have guys, I have wonderful friends, New York developers, tough guys, smart guys, they're rich, they're this, that
trump, I have middle of the road, I have poor, I have everybody
trump, I have poor guys, middle of the road, and rich guys, doesn't matter
trump, Rich guys call up, Mr
trump, President, how are you sir It's Richard
trump, Oh, good, Rich, hey Richard, loosen up
trump, This is a guy who used to, Hey Don, how you doing Let's go to dinner
trump, Now you're, Sir, is everything… you're doing good, sir
trump, I said, Richard, call me Donald like you always did, call me Donald
trump, Always call me Donald
trump, Okay, thank you Donald, thank you very much
trump, And then two minutes later, Mr President, it's been so great to… I lost all my friends
trump, They've tightened up, they've choked
trump, You know what that is, they choked
trump, They can't breathe because people have such respect for the office of the presidency, they have respect for the office of the president
trump, They have respect for our country again, our country is respected again
trump, We've confirmed more than 125 federal judges to apply the law as written, including two supreme court justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh
trump, We've launched a historic initiative to reduce the price of prescription drugs, and last year, I'm so proud of this because we have no help from the Democrats
trump, Last year, for the first time in over 50 years, drug prices went down
trump, And that was for a reason
trump, To give former prisoners a second chance at life, we passed groundbreaking, criminal justice reform
trump, It's a big thing, prisoners they've gotten out of jail and they never had an economy like this
trump, We did a lot of things, because they get out jail they don't have a chance
trump, They always go back, most of the time
trump, Now they're coming out and we have programs, but most of all we have this great economy where people are hiring prisoners, and you have to see the reviews they're getting, they getting phenomenal reviews
trump, It's a beautiful thing, it's a beautiful thing what's happening with prisoners, they get out and they can actually get a job and that's what's happening and we're very proud of them
trump, We're expanding opportunities zone so that no American is left behind, it's one of the great successes the opportunity zones
trump, Nobody talks about it, it's one of the great successes
trump, And thanks to our pledge to America's workers, private sector partners will provide apprenticeships and job training to 9 million Americans, isn't that nice Whenever I hear that word apprentice, I say I love that word, that was a good show
trump, They figured, you know what we'll do, we'll get Arnold Schwarzenegger to take my place, that didn't work out too well
trump, That didn't work out too well, we had 14 seasons, think of that, The Apprentice
trump, I've proudly signed for bi-partisan human trafficking laws securing 400 million dollars to support victims of human trafficking
trump, And we have secured, soon to be three years, record funding for our military
trump, We want to cut budgets, but this is beyond budget
trump, I withdrew the United States from the horrible, one-sided, disgusting Iran nuclear deal, and Iran is a different country today than it was
trump, My administration proudly recognized the true capitol of Israel and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem
trump, That was some day, they all said, Many, many presidents have said, We're going to do it
trump, Then they never did
trump, I know why, because the pressure on them was enormous not to do it
trump, And then on top of it, a couple of months ago, I just approved the Golan Heights for Israel
trump, The Golan Heights, another thing
trump, 52 years they tried to do that, they didn't get it done, so we're doing good
trump, We also recognize the legitimate government of Venezuela and we condemn those that want to stop freedom in that country and other countries
trump, Tonight we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country, will never, ever, be a socialist country, it just won't happen
trump, A vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the American dream
trump, Frankly, the destruction of our country, that's what's going to happen
trump, Take a look around, their party is afflicted with an ideological sickness that protects foreign borders, but refuses to protect our own borders
trump, Think of it, they fight all over though a lot of those people are coming back home folks, they're coming back home a lot
trump, We defeated ISIS, the Caliphate in Syria, we're bringing our soldiers back home
trump, ISIS does not like me too much, but I came here and it was a mess
trump, It was a mess
trump, I met with generals, general believe it or not, one general, his name is Raisin
trump, I said, What's your name Sir
trump, This guy's like out of a movie
trump, Watch, he's going to be famous after this but who cares What's your name And he goes, Sir, my name is Raisin
trump, I said, Raisin, like you mean a little raisin
trump, Yes sir, it's my name, that's what they call me
trump, What's your last name Kane
trump, I said, You mean your name is Raisin Kane I said, Raisin Kane, you're my kind of general
trump, Let me talk to you Raisin Kane, get over here
trump, And my previous general said, It's going to be a long time before we take out the caliphate
trump, I said, did Raisin Kane and a couple of other generals that were there, these guys are central casting like from a movie, except better
trump, They're stronger, bigger, tougher, meaner, and actually better looking in a certain way
trump, But they're like from a movie, there is nobody in Hollywood plays a role like this
trump, I said, Generals, I've been told it's going take a year, two years, to get a 100
trump, Remember I want to pull them out, we're down to 1, and everyone went crazy, explain that one
trump, But they said it was going to take a long time
trump, I said to Raisin Kane and the other generals, General, how long can it take They said, Sir, one month
trump, I said, What We're going to hit them from the front, we're going to hit them from the back, we're going to hit them from the, sir, we're going to hit them like they never got hit before, we were never allowed to do this
trump, And we're not just going to hit them from our temporary base in Syria, sir, we're going to hit him from Iraq, we're going to hit them from places that they never knew existed, sir
trump, They'll be hit so Goddamn hard sir, they will be… Thank you very much
trump, Very shortly, very, very shortly, it was over, we had a 100 of the Caliphate, and these people we're screwing around for years
trump, Obama, President Obama
trump, My generals did a great job, I flew there, I flew to Iraq, remember I'm an Air Force One and they notified me, Sir, we're 45 minutes out, sir
trump, We have to close all windows, we have to turn off all lights in the plane, sir
trump, All windows, all lights have to be off, sir
trump, We're turning off the lights outside and the runway light, sir
trump, They going to be in a very dim… Frankly, if you're not at 30-year old pilot you can't see them, because I went there, I said, I don't see any light pilot
trump, As we're landing, I said, I don't see
trump, And then I thought to myself, think of it, we've spent almost 8 trillion in the Middle East and we got to turn off the lights of an airplane to land, how bad is that They didn't do their job
trump, We did our job, and the military did their job
trump, But we fight to short of just keep going, we don't fight to win, I fight to win
trump, I fight to win
trump, So we land in this big, beautiful Air Force One and I'm saying, Major, I don't see a runway
trump, Yes sir, it's right up ahead, the guy's 30 years old or something
trump, They'll get me that, they'll say majors aren't 30, maybe he's 35 whatever he is
trump, They're saying, Yes sir, it's right there
trump, I don't see it major, how about lifting up, let's go around
trump, That's the last thing we want to do in that part of the world
trump, He said, Sir, it's right there, sir
trump, And we're landing and I still haven't seen a light
trump, But these guys, we have the greatest pilots in the world, we have the greatest military in the world, we have the greatest equipment in the world
trump, So you must never forget the 2020 election is all about one thing, you
trump, It's about you
trump, It's about your family, it's about your future, and the fate of your beautiful, loving, country, and that's what it is
trump, We begin our North Carolina campaign with the best record, the best results, the best agenda, and the only positive vision for our nation's future
trump, We love our nation, our nation is great today
trump, It's going to be much greater, every year it's getting better, and better
trump, We have turned this big, beautiful, mighty ship, we have turned it around, it's getting better, better, better
trump, Together we will continue on unleashing the power of American enterprise so every American can know the dignity of work and the pride of a paycheck positive vision for our nation's future
trump, We love our nation, our nation is great today
trump, It's going to be much greater, every year it's getting better, and better
trump, We have turned this big, beautiful, mighty ship, we have turned it around
trump, It's getting better, better, better
trump, Together we will continue unleashing the power of American enterprise so every American can know the dignity of work and the pride of a paycheck
trump, With your help, we will elect a Republican Congress, those great gentlemen that just left the stage
trump, To create a safe, modern, fair and lawful system of immigration, we will enact trade deals and they are going like you won't even believe
trump, That doesn't mean the other countries are thrilled with me, there was a recent poll, Germany likes Obama better than Trump
trump, A lot better
trump, I said, Of course, because I'm making them pay their bills
trump, I'm saying you got to pay
trump, I say, Anguilla, Anguilla, you got to pay, Anguilla
trump, Obama would go in, make a speech, leave
trump, I go in and make a speech, I say, Let me speak to Anguilla
trump, Anguilla you got to pay your bills, you're way behind
trump, So I would think that they should, they should all like… When you hear they like me better, I'm not doing my job
trump, It's true, I'm not doing my job
trump, They did a poll on one of these networks, and they would say, Donald Trump is not liked in Europe nearly as much as President Obama
trump, I said, Or President Bush, or anybody
trump, In fact I'm disliked, but actually they respect us, that's more important
trump, Look at that beautiful baby, look at that beautiful baby
trump, Wow, what a baby What a baby That is a beautiful baby
trump, That's like from an advertisement, perfect
trump, Look how happy that baby is, so beautiful
trump, Thank you darling, that's really nice
trump, It's a great thing, is that your husband That's a great thing, thank you
trump, Congratulations husband
trump, What a picture But we're going to have the country all set for your child, okay Awesome, because that's what it's about
trump, Now the media will say that's a prop, they say no baby is so beautiful
trump, That had to be a set up
trump, I never saw that guy in my life, which is true
trump, Thank you
trump, Good luck
trump, Thank you very much
trump, We will enact trade deals that ensure more products are proudly stamped with those four beautiful words, made in America, made in the USA, either one is okay with me
trump, Keep America great, that's right
trump, We will give school choice to millions of underserved children who are trapped in failing government schools
trump, We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms
trump, They're going to take your guns away
trump, Above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one great nation, as one America
trump, It's one America
trump, We believe in the American constitution and we believe in the rule of law, we believe in the dignity of work and in the sanctity of life
trump, We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way
trump, We believe that children, like your child, should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag
trump, And we live by the words of our national motto, In God we trust
trump, We are fighting for every American mom and dad who wants to protect this land of liberty for their precious children
trump, We have been blessed with the greatest republic on the face of the earth, but it was going in the wrong direction, and now we are turning it around, it is going better than ever before and we going to keep it that way
trump, We're going to keep it that way
trump, With your help, with your devotion, with your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning
trump, We are one movement, one movement, think of that, we are one big beautiful movement
trump, There has never been a movement like this, you don't hear it that often
trump, They know it but you don't hear… In the history of our country, there has never been a movement like this, and this movement is stronger now than it was three years ago
trump, This is the strongest movement in the history of our country
trump, But we are, we're one movement, we're one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God
trump, We're doing things that nobody thought was possible, no other nation thought it was possible what we're doing
trump, We are so respected, you have no idea how our nation has gone so far up in the eyes and the minds of the rest of the world
trump, So respected
trump, Because together, we will make America wealthy again, of course, we did just hit the highest price in the history of the market
trump, So pretty soon, and I hate to say, I don't want to ruin the rhetorical skill, but that is sort of like getting a little obsolete, we will make our nation wealthy again
trump, The fact is we have the strongest stock market in our history, so I think I'll have to change it
trump, You've all heard it many times, right, we will make America wealthy again, we're going to have to say, We have made America wealthy again
trump, So here's one, we will make America strong again
trump, No, no, we're going to have to change this, we have made America strong again
trump, And just so you know, we have made America great again
trump, Give up MAGA
trump, How do you give up MAGA Make America great again, but we've done that
trump, Can you imagine if keep America great didn't work I had the greatest phrase probably in the history of politics in this country
trump, Look at her beautiful hat, it looks very good on you
trump, But look at this, look at those beautiful hats
trump, Make America great again, but we've done that
trump, Our new phrase for the 2020 campaign is, Keep America Great
trump, Thank you
trump,
trump,Thank you, thank you
trump, Wow
trump, Wow, and I'm thrilled to be here with you in Henderson
trump, Thousands of loyal, hard-working, great American patriots
trump, And 51 days from now, we're going to win Nevada, and we're going to win four more years in the White House
trump, And after we win four more years, we'll ask for maybe another four or so
trump, Well, thank you very much
trump, Whenever I say that … Look at all that news back there, look at all that fake news
trump, When I say that, their heads explode
trump, Our movement is pro-jobs, pro-worker, pro-police, and 100 pro-American
trump, As we begin tonight, our thoughts are with the two sheriff's deputies in Los Angeles who were fighting for their lives when a vicious criminal walked up to their vehicle and shot them at point blank range
trump, Tonight, we send our love and our support to their families, and we pray to God for their recovery
trump, The radical left in America is waging open war on law enforcement
trump, Hundreds of officers nationwide have been injured in left-wing riots and mobs
trump, You see it, you see it all the time
trump, Please, sit down
trump, Please, let's have a little fun
trump, We got plenty of time
trump, I mean, here it is
trump, I mean, what do we have Football is boring as hell
trump, It's just not the same
trump, Right I don't know
trump, Used to be people would say, Hey, could you keep it away from a football game Now they're saying, Could you possibly do it during the football game We have some free time
trump, But during violent demonstrations in Las Vegas, a 29-year-old police officer, you know this very well, was deliberately shot in the head, leaving the young, brave officer paralyzed, yet, Sleepy Joe Biden and his supporters continue their dangerous war on the police
trump, They're putting the lives of our brave officers directly in harm's way
trump, At his convention, he never even mentioned the words, law and order, never mentioned them once
trump, Now, he's all of a sudden, his polls are dropping like a rock, and he's starting to say, But we need law and order
trump, And then he goes back into the basement for four days
trump, What happens to this guy I know what happens to him
trump, He's shot
trump, That's what happened to him
trump, Every once in a while, the great Dana White … Does anybody know Dana White He's got some champions with him tonight
trump, He's here
trump, I got to introduce him
trump, But every once in a while, I'll ask him, What happened to that guy He said, Sir, he's been shot for the last … long time
trump, Should have left a long time ago
trump, That's Joe Biden
trump, Joe Biden, he's shot, and everybody knows it
trump, And you know what They ought to be ashamed, because they do interviews with him, they give him the questions, and they let him read the answer from a teleprompter, and that's the fake news
trump, It is
trump, How about the other day Could you move that a little bit closer
trump, See these things Move it a little bit
trump, I must tell you at great peril, I used them seldom, but those are the times we have the best fun too, I will say
trump, And that's actually when we learn the most
trump, For the entire summer, Biden was silent as left-wing mobs assaulted police officers
trump, When Biden's far-left supporters set fire to police cars and precinct stations, court houses, Joe Biden called them peaceful protestors
trump, Right They call them peaceful protestors
trump, And when we go to these radical-left place that are having problems, because everyone … look at the top-10
trump, You go back … go top-20, top-30
trump, Take a look
trump, Democrat-run, radical left-wing, Democrat, usually run
trump, Not Republican-run, Democrat-run
trump, And we go back, and we take a look
trump, We want to give them help
trump, They don't want help
trump, But when they do ask for help, and when they do, we go in
trump, Like Minneapolis, the National Guard went in, took 35 minutes to quell a situation that went on for two weeks
trump, They knew we were going in to Seattle
trump, We told them, We're going in tomorrow morning
trump, And so, they sent them in
trump, They didn't want that to happen, and we let the protestors know, or whatever you call them
trump, They're really anarchists, they're not protestors
trump, So we let the anarchists know that we were going in with approximately 10,000 very tough people, and they immediately raised their hands, and the Seattle police, who by the way, could do a great job if they were let to do their job, but they're not, they're not
trump, And as you know, in Portland, the other day, we had to send in the US Marshalls
trump, A man, who's a bad guy, bad guy, shot somebody right in the middle of the street, who they say was a very fine young man
trump, Shot him, killed him
trump, Just shot him like … It was on television
trump, Two-and-a-half days, nothing happened
trump, I said, What's going on We sent in the US Marshalls
trump, It was taken care of in 15 minutes
trump, Okay 15 minutes
trump, When asked if he would cut police funding, Sleepy Joe said, Absolutely, yes, I would
trump, Now he's trying to change his mind
trump, You ever see a guy … He changed his mind on fracking
trump, Okay There will be no fracking
trump, You know that He went all throughout the debates
trump, He doesn't even know what fracking is, I guarantee you
trump, He was told to say that by Bernie and the radical left and his vice president
trump, By the way, how bad is she She is the worst
trump, We're going to have a woman president some day
trump, Not going to be her, not going to be her
trump, And that's no way to attain the office
trump, We got in there because Sleepy Joe couldn't handle it anymore
trump, Joe is bad primetime
trump, See, the reason I can talk so badly about him, because he did an ad, where he had me standing over the grave and the graves of our fallen heroes from many years ago, and they said … And nobody loves the military more
trump, Look what I've done for them, 2
trump,5 trillion
trump, And in the ad, they have me saying horrible things in front of other people
trump, Nobody would have put up with that
trump, It's called disinformation
trump, They make up a total lie, they put it out, then they do ads
trump, So once he did that, I said, Now, really, look, it's okay
trump, It's okay, because now the gloves are off
trump, I can say that this man is totally unfit to be president
trump, Up here, he's totally unfit
trump, He can't be your president
trump, I've gotten to know President Xi of China
trump, I've gotten to know President Putin of Russia
trump, And by the way, getting along with them is good
trump, Although China, I must tell you, got a real problem with China
trump, What they did with us, we can never forget that
trump, We made a great trade deal
trump, The ink wasn't dry when the plague came in from China
trump, They stopped it from going into China, but they didn't stop it from going into our country, Europe and the rest of the world
trump, Okay They could have done that
trump, But you see, I deal with all of these people, and they don't have the kind of mental problem that Sleepy Joe has
trump, They're very sharp
trump, Kim Jong-un
trump, Kim Jong-un doesn't know about the problems that Joe has
trump, We need very sharp people
trump, I'm sorry
trump, Joe is not qualified for this position
trump, Joe calls for abolishing cash bail and closing your prisons
trump, He wants to close prisons, and he even called law enforcement the enemy recently
trump, You saw that The enemy, until his polls started dropping
trump, Then all of a sudden, he said, No, we love law enforcement
trump, I think I've gotten every major law enforcement group in the country, right You saw recently, I got New York's finest
trump, And they are New York's finest, but they're not allowed to do their job
trump, They're not allowed
trump, We have a radical left mayor who has no clue
trump, He has no clue what's happening to that poor city
trump, I love that city
trump, What's happening to that city
trump, 300 up
trump, Look, 300 in certain very bad crimes, New York
trump, There's no reason for this, and we have the greatest police
trump, They're great
trump, New York's finest, they endorsed me
trump, Chicago, Fraternal Order of Police
trump, Chicago endorsed me, Oklahoma endorsed me, Texas endorsed me, Florida endorsed me
trump, Every place endorsed me
trump, And if you think it's easy for New York and Chicago and these different places … Ohio endorsed me
trump, If you think it's easy for these guys
trump, They never endorse
trump, New York, they said they cannot remember ever having endorsed a presidential candidate
trump, They endorsed me, and they're against their radical left culture that's destroying the city
trump, So I was very honored
trump, But how about Chicago Do you think it's easy for these great police in Chicago to endorse me It's not easy, but they felt that they had an obligation to do it
trump, So it just happened
trump, I'm just very honored by it
trump, And Biden's anti-police crusade must stop
trump, It's got to stop, it's got to stop now
trump, Furthermore, the corporations, these poor, stupid people that run the … They got paid a lot of money
trump, They're weak, ineffective people, let's face it
trump, They're funding anti-police organizations and other organizations that are … It's so embarrassing
trump, And I don't mean for a little
trump, They gave 100 million and 250 … You're talking about serious money
trump, You're talking about serious money, and that money is not used for good reasons
trump, And these stupid corporations … and they'll be the first to go if the radical left ever took … They'd throw those guys out like they were nothing
trump, If they were lucky, they'd just be thrown out
trump, It would probably be a lot rougher than that
trump, These people don't know what they're getting into
trump, But instead of giving money, they should give money to the families of the crime victims and the fallen officers
trump, That's what they should do
trump, So in the Republican Party, we know that police officers are not villains, but the heroes who risk their lives to keep us safe
trump, And they guard … The thing that's incredible … I know so many police, they're so good, one bad apple, and they're on for months
trump, One bad apple, they go on for months
trump, The thousands and tens of thousands of good things, nobody talks about it
trump, These are great people that have done a great job, and we have to support our law enforcement
trump, So Biden wants to appease the domestic terrorists, and my plan is to arrest domestic terrorists
trump, Okay And we also believe that if you murder a police officer, you should receive the death penalty, and that's something that's very important fine people
trump, I mean, they're in very grave condition, as you know
trump, Fine people
trump, He's an animal, and I called him an animal, and I was criticized by people, calling him an animal
trump, They said he's a human being
trump, He's not a human being
trump, He's an animal
trump, He's not a human being
trump, Joe Biden opposes the death penalty even for cops who … I mean, look, you have to see, even for these cop killers who go around, the predators, they murder children
trump, People like the Boston bomber
trump, He opposes the death penalty for the Boston bomber
trump, He wants to give prisoners a vote
trump, He wants to have the Boston bomber be able to vote
trump, I don't think so
trump, I don't think so
trump, I don't think so
trump, You know who's thought of that Bernie Sanders, Crazy Bernie
trump, He wants to have … Crazy Bernie, he says, No, no, they have to vote
trump, So they asked him, Well, does that mean every …  That means everybody that's in prisons should be entitled to a vote, right So they actually said, Well, what about the Boston bomber Should he entitled And Bernie goes, Yeah, he should be entitled
trump, Bernie is crazy
trump, But the fact is, that we got a lot of Bernie votes four years ago, because Bernie's right about one thing, trade
trump, Because all of these countries, friend and foe, they ripoff the United States
trump, We have made so many great trade deals, and you see it, USMCA
trump, We got rid of NAFTA
trump, So many
trump, But Biden is too weak to be president, and he's not a smart person
trump, And by the way, he wasn't smart 25 years ago
trump, Everybody knew it
trump, Now we don't even have to discuss the matter
trump, But I was going to say, when he put that ad up, we told him to take it down
trump, When he put that ad up, that dishonored our fallen heroes
trump, They are great, great heroes of mine, of yours, of everybody's
trump, I know really bad people
trump, No bad person, the worst person I know, I know some beauties from New York
trump, I know some developers in New York actually
trump, Nobody would say what they said
trump, They made it up
trump, It was a made up statement, and they put it up in the form an ad, from a third-rate magazine, who's best friend is Obama, who, by the way, got caught spying on my campaign
trump, He got caught
trump, We caught him cold
trump, We have him cold
trump, Now let's see what happens
trump, Now the Republicans, it's interesting, we have much better policy, but the Republicans, they don't fight like Colby
trump, You know who Colby is
trump, You're going to say hello to Colby
trump, They don't fight like Colby
trump, They don't fight to win
trump, Better policy, but they don't have that vicious streak
trump, If this were reversed, they would be in jail for two years already, and it would be for a 50-year term for treason
trump, That's what it would be
trump, Okay But Biden's too scared to stand up to the crazy socialists and never will
trump, He'll never have the strength, and he's going downhill fast
trump, It's going to be very interesting
trump, And I called for a drug test, because you know what I want a drug test, because we don't want to have a situation like we could have with this guy
trump, I watched him in debates with other 24 lunatics, and he was so bad
trump, No, he was so bad
trump, Maybe he'll win because they don't like me, they don't like my personality
trump, But I hate to say it, I'm what you need
trump, I'm what you need
trump, We love you
trump, We love you
trump, We love you
trump, We love you
trump, We love you
trump, We love you
trump, We love you
trump, But if Biden ever did win, he would surrender your country to the mob
trump, You know that
trump, And he will have nothing to do with it
trump, It's not him
trump, I mean, he's being … He's going to be pushed around
trump, And she's, by the way, just so you know what you're going to get
trump, She's considered far more liberal than Bernie Sanders
trump, How about that That's what you're going to have
trump, I don't think your state is into that
trump, Unlike Biden, I'll always stand with the heroes of law enforcement
trump, And I'm deeply honored to have gotten all of those endorsements
trump, That to me is a really big deal
trump, That to me is really a big deal
trump, And I just want to thank all of them, including the National Troopers Association and Coalition just came in
trump, We also received the endorsement, total and complete endorsement from the Public Safety Alliance of Nevada, and the Las Vegas Police Protective Association from Nevada
trump, And I want to thank for that, Steve Grammar, who's with us tonight
trump, Where's Steve Was Steve here Steve, thank you
trump, Thank you
trump, That's a big deal
trump, Make sure they get out and vote, Steve, because they're playing around with the ballots
trump, Okay You know your governor
trump, So we had many sites, by the way, all exterior sites, all outside
trump, Today, you'll hear these phoneys back there
trump, Well, look at that
trump, Now today you're going to hear them
trump, They'll say, Oh, it was in … Well, the reason it was, we had five sites, all outside sites, like last night
trump, Tremendous room
trump, And a great gentleman who owns this building said, You know what What they're doing is really unfair
trump, You can use my building, Don
trump, I want to thank you, Don
trump, I want to thank you
trump, This is the most important election in the history of our country
trump, At no time before has there been a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, two agendas for the future
trump, Joe Biden has spent the last 47 years selling out America
trump, Look at what he's done
trump, Everything he's done was wrong
trump, He always voted the wrong way
trump, Even his secretary of defense, his secretary of state, they said he always voted the wrong way
trump, He was off shoring your jobs, throwing open your borders, depleting our military, and sacrificing your children's future to China and other faraway lands
trump, I've spent the last four … He says … Only in Nevada can you have … I would never say it
trump, What did you say Okay
trump, This way I can't get in trouble
trump, I've spent the last four years bringing our jobs back to America, securing our borders, rebuilding our military, and standing up to China like no other president has ever done
trump, If Biden wins, China wins
trump, If Biden wins, the mob wins
trump, If Biden wins the rioters and anarchists, and … Look, you see what's going on
trump, The arsonists and flag burners
trump, How about the flag burning I would love- I would love to have a law … This is so sad what's going on
trump, When I see the American flag burn, I get so angry
trump, I get so angry
trump, I would love to have a law
trump, It has to go through a big process
trump, You burn the flag, you go to jail for one year
trump, I would love to see it
trump, I would love to see it
trump, I would love to see it
trump, I would love to see it
trump, If I were a Congressman or Senator, I'd be in there with that one
trump, You know, they'll say, Oh, freedom of speech
trump, That's not freedom of speech
trump, You burn the flag, you should go to jail for one year
trump, I really mean that
trump, They'll say, Oh, it's horrible
trump, He's against free speech
trump, No, no, we're not
trump, We're not against free speech
trump, But I'm running for reelection to bring back the tremendous prosperity that we enjoyed before the plague came in, and it's happening very fast
trump, And I'm running for your state
trump, I love this state
trump, You know, I put a lot of money in this state and it's been a great investment
trump, And we want to keep this state strong
trump, Not for that reason, by the way, for other reasons, because this is a great place
trump, You have a governor right now who's a political hack
trump, We want to put violent criminals behind bars
trump, And tell you governor to open up your state, by the way
trump, Open up your state
trump, You know, just so you know, these shutdowns, we did the right thing
trump, We had the greatest economy in the history of the world
trump, They came in, they … We were all seeing what was happening
trump, We closed up
trump, I mean, you know, you're presiding over the greatest economy in history and a group of very smart people walk in and say, Sir, we have to close it
trump, And we did the right thing
trump, We closed it
trump, Well, actually he didn't think we should close it yet
trump, But later on, he said, We did the right thing
trump, We closed it
trump, We closed it
trump, We saved millions of lives
trump, If we wouldn't have closed it, we would've been talking two and a half or three million
trump, We're at 180
trump, It's far too much
trump, But we would have been talking about … It would've been unacceptable, unsustainable
trump, It would've been so bad
trump, Think of it
trump, We're at 180,000
trump, Other countries are doing terribly
trump, Did you see the statistics of us compared to other countries Us compared to Europe We have done an incredible job
trump, We get absolutely no credit for the job we've done
trump, And I don't want it myself, but I want it for the admirals and the generals and Mike Pence
trump, And Joe Biden was against it
trump, Remember He was totally against closing
trump, He said, Oh, he's xenophobic
trump, I'm xenophobic I wanted it closed and nobody else did
trump, At that time, nobody else did
trump, I was way early
trump, You know, they say, He didn't act fast
trump, I was months early
trump, Nancy Pelosi was a month and a half later saying, Come to Chinatown
trump, Let's come to Chinatown
trump, And Sleepy Joe was totally … He thought what I was doing was terrible
trump, Then all of a sudden, now I see him saying, He should have closed it earlier
trump, This guy … You know, the great thing about the age in which we live It's all down in tape
trump, It's all down
trump, I got a reel on him
trump, We call it Biden's Best
trump, You got to hear this
trump, But we want to ensure the future of America, not the future of China and other countries, because if we win, America wins, and it's all about America first
trump, You've had presidents, they never put America first
trump, They didn't put America first
trump, They didn't take care of our country, but we're taking care of our country
trump, Now, Joe Biden cannot lead our country because he really doesn't believe, truly, in our country
trump, But I think that's a very strong statement
trump, I don't think he has a clue
trump, I'll be honest
trump, The people that push him around don't believe in our country, because he agreed to a manifesto with crazy Bernie, right It's called the manifesto
trump, You know why it's called the manifesto Because this is beyond socialism
trump, This is a word that starts with a C, not and S
trump, That's where they're coming from
trump, That's where they're coming from
trump, At Biden's convention they decried America wicked
trump, And they were saying it's wicked sinful
trump, It's destined for a fate of doom and despair
trump, That was, by the way, that was the most depressing convention
trump, We had a great convention
trump, We had a great convention
trump, They actually said that America wasn't great
trump, They actually said that America was never great
trump, You know who said that Cuomo, the governor of New York, said America wasn't great
trump, I don't know if he's going to get away with that one
trump, That's going to haunt him
trump, That's going to haunt him
trump, America wasn't great
trump, Him and his brother, Fredo
trump, You ever watch Fredo His ratings aren't very good, so you probably don't
trump, But we know the truth
trump, America's the most exceptional nation on Earth
trump, And our destiny is blessed by God
trump, We love this nation with all of our heart and soul, and we will always take care of our nation
trump, You know, we have a little expression, Make America Great Again
trump, That's what's happened
trump, And you know, we had it done
trump, Now I say, Make America Great Again, Again
trump, Comma
trump, I go comma again
trump, And that's what we're doing at a record clip
trump, They've never had a clip like this with the jobs and everything else
trump, You see the numbers
trump, On November 3rd, Nevada will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity, and we're doing it
trump, We're going to have a tremendous year next year
trump, Or whether we'll allow Joe Biden and the group of handlers to impose a 4 trillion tax hike, ban American energy, destroy our suburbs, demolish our second amendment, and indoctrinate your children with a poisonous anti-American lie
trump, Yeah
trump, Get him out of here, would you please Under my leadership we built the greatest economy in the world
trump, He's going home to mom
trump, And now we're doing it again
trump, We're developing a vaccine in record time
trump, The other administration would have been years, and we're almost there
trump, It's going to be announced very soon
trump, We'll be ready before the end of the year
trump, And we will very easily defeat the China virus
trump, That's what's happening
trump, And we're already making that turn
trump, We're making that round beautiful last turn, but it should have never happened
trump, China should have never let that happen
trump, They should have stopped it in China
trump, Under my administration, before the virus, we quickly achieved the lowest unemployment rate in Nevada's history
trump, And we'll soon be there again
trump, You see what's happening
trump, A guy like Biden would totally eradicate Nevada's economy
trump, He would make it impossible for you to compete
trump, And he's already said if the doctor suggested, he would shut down the country again
trump, We're not shutting down our country
trump, A shutdown we'll destroy the lives and dreams of tens of millions of American
trump, Look the Americans, you know, on the other side if you look at these shutdowns, and you're living through it right now
trump, You know, there aren't many states that are shut down
trump, They're all Democrats
trump, North Carolina, your state
trump, But North Carolina, we're not … You take a look at North Carolina
trump, Pennsylvania shut down
trump, Every one of them that are shut down are doing not well
trump, They're not doing well
trump, And they all have Democrat governors
trump, And you know, when you look at the suicide rates, when you look at all of the suicide, all of the domestic violence, the drugs, all of the problems, we can't have it
trump, We can't have it
trump, Open up your state
trump, You got to open up your state
trump, It's all political
trump, It's all political
trump, It's all political
trump, On November 4th, they'll announce, We're going to open up the states
trump, They're only doing it to affect your November 3rd great election
trump, Most important election
trump, Biden will always do whatever the radical left demands
trump, And if elected, his radical supporters won't just be causing mayhem on the streets
trump, They'll be running the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security
trump, And by the way, the United States Supreme Court
trump, And we will have a very different country
trump, You know, the next president probably will have anywhere one, two, three, or four Supreme Court justices
trump, If you want your second amendment, if you want life, if you want so many other things, even having to do with your military, even having to do with your vets, if you want things, if you want, you've got to have the court
trump, Because they'll last for 25, 30, 40 years
trump, They're put on as young people and they stay a long time
trump, Our country will never be the same
trump, We'll never be able to recover from it
trump, So you got to get out on November 3rd or early voting
trump, You got to get out and vote
trump, And you could send your ballot, and then you have to check that your ballot's counted because they might not count your ballot in this state
trump, They may not count your ballot
trump, But we're looking to save and we're going to save America
trump, We're not going to let that happen
trump, So we're joined tonight by two terrific congressional candidates that have been just incredible in the job they've done
trump, You see it
trump, I mean, you've seen it all the way
trump, The job they've done in their campaign
trump, They beat people that were very good, very talented, great politicians, and they won
trump, Dan, where is he Dan Rodimer

trump, Dan Rodimer
trump, And we're with you all the way, Dan
trump, And Jim Marchant
trump, Jim, thank you very much
trump, Thank you, Jim
trump, So we're backing you all the way
trump, You got to get them in
trump, We will take back the House
trump, You know why Because people cannot stand Nancy Pelosi
trump, They don't like Nancy Pelosi
trump, Even the woman that owns the beauty parlor turned her in
trump, Can you believe that Nancy Pelosi's a customer
trump, She turned her in
trump, She thought it was disgraceful, but that's what we're dealing with, a bunch of phonies
trump, But you guys, we have your back 100
trump, Michael, you'll make sure, all right I also want to introduce and thank … He's done a fantastic job
trump, Nevada Republican Party Chairman, Michael McDonald
trump, And a friend of mine, and thank you, Michael

trump, She's tough, but she's very kind
trump, She's a great person, Kimberly Guilfoyle
trump, Thank you, Kimberly
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you, Kimberly
trump, The owner of the Chicago Cubs and he's in first place, so he's very happy, the RNC Finance Chairman, Todd Ricketts
trump, Where is Todd Todd, thank you
trump, Great
trump, Go win that pennant Todd
trump, Win the pennant
trump, One of the best people ever to work for me … One of the best people ever to work for me in government
trump, He's tough, he's smart, he can be vicious, but he's just fair more than anything else
trump, But he is a talented guy with tremendous energy and tremendous brain power, Rick Grenell
trump, Thank you, Rick
trump, Thank you Don
trump, Thank you Don
trump, Also, a Las Vegas legend, Rick Harrison
trump, Rick, thank you Rick
trump, You are a legend, aren't you, huh Great job you've done
trump, Great job you've done
trump, A friend of mine for a long time
trump, Years ago, he was looking for a place
trump, Can I tell this story just quickly, do you mind He was looking for a place and they said, Well, that sport's never going to make it
trump, It's too violent
trump, They just don't know how violent the American people are, do they They never quite figured that out
trump, No
trump, They said, No, it'll never make it
trump, There's nobody like this guy, I'm telling you
trump, I always say it's a great sport
trump, Without him, I don't know what they'd do
trump, I don't know if anything would make it… He could do anything
trump, He is so smart, so tough, so cunning
trump, He's been a friend of mine for a long time, I've been a friend of his, but I gave him a place a long time ago
trump, And all I know is, just like we have outside, we had lines
trump, I said, What the hell is going on here, Dana This place is packed
trump, We were packed
trump, We had thousands of people that couldn't get in, and I was so nice
trump, I said, Let's do it again, Dana, please
trump, And we did it again and again and again, and it became the UFC and he sold it and has a big chunk of it, but he got 4 billion when he sold it
trump, 4 billion
trump, That's not too bad
trump, That's not too bad, Dana
trump, But he really is, he's an incredible guy
trump, And he also loves his fighters
trump, He wants to take care of his fighters and he brought some of them along, the best
trump, But I want to introduce Dana White
trump, Dana, please stand up
trump, And Dana brought along a few of his friends and these are not people you want to pick a fight with
trump, Because under those beautiful suits, there are a lot of muscles, a lot of power, a lot of genius for fighting and for other things, but a lot of genius under those suits
trump, A few members of the UFC community
trump, Here's a man, he used to walk into that ring and he still does, and he's as good as there is in the world
trump, Number one in the world
trump, You don't want to pick a fight with him at a bar
trump, Let's say you'd had a fight and you happen to meet Colby Covington
trump, You say, What's your name And he said, My name's Colby Covington
trump, And the first time I saw Colby Covington, he walks into the ring
trump, Now he wasn't fighting, but he walked in with that same hat that you're wearing
trump, It said, Keep America great
trump, It says, Make… He doesn't care
trump, As long as it has Trump on in someplace, he doesn't care
trump, He doesn't discriminate
trump, But this was the same day that we had our conservative reporter beat to hell by that wise guy, who's now in big trouble for doing what he did
trump, And then he walks in wearing the hat, Keep America great
trump, And he wears the hat and he's going like this because this was a big story
trump, You remember what they did to that guy Conservative reporter, not a fighter
trump, He wasn't a fighter
trump, And it was 10 people against one
trump, Now, if we had 10 people against that one, those 10 people would be in serious trouble
trump, They said, What the hell But I'd like to introduce Colby Covington
trump, Great fighter
trump, Great, great fighter
trump, Incredible
trump, He is a great fighter
trump, Three months ago, I saw him fight a guy
trump, He looked like it would be impossible to beat
trump, I never saw muscles
trump, He had muscles on muscles on muscles
trump, And Colby is a very fit guy and fantastic
trump, But he didn't look quite the same
trump, It wasn't even a contest
trump, It went a few rounds
trump, I couldn't believe what you did
trump, He took him apart so easily
trump, It was like an easy day at the office
trump, So you have to explain that to me someday, Colby, but we love you, man
trump, You're with us and where we are with you
trump, Another great, great champion
trump, Another great champion, Henry Cejudo, one of the best in the world
trump, And Henry, please stand, please
trump, Now, you won the championship twice, right Henry Twice
trump, He won it twice
trump, Don't mess with him
trump, Don't mess with him
trump, And his brother, Alonzo, is here
trump, Alonzo Cruz
trump, Thank you very much, Alonzo
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you
trump, And Alonzo doesn't mess with Henry, he learned that a long time ago
trump, So one of the best fighters in the world, and he's got a tremendous fight coming up against, I guess the number one rated pound for pound fighter, Justin Gaethje
trump, Please stand up, Justin
trump, Justin Gaethje, thank you
trump, And you feel good about that fight He said he's going to knock him out
trump, Well, we're going to be watching
trump, It's right before the election, but I think I'm going to be watching, okay I'll be watching, you better believe it
trump, That's going to be an incredible fight
trump, Good luck
trump, Good luck, Justin
trump, Great fighter
trump, And also Ali Abdelaziz, right Abdelaziz
trump, Great guy
trump, One of the best
trump, Thank you very much
trump, But these are great people that they have so many people at the UFC and they've been big fans of us
trump, They love our country
trump, They love our country
trump, And we loved them and nobody like our Dana
trump, Thank you Dana, very much
trump, Great honor
trump, Thank you, man
trump, Tonight, we're also praying for everyone throughout the West affected by the devastating wildfires
trump, We want really forest management, we want forest management… My administration is closely coordinating with the state and local leaders, with the governor and we thank the more than 28,000 firefighters and first responders courageously braving the danger and their life, and I'm going there tomorrow
trump, I'll be going to California tomorrow
trump, We have meetings with FEMA and all of the different people
trump, It'll be amazing to see
trump, It's like the biggest we've ever had
trump, It's crazy
trump, It's crazy what's going on
trump, Thousands and thousands and thousands of acres
trump, It's crazy
trump, So we're going to be there tomorrow
trump, We'll be with the governor
trump, We're also going to various other places
trump, Washington also is in big trouble and Oregon
trump, I spoke with the governor of Oregon and they've never had anything like it
trump, And of course they also have a place called Portland and we will put that fire out
trump, Just tell us to put it out, governor
trump, That fire we'll put out
trump, That's a much easier fire to put out
trump, It would take us less than a half an hour
trump, We've spent the last four years reversing the damage done by Joe Biden and all of the damage that him and his thought process has inflicted over a 47-year period
trump, We passed record-setting tax cuts and record-setting regulation cuts
trump, We achieved American energy independence
trump, Nobody thought it was possible
trump, When Biden pledged to abolish the production of American oil and shale and clean coal and natural gas, which is very clean, and he wanted to ban fracking, we said, No, we're not doing that
trump, For 47 years, Biden crushed the dreams of American workers to enrich foreign countries
trump, That's what happened
trump, Look, he says he's going to change
trump, He's been there for 47 years and you know that he's been there until three and a half years ago
trump, So it's not like, Gee, he hasn't done it for 20
trump, He was there recently
trump, They didn't do it
trump, And you don't change
trump, And you always go back to the first statement
trump, His first statement was anti- religion
trump, His first statement was anti-fracking, anti-energy
trump, His first statement was anti all of the things, but it was really anti-gun, anti-Second Amendment
trump, He even put this whack job, he even put Beto O'Rourke, Beto
trump, Great deal for us
trump, That's a great deal
trump, By the way, our stock market is setting records, I hate to say, in the middle a pandemic
trump, But hopefully, as we round that final turn on the pandemic, we're setting records with the stock market
trump, Your 401k's are doing very well
trump, Your stocks are doing very well
trump, And you know what If something would happen where he'd get in, and there's a headwind, believe it or not, that stock market would be much higher, but there's a headwind on the possibility, okay Everything is a possibility
trump, There's a headwind
trump, But I'll tell you what, if he ever got in, you would have a market crash the likes of which this country has never seen before
trump, Just remember it, just to remember it, because what they want to do is crazy, the Green New Deal, 100 trillion, the Green New Deal
trump, That's more money than we could make in a thousand years, a hundred trillion dollars
trump, We don't like that building
trump, The windows are too big
trump, What do you do Rip it down and build a new one
trump, All good
trump, That sounds good
trump, I saved the U
trump,S
trump, auto industry by withdrawing from the last administration's job-killing catastrophe, the Trans-Pacific Partnership
trump, And we're building many auto plants, you know that, some here, but we're building many auto plants in Michigan, many auto plants in Michigan
trump, If we don't win Michigan after all those auto plants, and I don't know, but it's been tough but we won it last time
trump, And we're showing a poll that just came out that we're two points up in Michigan
trump, That's very good, that's very good
trump, I took the toughest ever action to stand up to China's rapid theft of American jobs
trump, Biden's agenda is made in China, my agenda is made in the USA
trump, That's what it is
trump, For the last four years, I've been delivering for our incredible Hispanic community, I'm fighting for school choice, safe neighborhoods, low taxes, low regulations on all Hispanic-owned small business, and they are great business people
trump, And they understood that
trump, They understood that, they understood it… And by the way, there's nobody that knows our Southern border better than, I call them the Hispanics, I call them the Latino
trump, I said, What do you prefer It's very interesting
trump, Some say, Call us Latino
trump, Others say, Call us Hispanic
trump, Others say, Call us whatever the hell you want
trump, We love you, we love you
trump, But our Hispanic population knows our Southern border better than anybody else
trump, And they don't want criminals coming across
trump, They want people to come across, but they want them to come across legally
trump, And we have the strongest Southern border now that we've ever had
trump, The Democrats and Biden would be a disaster for Hispanic Americans
trump, He's pledged to wage attacks on Catholic organizations like the Little Sisters of the Poor
trump, They're fighting him
trump, He supports taxpayer-funded extreme late-term abortion
trump, Extreme late-term
trump, He would allow left-wing anarchies to burn down your businesses
trump, He would hand over your jobs to China, and your country to the socialists and beyond the socialists
trump, The Democrat Party also continues to attack our incredible border agents, more than half of whom happen to be Hispanic Americans
trump, And they're great
trump, And I want to thank not only law enforcement, but a big part of law enforcement, the Border Patrol and the ICE agents, they're incredible
trump, The ICE agents, Dana could sign some of them up, the ICE agents, they go into like a pack
trump, They go at a pack
trump, They go into a pack of MS-13 fighters
trump, These are criminals and they do it like it's routine
trump, You don't want that job
trump, I don't see any of the people, male or female sitting in this audience, that wants that job, ICE
trump, They take out thousands and thousands of MS-13 killers a year and bring them the hell back out of our country
trump, All around our country, our communities are protected by Hispanic American heroes in law enforcement, and they deserve unwavering gratitude
trump, I want to just thank you all, I want to thank you all
trump, With us tonight are members of the National Border Patrol Council and they are great friends of us
trump, I want to just thank them
trump, The official union of our nation's incredible border patrol agents
trump, And you know what They're not supposed to do it, but they did it anyway, they endorsed me
trump, I want to thank Brandon Judd, who's here, and Art Del Cueto
trump, Art
trump, Where's Brandon, where is my Brandon Where is Brandon Look at these guys
trump, Look, they're ready
trump, They're ready to fight
trump, Hey Brandon, Art, pick out your toughest guy, I want to see whether or not he can take Colby in a fight
trump, Don't do it
trump, Thank you very much
trump, Thanks fellas
trump, We appreciate it very much
trump, Thanks
trump, Great job too
trump, Great job
trump, My administration has achieved the most secure border in American history
trump, We ended catch and release
trump, We stopped asylum fraud
trump, We've deported 20,000 gang members and over half a million criminal aliens
trump, We built over 320 miles, as of today, border wall and we're adding 10 new miles every single week
trump, We're doing about 10 miles a week and we'll be finished with the wall very shortly
trump, And you think, That was an easy one
trump, That was not an easy one
trump, We were fought
trump, Two things, and I say it, two things that never get old
trump, Remember the Democrats are saying, A wall won't work
trump, Really Tell me about it
trump, Wall works
trump, That's one of the reasons our numbers are so good, but two things that will never get old- … one of the reasons our numbers are so good, but two things that will never get old, never, you know what they are A wall and a wheel
trump, A wall and a wheel
trump, It'll never get old
trump, A wall
trump, I see so many things and I see all these businesses, computers, you come up with a new chip, you come up with a new computer, you come up with a new laptop
trump, Three weeks later, you buy it, three weeks later, it's obsolete
trump, But a wall will never be obsolete, and a wheel will never be obsolete
trump, You come back in a thousand years, a wall and a wheel
trump, Thanks to our powerful new security measures, we've doubled the amount of meth seized at the border over the last year, we've doubled
trump, We invested 2
trump,5 trillion in the US military and launched the first new branch of the US Armed Forces in 75 years, the Space Force
trump, We passed VA Choice and VA Accountability
trump, And I've accomplished more in 47 months than Joe Biden did in 47 years
trump, That's true
trump, That's true
trump, I withdrew from the last administration's disastrous Iran nuclear deal
trump, So good for Israel
trump, So good that we did that
trump, They paid 150 billion, 1
trump,8 billion in cash
trump, I think Dana White could have made a slightly better deal than that
trump, You know what we got for it Nothing
trump, We got nothing
trump, We killed the founder and leader of ISIS
trump, al-Baghdadi we eliminated the number one terrorist in the world
trump, And we're talking over a 50 year period
trump, Number one in the world, the mass murder of American troops and many other people throughout the world, Qasem Soleimani is dead
trump, I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem
trump, I recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and we've achieved the two historic peace deals in the Middle East in just the last month, two, two
trump, Over 75 years, they did two
trump, We did two in a month
trump, And many other countries are coming in, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain have both agreed to normalize relations with Israel
trump, Nobody thought this was possible
trump, In fact, you didn't hear it because they don't report this
trump, They just don't want to report it, but they nominated your President twice last week on two different subjects for a Nobel Prize
trump, But the fake news media didn't cover it, so that's it
trump, Biden got it
trump, Remember… Well, okay
trump, Remember when our great President, right Barack Hussein Obama, he got it
trump, Right Like immediately
trump, And they said, Why did you get it And he was unable to explain, do you remember Why did you get it Because it was like, he just became President, and they said, We're going to nominate Barack Hussein Obama for the Nobel Peace award, right And what happened And then Biden said, What about me They said, Who the hell is he This guy, what the hell has he done But it's true
trump, Obama got it for no reason whatsoever
trump, Rick, you know that No reason whatsoever
trump, Joe Biden brought you only endless wars, I'm bringing you peace and I'm bringing our troops back home
trump, They're all coming back
trump, Endless wars
trump, Biden voted for the Iraq war
trump, He opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden
trump, He opposed the killing of Soleimani
trump, He oversaw the rise of ISIS and he cheered the rise of China as a positive development for America and the world
trump, When I banned China from coming in, highly infected, he said it was hysterical and xenophobic
trump, If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died just by that one move alone
trump, When the- Thank you
trump, I agree, actually, but I don't think I'm allowed to say it
trump, When the virus arrived, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II, we're delivering life-saving therapies, we've achieved among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country, anywhere in the world
trump, You don't hear this
trump, Europe's excess mortality rate is 24 higher than the US, and despite their very punitive lockdowns, they're once again, seeing very large spikes in cases, unfortunately
trump, The United States has experienced the smallest contraction of any major Western nation and the fastest recovery by far
trump, Who's going to do well And there's a reason for it
trump, Through our historic relief programs, we've saved more than half a million Nevada jobs and over 42,000 Nevada businesses, we've saved 42,000 of your businesses
trump, And he's looking at doing all of this stuff
trump, He will destroy protections for preexisting conditions and decimate your 401s, your retirement system, your stocks, he'll establish a national sanctuary city policy for criminal illegal aliens
trump, He wants to cut your vet facilities in half, go to socialized healthcare and end 180 million Americans' private healthcare plans, which they love
trump, Biden pledges to oppose school choice, and he stated that if elected, charter schools are gone
trump, And charter schools have been great
trump, In a second term, I'll provide school choice to every parent in America
trump, A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, a limitless future for all Americans
trump, It's really a vote for the American dream
trump, That's what it is
trump, It's the American dream versus the American nightmare
trump, Instead of letting Washington change us, despite all that we've been through, we are changing Washington
trump, So in concluding, this wonderful afternoon, and again, Don, thank you very much, but in concluding, this wonderful afternoon, and if the governor comes after you, which he shouldn't be doing, I'll be with you all the way
trump, I'll be with you all the way
trump, Don't worry about a thing
trump, Over the next four years, we'll be making America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we'll end our reliance on China once and for all
trump, We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States
trump, We will rapidly return to full employment, soaring economies, and record prosperity
trump, We will expand Opportunity Zones, and we will continue cutting taxes and regulations at a level that nobody has ever seen before
trump, We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, surge federal prosecutors into high crime communities
trump, And we'll be watching the ballots very closely also, by the way
trump, And we will ban sanctuary cities
trump, We will appoint prosecutors, judges, and justices who believe in enforcing the law, not in enforcing their own agenda
trump, We will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed
trump, We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life
trump, We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms
trump, We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens, and we will keep America out of these endless ridiculous foreign wars, all coming back
trump, We will maintain America's unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength, two and a half trillion dollars, have the strongest military we've ever had, beautiful brand new equipment
trump, When I took it over, it was totally depleted, our military
trump, We have the greatest equipment that any military has ever even conceived of, things that people have no idea what we have, and let's keep it that way
trump, We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency already signed, further reduce health insurance premiums, and the cost of prescription drugs will be dropping like a rock very soon
trump, The drug companies do not like me too much
trump, It's a favored nations clause I signed
trump, We will strongly protect Medicare, and your Social Security will be totally secure
trump, And we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions
trump, America will land the first woman on the moon, and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars
trump, When I took over, NASA was a shell of itself
trump, It was closed, they had grass growing in the runways, grass growing in the runways
trump, Now it's the number one space center in the world by far
trump, We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools
trump, We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag
trump, We will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God we trust, and we're going to keep it that way
trump, For years, you had a President who apologized for America
trump, Now you have a President who is standing up for America and standing up for your state, Nevada
trump, So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and on November 3rd or sooner, get out and vote
trump, From Carson City to Elko, from Las Vegas to Reno, from Minden to right here in Henderson, we stand on the shoulders of red-blooded American patriots who poured out their heart, sweat, and soul to secure our liberty and defend our great freedom
trump, Nevada was founded by pioneers and prospectors, miners and cowboys, innovators and trailblazers who tamed the frontier, raised up the mighty Hoover Dam, transformed a sprawling desert into a shining oasis and inspired the world with the brilliant lights of the Vegas Strip
trump, Our American ancestors made this into the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth, and we are going to make it greater than ever before
trump, That's what we're doing
trump, Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country
trump, We are returning power to you, the American people, with your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are, you know the story, going to keep on working, going to keep on fighting, and going to, like these guys, keep on winning, winning, winning
trump, You hear that, Colby You hear that, Justin Okay He's fighting a tough customer, but I don't know
trump, I think maybe, I'm in Vegas, I'll have to place… Is the President allowed to place a bet I don't know
trump, They'll say, The President of the United States just placed two bets, Justin and Colby
trump, I don't know
trump, I don't know, but they are great
trump, That'd be easy money
trump, Well, maybe not that easy
trump, I don't know if it's that easy
trump, We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God, and together with the incredible people of Nevada, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you, everybody
trump, Thank you
trump,
trump, Well, thank you to Vice President Pence
trump, Thank you, Mike
trump, And hello Pennsylvania
trump, Hello
trump, It's great to be back in this state that gave us the Liberty Bell, Pennsylvania Steel, Hershey chocolate
trump, I like Hershey chocolate
trump, The Nittany Lions
trump, The Nittany Lions, they're doing pretty well too and the incredible American Patriots just like you, you are Patriots
trump, Thank you very much
trump, Thank you
trump, Under Republican leadership, America is stronger than ever before and we are respected again
trump, Last month you saw it, we smashed expectations with another 266,000 jobs and unemployment is now more than a 50-year low
trump, We have never seen what's going on with different groups
trump, Unemployment is at a position we've never had anything like this
trump, You are so lucky I became your president
trump, I'm only kidding
trump, I have to say I'm kidding because the fake news back there will take that
trump, They'll take that statement and they'll blow it up and they'll say, He said they were lucky to have him as president
trump, What a horrible thing to say
trump, Because they're fake
trump, Anyway, here in Pennsylvania you had the single best year that you've ever had in the history of our country, not bad
trump, The Pennsylvania unemployment rate has reached an all time record low
trump, And I hate to tell you this, when I was campaigning three and a half years ago, I'd come here, you weren't doing so well, folks
trump, You weren't doing so well
trump, Wages were way down, unemployment was way up
trump, It wasn't a pretty picture
trump, Just a few months ago, I visited the new Shell Petrochemical Plant in Beaver County at 6 billion with a B, 6 billion
trump, It is the largest investment in Pennsylvania history
trump, We're ending decades of failed trade policies that devastated communities all across the state
trump, For generations, American manufacturing was the bedrock of your economy, the bedrock
trump, Remember the last administration,  You need a magic wand
trump, It'll never come back
trump, We found the magic wand, didn't we Then came NAFTA, the NAFTA disaster, I call it, one of the worst trade deals in the history of any country and the loss of one in three Pennsylvania manufacturing jobs
trump, Your politicians always pledged to fix it
trump, They'd talk about it for years and years and decades, but they never were able to do it
trump, They came and they went to Washington and they did nothing
trump, But unlike those politicians, I keep my promises
trump, And I love Pennsylvania
trump, I went to school in Pennsylvania, you know that right I know it well
trump, And I'm thrilled to report that we are on the verge of ending the NAFTA catastrophe once and for all
trump, Congress will soon vote on my new trade deal, the US-Mexico-Canada agreement or USMCA
trump, After years of waiting, many, many years, many, many decades, they've been looking for this, and then we got it done and we've been waiting for a long time for Nancy Pelosi to announce USMCA and she did it on the same day that they announced that they are going to impeach the 45th president of the United States and your favorite president, I think
trump, And the reason they announced it on the same day, one hour later, they announce impeachment, a few guys standing behind her
trump, They announced the impeachment, and then an hour later, she announced that she's going to USMCA
trump, You know why It's a huge deal and it plays down the impeachment because they are embarrassed by the impeachment, and our poll numbers have gone through the roof because of her stupid impeachment
trump, And think of it this way also, the silver lining of impeachment and this witch hunt, that's the reason they approved USMCA
trump, So that's okay with me, because they approved it and they're very happy to have it
trump, But honestly, it's an incredible deal for our country
trump, Took too long, it waited in Congress for too long a time
trump, Incredible deal, and replacing the worst, NAFTA
trump, We've also just reached a deal with Congress to invest a record 738 billion more into our great military
trump, When I took over, I will tell you, I became president… Think of it, almost three years ago
trump, By the way, was that the most exciting night ever I'm just watching these people, that was one of the greatest evenings in the history of television from a rating standpoint, from an excitement standpoint, what the hell would they do without me and you They'd be gone
trump, About a month before I ran, I picked up a New York Times, it was like a leaflet that you had out at a grocery store and now it's thick
trump, They've got all their reporters covering Trump, Trump, Trump
trump, I can't imagine they won't endorse because without me winning, you know what happens They all go down the tombs they got, all of them, Washington Post, New York Times, those very dishonest networks
trump, They are very dishonest, very, very dishones
trump, No, they're very dishonest people
trump, And I have to say this, look, and I always have to say this, you have some really great journalists and you have some honest publications, but not too many of them, I have to be honest with you
trump, Well, you know that
trump, Does anybody think the media is honest Does anybody think they're totally corrupted and dishonest All right
trump, The legislation will also officially establish something that's so important to me because it's where it's at
trump, And a lot of people used to smile and now outside of the wall, which we're building… The wall is going on
trump, It gets one of the biggest applause of anything, it's the sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces, the Space Force
trump, We're opening up the Space Force because you know what, that's where it's at
trump, And everything's built right here in the United States
trump, That's simple
trump, And by the way, we build the greatest weapons, the greatest planes, the greatest ships, we build it in the United States, there's nobody that comes close
trump, We have the greatest military equipment anywhere in the world, rockets and missiles, no place builds it like us
trump, We have the best in the world and we sell it to allies and they all want to buy from the United States
trump, We've never had a thing like this
trump, We are so hot
trump, We are so hot
trump, And just a few weeks ago, the United States Special Forces brought the world's number one terrorist to justice
trump, Thanks to the strength and courage of our warriors, and they're great warriors, the bloodthirsty savage known as Al Baghdadi is now dead
trump, And he was quickly replaced by his second-in-command and his second-in-command is now dead
trump, And we've got our eye on and our sights on third also, we know exactly where and when, but it's becoming a very unpopular job, not a lot of takers and that's what we want
trump, Go back to living a good normal life because America is winning again
trump, America is winning again like never before
trump, And as I always say, and I've already said it twice tonight, this country is so respected and we were not respected four years ago, we were laughed at
trump, But while we're delivering historic victories for the American people, the radical left Democrats and the failed Washington establishment are trying to erase your votes, nullify the election and overthrow our democracy
trump, Not going to happen, don't worry about it
trump, I wouldn't lose too much sleep over it
trump, And I have to say this about the Republicans, the Republicans… And you have a lot of great ones here tonight, your Congressman
trump, You have a lot of great ones, these congressmen are great
trump, The Republicans have never been so United as they are right now, ever
trump, The House, the Senate, we've never been this United because it's all a hoax and they understand it
trump, They also understand poll numbers, but I'm sure that had nothing to do with it
trump, But the impeachment hoax is about overturning your great 2016 vote, or in the alternative, trying to win the 2020 election
trump, That's not going to happen
trump, Yesterday, the Justice Department's Inspector General released a report detailing the outrageous, scandalous and unprecedented abuses of power
trump, Get them out
trump, Get her out
trump, Get her out
trump, Get her out
trump, See, these guys want to be so politically correct, you get her out
trump, You see that I'll tell you, law enforcement is so great
trump, That particular guy wanted to be so politically correct
trump, We don't want to be politically correct
trump, I don't know who he was, he didn't do the greatest job, so they tried to frame innocent people in the ludicrous… It all started with the Russia witch hunt
trump, Then the inspector general shocking report proved that the Obama FBI obtained secret warrants to spy on my campaign based on a phony foreign dossier of debunk smears, paid for by crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC
trump, The FBI failed to disclose the nature of the political hit job to the Pfizer court
trump, They hid it, they deceived it, and they lied
trump, The dossier was written by a discredited foreign agent who quote, Desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being the United States president
trump, What's this Folks, they spied on our campaign, they spied
trump, Never happened before in the history of our country and we're really wise to it
trump, We're wise to it
trump, The inspector general found that the FBI spying application contained 17 errors and omissions, commonly known as lies and deceit
trump, When the FBI… And you have great people in the FBI, but not in leadership
trump, You have not good people in leadership, you haven't had
trump, When the FBI uncovered evidence showing that we did absolutely nothing wrong, which was right at the beginning, they hid that exonerating, you know that They hid it
trump, They hid it so nobody could see it, so they could keep this hoax going on for two years
trump, They knew right at the beginning that it was all a frame up, a set up, but they hid it so that nobody could see it, so they could keep it going on, thinking they were going to hurt us politically
trump, But now we're stronger politically than we were ever before
trump, And the FBI also sent multiple undercover human spies to surveil and record people associated with our campaign
trump, Look how they've hurt people
trump, They've destroyed the lives of people that were great people, that are still great people
trump, Their lives have been destroyed by scum, by scum
trump, An FBI lawyer forged, took an email… forged, forged an email used as evidence, an act which is now the subject of a criminal referral
trump, What they did is so unbelievable
trump, Oh, I look forward… I don't know
trump, I don't know, keep away
trump, I look forward to Bull Durham's report, that's the one I look forward to
trump, And this report was great by the IG, especially since he was appointed by President Barack Hussein Obama
trump, Considering that fact, it was great because we learned a lot of things that nobody would have found out variously, although I suspect we would have
trump, We also know from a previous inspector general investigation that many of these same high ranking officials were consumed with anti- Trump and anti-Trump people hatred and bias, texting about an insurance policy, let's have an insurance… remember Remember Peter Strzok and his lover, Lisa Page
trump, Remember Lisa, I love you so much
trump, Lisa, please, Lisa please
trump, Lisa, I've never loved anyone like you
trump, We won't allow this to happen to our country
trump, Lisa, please tell me you love me
trump, Lisa, I love you
trump, Peter, I love you
trump, I love you like I've never loved anyone
trump, And if for any reason she loses, even though she's a stone called corrupt person, if for any reason she loses, Peter, we've got to have an insurance policy, we have to do it because we're going to go…  And that's what's been happening for the last two and a half years
trump, It was their phony insurance policy
trump, So FBI lawyer, Lisa Page, so in love that she didn't know what the hell was happening texted the head of Counter Intelligence, Peter Strzok, likewise so in love he couldn't see straight
trump, This poor guy, did I hear he needed a restraining order after this whole thing to keep him away from Lisa That's what I heard
trump, I don't know if it's true
trump, The fake news will never report it, but it could be true
trump, No, that's what I heard
trump, I don't know
trump, I mean who could believe a thing like that No, I heard that Peter Strzok needed a restraining order to keep him away from his once lover
trump, Ah, Lisa, I hope you're miss him
trump, Lisa, he'll never be the same
trump, But he said he's not ever going to become president and Strzok look back, No, no, he won't
trump, We'll stop it
trump, We'll stop it
trump, Can you believe we found these texts This is FBI agents at a high level
trump, No, no
trump, We'll stop it
trump, They're going to stop us from winning an election and then we have to listen, There was no bias
trump, Oh, there was no bias
trump, Think of these people, they write here was no bias
trump, And yet he saying, No, no, darling, we'll stop it
trump, And then they announce there was no bias
trump, Now you know what we're doing, and it's not easy, and somebody said a regular president… I don't want to use the word normal because that's not a nice normal refer… A regular president would have been under a table, thumb in the mouth saying, Take me home mommy, this is too tough for me
trump, It's true
trump, True, they know
trump, And while it was tough on my family, I have to say, very unfair to my family, very tough on my family
trump, I have a great family, tough… For me, it's my life
trump, I do it, I do it
trump, It's one thing, but very tough on a family thing, a thing like this happens, it's a disgrace
trump, But day after day we're exposing something called that filthy, disgusting, horrible swamp and we're cleaning it up
trump, And now after and a half years now that the Russia witch hunt is dead, a big fat disgusting fraud, the Congressional Democrats are pushing the impeachment witch hunt having to do with Ukraine, but that's already failing
trump, You saw their so-called articles of impeachment today, people are saying they're not even a crime
trump, What happened All of these horrible things, remember Bribery and this and that
trump, Where are they They send these two things and not even a crime
trump, This is the lightest, weakest impeachment…
trump, Our country has had actually many impeachments, you recall judges and lots of… many impeachments, but it was on today, everybody said, This is impeachment light
trump, This is the lightest impeachment in the history of our country by far
trump, It's not even like an impeachment
trump, These people are stone cold crooked
trump, When a guy like shifty Schiff, he's a corrupt politician, he made up my statement because… See, I did one thing very good, as soon as I heard about this deal, I released my statement immediately, but he had already made horrible statements
trump, And by the way, the whistleblower, the whistleblower defrauded our country because the whistleblower wrote something that was totally untrue and we broke up the game
trump, Remember the second whistleblower was coming, right And then the informer, who is the informer I know who the informer is
trump, So the informer obviously gave him a false information because they wrote in the whistleblower report, they wrote something totally different from what I said, what I said was perfect
trump, But it screwed up the whole works because most guys would never do that
trump, They didn't even know probably that we had it transcribed, professionally transcribed, word for word transcribed, so beautiful
trump, Am I lucky I had it transcribed Think of that
trump, Think of that
trump, So when I said release it… And I don't like doing that because you're releasing it, it's a conversation with a foreign leader, in this case, a very fine gentlemen, president of Ukraine, the new president of Ukraine
trump, And we call them up and we said, Would it be okay Our secretary of state made the call, Would it be okay And they didn't know what we were talking about, but they said, Yeah, it's okay
trump, And by the way, he, his foreign minister, everybody did you know they said, There was no pressure
trump, He didn't do anything wrong
trump, There was no pressure put on us
trump, That didn't stop anybody but we released the conversation and that gummed it up
trump, Now, all of a sudden we never heard from the second whistleblower
trump, We never heard about who the informer was
trump, The whistleblower who's going to come out strong, he's disappeared
trump, Where's the whistleblower He's disappeared
trump, He's gone
trump, Maybe our great Congressman can find him
trump, He's gone
trump, Maybe our great Congressmen can find him
trump, Okay But the whistleblower is gone
trump, He flew the coop because he reported incorrectly, and the IG, who didn't want to look at the conversation, he was so anxious to turn the whistleblower report over to Congress so that Congress could have fun with it, ought to be ashamed of himself
trump, But today, the House Democrats announced these two flimsy, pathetic, ridiculous articles of impeachment
trump, The House Democrats are walking back from everything they claimed
trump, With today's announcement, they're now admitting there was no collusion, there was no obstruction of justice, and there were no crimes whatsoever
trump, There are no crimes
trump, It says that, there are no crimes
trump, They're impeaching me and there are no crimes
trump, This has to be a first in history
trump, They're impeaching me
trump, You know why Because they want to win an election
trump, And that's the only way they can do it
trump, So the Democrats have nothing, and they've turned the somber process of impeachment
trump, And it was, you know, to me, impeachment is a very ugly word
trump, It's a word I associate with some very bad times in our country
trump, The good news is we're having the best times in history in our country
trump, Okay But the word impeachment, to me, is a very, very ugly word
trump, It's a dark, ugly word
trump, But, but I have to tell you, as bad as it is, it meant something
trump, When you had serious high crimes and misdemeanors, when you had serious, go ahead, it's impeachment
trump, That would happen every 50 years, every 40 years, every 100 years
trump, This was a big deal
trump, They're making it so like, Let's do it every six months
trump, They've cheapened a process
trump, They've cheapened a process
trump, These people are so bad, the radical left Democrats, and I actually think that Pelosi, who by the way, by the way, by the way, she has totally lost control
trump, She has totally … It's being run now by this crazy AOC plus three
trump, AOC plus three
trump, Now it's being run by other people
trump, The far left has just grabbed that party
trump, It is so sad to see
trump, And she knew what would happen
trump, I didn't, because I didn't figure the polls would go through the roof
trump, They went out today
trump, In Michigan, in Wisconsin, in a place called Pennsylvania
trump, No, no
trump, The polls are through the roof
trump, They're called swing states, very important states
trump, We won Pennsylvania the last time, and we're going to win it again, but even bigger
trump, Our polls have gone, over the last month, they've gone through the roof
trump, You look at it, take a look at it, it came out today
trump, The FireHouse poll, it's an important poll
trump, It was always good
trump, I never looked at it
trump, Today, I like it a lot
trump, We're up through … nobody can even believe it
trump, So what Pelosi did, and as I said, they do the impeachment, then right away, let's do USMCA, right on top of it
trump, You'd think she'd wait like a day
trump, She wanted to smother the impeachment crap, and that's probably what she did, at least to an extent
trump, But any Democrat that votes for this sham will be voting to sacrifice their house majority, their dignity, and their career
trump, Okay And some of these partisan lunatics have already said that if they fail this time, think of this
trump, How about Low IQ Maxine Waters How about Green How about Green We've Green
trump, How about Green, where he said, We have to impeach him because if we don't impeach him we're not going to win the election
trump, This is what we're dealing with
trump, You know, we're dealing with some very bad people
trump, We're dealing with people that don't respect you
trump, And by the way, you know they talk about the elite You're the elite
trump, They're not the elite
trump, You're the elite
trump, You're the elite
trump, You got better education
trump, You got better everything
trump, You're the elite
trump, It always bothers me, they said, The elite
trump, This is the elite
trump, Look at these people
trump, How beautiful
trump, This is the elite
trump, You know who are the elite You look at those jobs reports
trump, We're the best in history unemployment for African Americans, best in history unemployment Hispanic Americans, best in history unemployment Asian Americans
trump, You're the elite
trump, You're the elite
trump, But they said they'll do it again because this has been a total bust
trump, They'll do it again
trump, And by the way, the Senate's been so professional, so good, so strong, so solid
trump, Just like these gentlemen in the House
trump, So solid
trump, So we have to vote these crazy people the hell out of office
trump, And in 2020 I'm going to work like hell that we take over the House
trump, We have to take over the House
trump, We have to
trump, Right Got to take over the House, Mike
trump, So here are the facts that Shifty Schiff … Is that guy the worst He comes up to a microphone, now he comes up to a microphone like two and a half years ago, I have absolute proof that the President of the United States conspired with Russia
trump, Russia What the hell do I have to do with Russia By the way, Russia wishes that Hillary Clinton won
trump, They wish
trump, We are now number one in the world in energy
trump, Russia is number three
trump, We're beating out Russia and Saudi Arabia
trump, You'd have windmills all over the place if you had Crooked Hillary
trump, They'd be knocking out those birds left and right
trump, Those windmills
trump, Wah, wah, wah
trump, Darling, I want to watch television tonight and there's no damn wind
trump, What do I do I want to watch the election results
trump, Darling, there's no wind
trump, The damn wind just isn't blowing like it used to because of global warming, I think
trump, I think it's global warming
trump, Global warming
trump, No more wind, no more life
trump, The ocean is going to rise 18 of an inch within the next 250 years
trump, We're going to be wiped out Look, I want clean air
trump, I want clean water, crystal clean, I want, and that's what we have at a record level
trump, Our air and our water are cleaner now than it's ever been with all that we're doing, and we haven't closed up all of our industry, and we haven't closed up our businesses and lost all those jobs
trump, And right now, we're by far the largest economy in the world
trump, If you remember, you could look, if you go back five, six, seven years, in 2019 they say China was going to catch us as the world's largest economy
trump, Guess what They're way behind
trump, They're way behind
trump, Because over the last three years, you see the stock market set 131 records from the day
trump, Think of that
trump, And that means jobs, that means 401ks
trump, I have so many people that come up to me, Thank you, sir
trump, My wife is so in love with me because I went up 79 in the 401k
trump, She thinks I'm a genius
trump, She always thought I was a total stiff, a dumb, stupid dope
trump, Now she thinks I'm a financial genius, sir
trump, And all I did was buy some stock
trump, I have stock in a 401k, and you made me into a genius, sir
trump, She loves me so much more than she ever did
trump, Shows you the power of money, right Isn't that terrible But I have so many people, 401ks are through the roof, your jobs are through the roof, we have the lowest unemployment rate
trump, And now, more importantly than anything, wages are up for the first time in many, many years, decades, decades
trump, You remember four years ago I was here, and I told people, I said, You know, 20 years ago, people made more money than they made four years ago
trump, Not now
trump, Not anymore
trump, Because people now can not only make a lot more money, if they don't like their job, they go out and they get a different job, and they get more money, and ultimately they find one that they love
trump, You have so many opportunities right now
trump, Wages are up, jobs are up
trump, And today we set a new record, almost 160 million people are working
trump, We've never come close to that number
trump, That's a hell of a number
trump, But just quickly, here are the facts on Shifty Schiff
trump, Dishonest guy, makes up my statements
trump, He said, The President of Ukraine repeatedly declared that there was no pressure, but he didn't want to say that
trump, We said, Say it
trump, Say it, you crooked bastard, say it
trump, But he doesn't want to say it
trump, We said, Sat it I'd like to force him to say it
trump, He'll walk up to the mic, Ladies and gentlemen, guy's a total corrupt guy
trump, Listen, just to finish off, a man who I really, I don't know him, but I respect him because the Ukrainian Foreign Minister, and he said it so strongly, I have never seen a direct link between investigations and security assistance
trump, He just said that the Democrats, who are corrupt, refuse to say that, and that's ultimately the only one that matters, the leaders of Ukraine, because they're the ones that know of this pressure, not some crooked ambassador that's a deep stater, or that's a Bushy, or that's a Clintonite, or that's a Barack Obama ambassador
trump, Okay The ones that matter are the leadership of the country that we're talking about
trump, They refuse to say it because they're dishonest people
trump, There's only one way to stop the rabid partisan Democrats, Pennsylvania voters must show up in 2020 so we can take back the House, hold the Senate, and keep the White House
trump, It's the only way
trump, Only way
trump, Okay, so I'm going to ask these people to come up on this stage because we have warriors with us tonight
trump, We love warriors, like the guys that killed al-Baghdadi
trump, You know how much press I got I don't care about press
trump, But Conan the dog got more than I did, and that's okay
trump, Conan was almost electrocuted, he deserves it
trump, They gave me about a day, and that's okay, because the people understand, we made a great decision
trump, And remember this, al-Baghdadi was the founder of ISIS, al-Baghdadi was a vicious, ruthless person, al-Baghdadi created a caliphate bigger than the State of Ohio
trump, Think of that, that's a big caliphate
trump, And we now have taken 100 of the caliphate, and we have thousands and thousands of ISIS prisoners
trump, With Obama, you did nothing
trump, You did nothing but get your ass kicked
trump, True
trump, True
trump, All right, we're joined tonight by many of the terrific warriors that have helped me so much in so many ways
trump, They fight for us
trump, They really are incredible
trump, And they come right from the State of Pennsylvania
trump, Hey, do you ever notice where Biden keeps saying he's in the wrong state Like if he's in Ohio, It's great to be an Iowa tonight
trump, If he's in Pennsylvania, It's wonderful to be in the State of Delaware
trump, What is wrong with this guy What's wrong with him There's something wrong
trump, Okay There's something wrong
trump, No, he keeps … How many times can you do that So far, it could happen, because you know I was doing six and seven a day that last month, that last beautiful month that I loved, I was doing six
trump, I left these guys alone
trump, I didn't want to do interviews, they were a waste of time
trump, We just did these big beautiful rallies
trump, And you know, if you start getting a little … you know, I went to Michigan, then I went to Wisconsin, then I went … I'm sitting here saying, What the hell is going on These crowds are incredible
trump, And we had the biggest crowds
trump, By the way, to this day, there has never been, and they'll always correct me, in the history of politics, in the history of our country, there has never been anybody that drew crowds like we draw, and I don't have a guitar
trump, I have no guitar
trump, But this has never happened
trump, I mean if you took Ronald Reagan, and we all like Ronald Reagan, I liked him, I thought he was a great guy, but if he came to Pennsylvania for a rally, if he had 1,000 people in a ballroom or something, you know I mean we're getting crowds, 25-30,000 people, and then there'll be 20,000 people outside
trump, We set up screens outside, and if anybody would like to stand in the rain watching
trump, And do you people out there, I'm sorry, it's pretty rough
trump, But no, there's never been anything like it
trump, One instruction get me the biggest arena you can get
trump, We don't have empty seats
trump, I mean look at this
trump, How many seats is this 11,000 How much 10,500, it's packed
trump, It's beyond that
trump, And don't forget, look at the floor, and then you go out
trump, No, and then you go out and you look outside, and you have thousands and thousands because there's a spirit for what we're doing
trump, We're fixing our country, we're healing our country
trump, We're making America great again
trump, So I want to ask a couple of our great warriors to come forward
trump, Representative Glenn Thompson, come up here, Glenn
trump, Come up here
trump, A man that's been a friend of mine for a long time, Mike Kelly
trump, Don't get in the fight with Mike
trump, Come up, Mike
trump, A wonderful man who represents this area, Scott Perry
trump, Representative Lloyd Smucker

trump, So I just want to thank, this is an amazing group of people, and with their help, and the help of everyone here, we are going to set records like we've never set before
trump, You know, I used to say, and I sort of still have to say, 2016, I don't know if anything like that can ever happen, but I think we're much better
trump, All of the things I said, We're going to cut taxes
trump, We're going to cut regulations
trump, We're going to take care of our vets, look what we did for our vets, with choice, right Look what we did
trump, Look what we did
trump, We now have the ability to fire all of the bad people that are in the VA
trump, Right Fired over 8,000 people that were disrespecting our vets
trump, They wouldn't have done it in primetime, I can tell you that
trump, But what we've done for our vets, what we've done in rebuilding our military, what we've done in so many ways, and we, unlike the Democrats, will protect your Second Amendment
trump, Okay So we've done a job, and we're proud of it, and we have tremendous people
trump, Let's give them a hand, and thank you very much
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you, everybody
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you, folks
trump, Vote for these people
trump, Even if you don't like them, vote for them
trump, Oh, that's a beautiful new hat
trump, Look at the hat that guy's got on
trump, How's that hat working out Is that good I love that hat
trump, Look at this guy, that says Keep America Great
trump, Should we do the poll Should we do a poll Okay, ready So we have the greatest phrase in the history of politics, Make America Great Again
trump, Wait
trump, And we have our new phrase, because we've made America great
trump, I've told you, stock market, we've rebuilt our military, we've cut your taxes at a level that nobody could even think possible
trump, Take a look at your median income, take a look at what's happened
trump, The numbers, median household income, take a look at your numbers
trump, With President Bush, it went up 400 in eight years
trump, With President Obama, it went up 975 in eight years
trump, With President Trump, it went up 5,000, but whoa, whoa, whoa, in less than three years
trump, That's a big thing
trump, Wait
trump, And then when you add energy savings, and you add tax savings, you have almost a 10,000 gain in three years
trump, That's a big difference
trump, And that's one of the very big reasons why our, I think that and regulations, but that's one of the very big reasons why our economy is doing so well, because they talk about our consumer is loaded with money
trump, Thank you very much, Mr
trump, President, I appreciate it
trump, But with the help of everyone here, we have now the hottest economy
trump, You know when I meet dictators, and presidents, and kings, and queens, and prime ministers, they all come into that beautiful Oval Office
trump, So beautiful, right So respected
trump, And the first thing they almost always say, Sir, congratulations on your economy
trump, We're trying to do the same thing
trump, I said, You won't be able to do it
trump, You won't
trump, They won't be able to
trump, Let them give it a shot
trump, But they all say, Congratulations on the great job you've done with economy
trump, But we've all done the great job
trump, Not me
trump, We've all done it
trump, I've been your spokesman, and I've done a good job as spokesman
trump, But they all say that
trump, But we've done a good job in many ways
trump, You know, all of the promises that I made, I'm the only politician in history that I've actually kept more promises than I made
trump, Think of that
trump, In other words, I made here, like a thing like Right to Try, nobody talked about Right to Try
trump, We got Right to Try
trump, That's somebody terminally ill, we have the greatest medicines in the world, the greatest doctors, the greatest labs in the world, nobody close, but it takes years to get it approved
trump, And I got it approved so you can sign a document, get it
trump, If you want to see the lives that we're saving, it's a beautiful thing
trump, A beautiful thing is happening, Right to Try
trump, Right to Try
trump, But we've also created 7 million new jobs since the election
trump, If I would have said that, the fake news would have gone crazy, they would have said that's impossible
trump, These people would have gone crazy
trump, They go crazy anyway, and I don't even say it
trump, And right here in Pennsylvania, we've created 160, 000 brand new beautiful jobs, and you have companies moving in and moving back
trump, And as I said, African American, Hispanic American, Asian American unemployment, the lowest ever in the history of our country, the lowest unemployment rates
trump, Wages for low income workers have gone up more than 10
trump, Nobody thought that was possible
trump, They're one of the biggest, in terms of a group, one of the biggest beneficiaries
trump, This year, 40 million American families will benefit from the Republican Child Tax Credit, each receiving an average of 2,200
trump, We ended the last administration's war on American energy, the United States is now, and I said it, and I'll say it all night long, number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world, and there's nobody even close
trump, In the State of Pennsylvania, natural gas production is up 34 since our election, 34
trump, Virtually every leading Democrat has pledged to entirely eliminate American production of oil, clean coal, natural gas
trump, I don't think somebody coming into Pennsylvania, you know those new petrochemical plants, they don't like them at all
trump, Thousands and thousands of jobs
trump, Incredible
trump, Millions of dollars in taxes
trump, How about going to the State of Texas We had one candidate who turned out not to be too good a candidate, right Beto, Beto
trump, Remember So he wanted to get rid of religion, the Bible, he wanted to get rid of guns, and he wanted to get rid of oil
trump, How about going to Texas and say, No Bible, no oil, think of this one, No Bible, no oil, no guns
trump, I think you could be Abraham Lincoln and not win that particular race
trump, And it wouldn't be much different in the State of Pennsylvania, that I can tell you
trump, But you know, somebody that believes in that is Sleepy Joe Biden
trump, He was caught telling a far left radical activist that he would shut down fossil fuel production in Pennsylvania
trump, You saw that
trump, But the voters of this Commonwealth will never, ever let that happen
trump, Can you imagine a guy coming in, whether it's him or anybody else They all want to do it
trump, He just raises his hand, he has no clue what he's doing
trump, They raise their hand
trump, Remember he looked Do you want to give illegal aliens healthcare, even though we're taking it away from our own soldiers that are up … and he looks and they're all raising their hand Did you see that Well, he, Oh, oh, oh, okay, I'll do it too
trump, In addition to replacing NAFTA, I've taken the toughest ever action against China's trade abuses
trump, They want to make a deal so badly
trump, And we're doing well with the deal, but they want to make a deal
trump, Please make a deal
trump, We don't want to pay tariffs anymore
trump, Please, please
trump, Thanks to our steel tariffs, steel mills in Pennsylvania are roaring back to life
trump, And U
trump,S
trump, Steel has just announced 1 billion investment in Mon Valley Works in Pittsburgh
trump, You know that, right 1 billion
trump, They weren't investing, they were divesting
trump, The steel companies, it's an amazing achievement
trump, We tax all of the dumped steel, comes in from China and other places, 25
trump, … the dump steel comes in from China and other places
trump, 25
trump, All of it
trump, All of a sudden our steel mills are doing again
trump, We need steel
trump, It's not like you could say, Gee, we'll get it from another country
trump, We need that for defense
trump, We need it for our ships, we need it for our planes
trump, We need it
trump, We can't play games with steel
trump, After years of rebuilding other nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation
trump, Very importantly, in everything we do, we are putting America first
trump, Sorry
trump, We gave up on the globalist folks
trump, Let's build the world
trump, Let's forget about our country
trump, Let's just rebuild the world
trump, Or no issue have the Democrat politicians more thoroughly betrayed the American people than on the issue of immigration
trump, Far left politician… I mean, they're fighting me on the wall, you have no idea
trump, But we're building it and it's fine and we have the money coming in from the military
trump, I've got it from here, from there, from there
trump, Believe me, if I weren't a good developer, you could forget about that wall
trump, I've got here, there, there
trump, These people fought me and we've started winning in court
trump, You know what Speaking of court, we will soon have 182 federal judges, including Court of Appeals
trump, Nobody can believe it
trump, All because Barack Obama gave us 142 empty seats
trump, When you're a president, they always say, I disagree
trump, I think the most important thing we can do is defense, right But beyond defense, they always say the most important thing you can do is judges and justices of the Supreme Court
trump, We have two great ones
trump, Great ones
trump, But they always say, Judges and Supreme Court justices
trump, When you leave office, I hope in 5 years, 9 years, 13 years, 17 years, 21 years, 25 years, 29 years
trump, When I leave office… Now I'm only doing that to drive them totally crazy
trump, That drives them crazy
trump, Even joking about it
trump, We have this idiot comedian who stands up, he's talking to a guest, right He said, You know he's going to win, don't you You know it
trump, The guy goes, No, no
trump, We're going to fight
trump, We're going to fight
trump, And they will
trump, No, no, no
trump, You know he's going to win
trump, Then he goes, You know he's going to win
trump, And you know he's never leaving, don't you He's never leaving
trump, At first I thought he was kidding
trump, He's a whack job
trump, He is totally serious
trump, He honestly believes that
trump, I don't know, should we give it a shot Maybe we'll give it a shot
trump, I'm only kidding
trump, I'm only kidding
trump, Media, I'm only kidding
trump, They won't write that, but that's okay
trump, They won't write the, I'm only kidding part
trump, But far left politicians support deadly sanctuary cities demonstrating their sneering contempt, scorned and disdained for everyday Americans
trump, These jurisdictions deliberately release dangerous, violent, criminal aliens out of their jails and directly onto your streets, where they are free to offend, where they are free to kill, where they are free to rape, where they are free to beat up people except for ICE because ICE is much tougher than them
trump, They don't beat up ICE
trump, They don't beat up ICE
trump, You're lucky we have ICE
trump, They want to put ICE out of business
trump, That's not happening
trump, ICE is… They're incredible people
trump, They're great patriots and they're tough
trump, Thanks to Democrat immigration policies, innocent Americans in all 50 states are being brutalized and murdered by illegal alien criminals
trump, Last summer, at least 19 illegal aliens were charged in connection with grizzly homicides, including hacking victims to death and ripping out, in two cases, their hearts
trump, Weeks ago, two illegal aliens and members of the savage gang, MS-13, who we are removing from our country by the thousands, were charged with relentlessly beating a wonderful, beautiful high school teenager to death with a baseball bat and chopping the body apart with a machete
trump, One of the animals accused was previously released by local authorities in defiance of an ICE demand
trump, ICE warned and said, You can't let them go
trump, They wanted them
trump, They would do anything for them
trump, They wanted them to hand this animal over for deportation back to his country
trump, Get them the hell out of our country, right Democrats' sanctuary cities also give safe haven to those who commit violent sex crimes
trump, Since Montgomery County, Maryland declared itself a sanctuary jurisdiction in July, we have already identified nine illegal aliens who have been arrested for rape, sexual assault, including a 26-year-old man charged with raping and viciously strangling a young, wonderful woman who was entering her apartment, innocently entering her apartment
trump, She was raped and killed, strangled to death
trump, Sanctuary city
trump, Maryland
trump, But these are only the cases we know about
trump, Sanctuary cities and jails actively conceal illegal alien crime and criminals from federal government
trump, Federal government wants to take them out, or in some cases, if it's real violence, and we don't want to pay for the cost, but we do, put them into very strong jails
trump, The sanctuary city of Philadelphia
trump, The sanctuary city in Philadelphia is one of the very worst sanctuaries anywhere in America
trump, Did you know that I mean, I know Philadelphia well
trump, Going to school here, we never heard about sanctuary cities, did we Weeks ago an illegal alien charged with rape, sexual assault of a child, and inflicting serious bodily injury was released by Philadelphia to wander free in your communities
trump, By the way, you may have the worst district attorney or whatever the hell you call it
trump, This guy, I've been hearing about this guy, he lets killers out almost immediately
trump, What the hell How did you let that happen Instead of handing them over while still in jail, they defied ICE
trump, They fought with ICE and set him loose upon an unsuspecting family
trump, Thankfully, at great time and effort, our brave ICE officers were eventually able to track him down, arrest him, detain him, and do what has to be done
trump, How do you elect Democrats when they create a sanctuary city of Philadelphia I don't get it
trump, Four MS-13 gang members were also arrested in Pennsylvania in connection with the brutal and sadistic murders of a 21-year-old and a 15-year-old
trump, As we speak, a criminal illegal alien with three prior deportations is roaming free in Pennsylvania because he was released by the city of Philadelphia, the city of brotherly love
trump, You better get yourself a new prosecutor in this place, I want to tell you
trump, That's a horrible thing
trump, No, it's a national story, how he wants everybody to not pay the price
trump, You're talking about not paying the price for rape, for murder, for other horrible crimes
trump, How stupid can you be The charges against this alien include rape, aggravated indecent assault, unlawful contact with a minor, indecent exposure, and terroristic threats
trump, Other than that, he was a very nice person
trump, Philadelphia has defied ICE and released illegals charged with everything from assault, to kidnapping, to drug crimes, to sex crimes, to homicide murder
trump, Democrats stand for crime, corruption, and chaos
trump, Republicans stand for law and order, and we stand for justice
trump, We stand for justice
trump, We side with law enforcement and with law-abiding Americans, not ruthless gang members and not violent criminals, aliens that come into our country illegally
trump, They take our payments
trump, Payments
trump, Some of these people with these crazy laws that you have
trump, Look at what's going on in California
trump, They do better than our great veterans
trump, They do better than citizens of our country
trump, And they advertise, We will take you
trump, We will take care of you
trump, We will pay for it
trump, And then you wonder why we have so many people trying to come through at the borders
trump, But we do a great job
trump, We're removing these criminal illegal aliens from our country by the thousands
trump, We're sending them home, and we're not letting them come back in
trump, We're being very tough
trump, Mexico is now giving us 27,000 soldiers at our border
trump, And Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, we signed a very important agreement with each
trump, When their people come into our country, they weren't taking them back
trump, Now they take them back and they say, Thank you very much
trump, They weren't taking them back
trump, If we had a murderer from Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, we want to bring them back under past administrations
trump, They bring them and they say, We don't want them
trump, Don't land
trump, You're playing with us
trump, They say, Thank you very much
trump, We will take them back
trump, Because we've let them know the price is very bad if they don't do that
trump, Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, illegal crossings are down 75 since May and the wall is going up at a very rapid pace
trump, The radical Democrats have gotten more and more extreme
trump, That's why they did this impeachment hoax, because Nancy Pelosi had absolutely no control
trump, She knew what was going to happen
trump, She knew
trump, The radical left has taken over the Democrat party
trump, Democrats are pushing for a socialist takeover of healthcare that would strip you of the doctor and coverage of your choice
trump, We have 180 million people with private healthcare that love it
trump, They're going to take it away from you
trump, I don't think so
trump, Crazy Elizabeth Warren, or as I affectionately call her, Pocahontas, her ridiculous plan would cost 52 trillion
trump, That's more money than we take in in one year, two years, three years, four years, five years, six years, about seven years
trump, That's for one year
trump, 52 trillion
trump, And you don't have your doctor
trump, I mean, the whole… Well, she's starting to crash again
trump, I thought I knocked her down
trump, I did that heavy, heavy Pocahontas deal
trump, I give her credit
trump, I thought she was left for… I mean, there were just little embers, and then she rose
trump, She rose, then she became strong
trump, But then she opened that fresh mouth of hers and it stopped
trump, It stopped
trump, I don't see her as a threat
trump, I don't think she makes it
trump, I mean, you don't know
trump, Crazy things are happening in the Democrat party
trump, It used to be a sane party
trump, Now it's an insane party
trump, So you don't know
trump, But they're all looking at the same thing
trump, I mean, you have Alfred E
trump, Neuman who's running, who's this guy
trump, This guy Buttigieg
trump, Buttigieg
trump, Can you believe he's doing well He's like the leading fundraiser
trump, I dream about him
trump, It's true
trump, No, Buttigieg
trump, But I'm not going too far with any of these people because I thought I was way too early with Elizabeth Warren
trump, We destroyed her too fast
trump, So she came back
trump, But she's going back down again
trump, Did anybody see her beer deal where she said, Darling
trump, Did you ever see that deal Darling
trump, It's about her husband
trump, Darling, it's great to see you
trump, What are you doing here It's like, That's her husband, he's supposed to be living in the house
trump, You're here
trump, I don't think she's seen him in 10 years
trump, Hey, I have an idea
trump, Can I get a beer Let's get a beer
trump, She wants to be one of the group
trump, Hey, let's get a beer
trump, Did you ever see such a phony, disgusting deal Republicans will defend your sacred right to choose the doctor, and you can choose your plan, and you choose the plan that's right for you
trump, We will strongly protect patients with preexisting conditions
trump, We will also protect your right to get the physician that you want
trump, Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb, right up until the moment of birth
trump, This character in Virginia
trump, Did you see the Virginia governor I mean, he gave a whole expose
trump, The baby is born, and then basically, they start talking to the mother
trump, The baby is born
trump, And there's no other word
trump, If the mother decides no, then they execute the baby
trump, Okay He's the governor of Virginia and why the Republicans aren't going to win Virginia this next election, 2020
trump, I'll tell you what, we're going to give it a very strong shot
trump, When you have people like that, we're going to give it a very strong shot
trump, But that's why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion
trump, Because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God
trump, Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption
trump, The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and the party of honest Abe Lincoln
trump, Party of Abe Lincoln
trump, I told you about judges
trump, I'm telling you about so many other things
trump, There's nobody that's ever done what we're doing
trump, You look at school choice for every child in America who needs it, including the 50,000 Pennsylvania students who your Democrat governor has blocked from getting school choice scholarships
trump, No scholarships available
trump, What's that all about How did that happen I withdrew from the horrible, one-sided Iran nuclear deal, a disaster
trump, I recognize Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem
trump, For years you watched as your politicians apologized for America
trump, Now you have a president who is standing up for America, and we are standing up for the people of Pennsylvania
trump, You've never had that better year
trump, Never At stake in our present battle is the survival of the American nation itself
trump, It's the survival
trump, We will destroy our country if these people get in
trump, I say we've done so much in the first three years, will soon be four years
trump, All of a sudden the time will be up
trump, But it's like when you plant a tree, it needs time to grab on
trump, It needs time to let it… It's got to grab
trump, That's what we need
trump, We need time
trump, And we have other things we're going to do that are incredible
trump, We still have tremendous regulation cutting that we can do
trump, We've cut more regulations than any president in the history of our country
trump, We did it in less than two and a half years
trump, Two and a half years
trump, We did it in less than two and a half years
trump, Some had eight years, one had more than eight years
trump, More regulation
trump, And we have regulation, and you need some regulation, but you don't need regulation that doesn't allow you to build a simple road or highway
trump, So what we've done has been incredible
trump, That's one of the reasons our job numbers are so good
trump, If you want your children to inherit the birthright of American Liberty that generations of Americans have fought and died for to secure, then we must devote everything we have toward victory in 2020, and we have to get rid of the Democrats in the House of Representatives
trump, They are stone cold crazy
trump, Only this way can we save the America we love and clean up Washington corruption once and for all
trump, With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity
trump, We have tremendous prosperity going on in our country, and the people in this room are… I mean, you know what's happening
trump, You know what's happening with your families
trump, You know what's happening with your jobs
trump, You've never had a time like this
trump, They always say, Are you better off now than you were four years ago I mean, who is better off now Everybody, I think
trump, Everybody
trump, But together, we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration
trump, We will enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase, Made in the USA
trump, We just finished a deal with South Korea, a great new trade deal
trump, We just finished a 40 billion deal with Japan
trump, We're in the process of getting our deal done
trump, Let's see what happens
trump, They want to make it more than I do with because we're taking in a lot of money
trump, We haven't taken in money from China ever, and it's coming in now by the billions
trump, When they target our farmer, I give our farmers that money that they've been targeted and our farmers are thrilled
trump, We have a lot leftover, but we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer, and ending the AIDS epidemic in America
trump, We'll have that done within 10 years
trump, It could have started
trump, That could have started earlier than the beginning of our administration
trump, We'll have that done in less than 10 years
trump, Think of that
trump, The AIDS epidemic will have ended in America within less than 10 years
trump, We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms
trump, Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America, one great country
trump, One America
trump, We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States
trump, We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement
trump, We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life
trump, We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the true American way
trump, We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag
trump, And we live by the words of our national motto, In God we trust
trump, We stand on the shoulders of generations of Pennsylvania patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation
trump, Pennsylvania's the place where our founding fathers declared American independence, where the army weathered its brutal winter at Valley Forge, and where General George Washington led his men across the Delaware on Christmas night
trump, They used the password
trump, You know what the password was Victory or death
trump, Victory or death
trump, How incredible is that Victory or death
trump, Pennsylvania is the state that gave us self-made titans of American industry, from Andrew Carnegie to Milton Hershey
trump, I love Hershey
trump, I love Hershey
trump, And Henry J
trump, Heinz
trump, Pennsylvania is the place where strong American workers mine the coal, work the railroads, and forge the steel that made America into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of the world, and we are making it even greater every single day
trump, It's greater than ever before
trump, And proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country
trump, We are returning power to you, the American people
trump, They are trying to take your power away
trump, It will never ever happen
trump, With your help, and with your devotion, and your drive we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning
trump, We are going to keep on winning
trump, We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God
trump, America is thriving like never before
trump, Ladies and gentlemen of Pennsylvania, the best is yet to come
trump, Because together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again
trump, Thank you, Pennsylvania
trump, Thank you
trump,
trump,Well, thank you very much
trump, And hello Las Vegas

trump, We've won it
trump, I like it that better
trump, You know they say they're going to have a lot of problems tomorrow
trump, I hate to tell you this
trump, I don't know
trump, Have you heard I hear their computers are all messed up
trump, Just like they were in Iowa
trump, They're not going to be able to count their vote
trump, They're going to tell you about healthcare
trump, They're going to tell you about our military and the jet fighters and the missiles and rockets, but they can't count votes
trump, They just can't count them
trump, They can't count votes, but they're saying they may not be able to do it again
trump, They're still trying to tell us
trump, I called up yesterday, how are they doing in Iowa Was that two weeks ago They say we're getting close
trump, They're not getting close, they'll never know
trump, They'll never know, but I hear the same thing could happen tomorrow
trump, I hope it doesn't, actually
trump, I hope it doesn't, but I'm delighted to be back in a state I love
trump, I have a beautiful building right down the road
trump, With the proud, hardworking patriots of Nevada
trump, You're going to say Nevada
trump, You say that wrong, you got problems
trump, You say Nevada, they go, what the hell Got to be Nevada
trump, With your help this November, we're going to defeat the radical socialist Democrats and we are going to win Nevada in a big beautiful landslide
trump, Now, we have some special people here, you know the special very special people
trump, And we celebrate one of the greatest moments in the history of sports
trump, Some people say it was the single greatest moment in the history of sports
trump, It was called the miracle on ice
trump, Do you remember that That was when the Russians had a team assembled
trump, That was probably, they say maybe the greatest team ever assembled
trump, They were unbelievable
trump, And our guys played a practice game with them was it a couple of weeks before, and I hate to tell you the score was 10 to 3, and the USA was not on top, and this team was an incredible team and they went in and it was amazing, but tomorrow marks the 40 years since the United States men's hockey team defeated then Soviet Union team in the 1980 Olympics
trump, Incredible
trump, That was incredible
trump, Most of you remember that
trump, I'm looking
trump, We've got a lot of young ones, but we've got a lot of people that remember that
trump, A lot of people
trump, And by the way, we got the Olympics coming back or coming to Los Angeles
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you President Trump
trump, Thank you President Trump
trump, Thank you very much

trump, I said, what's that all about The movie was made in South Korea
trump, Look, I get along great with South Korea, but you know, I never saw that one before

trump, I don't get it, but that's what it used to be and this is really an incredible time

trump, Nobody can do it like us
trump, We're the greatest country in the world again
trump, We have the greatest people
trump, We have the greatest military by far
trump, We've totally rebuilt our military
trump, Jobs are booming, incomes are surging, poverty is plummeting
trump, Factories are returning confidence is soaring, like these guys, the confidence is soaring, but you know, we do have somebody that I'd like to point out because this team is, they had a coach, and that coach was a very inspirational coach, would you say Mike And I'd like to have maybe one of you come up and just say a few words about Coach Brooks because he was very, very, he was really a big, he was a big heart on this team

trump, Thank you very much
trump, Thanks Kelly

trump, Greatest sports story could be number one
trump, So a lot of people, a lot of these sports experts, sports writers have voted that as the single greatest sporting event or athletic achievement
trump, I think so, yeah They put it number one, certainly top five
trump, In the history of our country, we have a lot of things that we've done to break records
trump, We're going to go over them, but we've broken a lot of records now, but I want to thank that great team for being with us
trump, Very inspirational
trump, This is a big day
trump, The anniversary
trump, Thank you fellas
trump, Thank you
trump, In my state of the union address, I proudly declare that we are in the midst of the great American comeback and we're just getting started
trump, After three years of ridiculous witch hunts and partisan Democrat crusades
trump, By the way, I think they're starting another one
trump, Did you see that I see these phoneys
trump, These are the do nothing Democrats
trump, They said today that Putin wants to be sure that Trump gets elected
trump, Here we go again
trump, Here we go again
trump, Did you see it A story
trump, Aren't people bored Now, does that include because a couple of weeks ago, crooked Hillary said Chelsea Gabbard, right
trump, Tulsi Gabbard and right She was a Russian agent
trump, Tulsi and also Stein from Jill Stein
trump, I don't know Jill Stein
trump, I never met the woman
trump, She is a Green Party candidate or was they said she's an agent of Russia
trump, I don't know her and I don't know Tulsi
trump, The only thing I know about both of them is they're not agent
trump, They are not agents of Russia
trump, These people are sick
trump, That's pencil neck, pencil neck again
trump, Little pencil
trump, No, I just see it again
trump, I was told that was happening
trump, I was told a week ago
trump, They said they're trying to start a rumor
trump, It's disinformation
trump, That's the only thing they're good at
trump, They're not good at anything else
trump, They get nothing done
trump, Do nothing Democrats
trump, That Putin wants to make sure get elected
trump, Listen to this
trump, So doesn't he want to see who the Democrat's going to be Wouldn't you rather have, let's say Bernie Wouldn't he rather that Bernie who honeymooned in Moscow Wouldn't that be These people are crazy
trump, That's all they think about
trump, They don't think about the country
trump, They don't think about jobs
trump, They don't think about lowering your drug costs
trump, Infrastructure
trump, These people are crazy
trump, Trust me, I like what we're doing and I love this country
trump, I love this country
trump, Now, and I campaigned on it, at the same time we want to get along with Russia, we want to get along with China, we want to get along with all these countries
trump, Who the hell needs to have conflict But these people are sick, they are sick people
trump, The radical left's attempts to poison our democracy and overturn the last election have totally ended in a big fat failure
trump, And by the way, you saw today, single best day I've ever had is the polls and any poll that the fake news gives you, because the real numbers are higher, but any poll they give you as a fake
trump, But Wisconsin, the great state of Wisconsin, I was leading by many, many, many points against every one of these characters
trump, Can you believe it We got a new one
trump, Mini Mike
trump, How did he do in the debate the other day Mini Mike
trump, Here's a box Mike
trump, Here Mike
trump, Mini Mike
trump, He was a beauty
trump, What happened huh He couldn't breathe
trump, What happened Mike would like to know how about that Pocahontas screaming at him
trump, She forgot
trump, She forgot that she lied about her own heritage
trump, She said she was an Indian because she had high cheekbones
trump, That was the only thing
trump, Remember what I said, I have more Indian blood in me than she has and I have none
trump, Right I have none
trump, To the best of my knowledge, wouldn't mind having some, but I happen to have none
trump, And she choked and she went out and got a report done
trump, One, 1 thousandth and 24 you know what that means That means probably I do have more
trump, Now why did he bring that up when she was screaming at him Why Because he was gasping for breath
trump, I can't breathe
trump, I can't breathe
trump, She's hitting me too hard
trump, Pocahontas
trump, Well, she won that debate cause Mike could not respond
trump, That's what they all said
trump, They all said that
trump, That's funny
trump, I won, they're all shouting
trump, It's not me that's saying it
trump, Fake news
trump, You fake news people
trump, No, they all said it though
trump, Who won the debate Trump
trump, You know what The way I look at it, when fake news CNN oops, there goes the camera off
trump, Red light just went off
trump, See, I can tell every one of them
trump, I know them by heart
trump, I know the operators
trump, I know the camera men
trump, They're okay
trump, They're all on our side by the way
trump, They're screamed at
trump, Get that camera off
trump, I don't want to do that
trump, Get that camera off, or it's going to be you job
trump, All right, I'm sorry
trump, Precedent
trump, But how bout MSDNC They're worse than CNN
trump, And they're owned by people that really are bad
trump, I think they're very bad for our country
trump, The owners of Comcast, rotten company, bad for our country, very bad
trump, They try, they have all these PR things to try and keep their image nice and clean
trump, What they do on television is so disgusting
trump, I think in the old days you had to have licenses for this stuff, right They can say whatever they want to say
trump, Let's see what happens over the next period of time
trump, Bunch of dishonest people
trump, Comcast, terrible company
trump, Terrible people running that company
trump, And you know what, I had Celebrity Apprentice, I had the Apprentice on for 14 seasons, 14 seasons, and they used to come to my office and they would kiss my ass
trump, Please sign
trump, Please
trump, Please sign
trump, It's an interesting story
trump, They came and we signed, you know who signed me, Jeff Zucker
trump, It's one of the only things he's done good in broadcasting, but I signed and NBC, as you know, is owned by Comcast, but I signed and they figured the show would be a total failure
trump, So they only signed me for one season
trump, You know I was going to have it
trump, It was go on and then the show goes, started at ten went to eight, went to seven, went to five, went to four, went to two
trump, It went to one
trump, I had the number one show in all of television
trump, Number one
trump, It was a phenomenal and the final episode, remember that With the, you remember that Do you remember the final We had, I don't know, it was one of the biggest shows of the year
trump, It was a tremendous success there
trump, But here I was, I signed with NBC and they didn't even want to waste the ink on an option
trump, Usually they have an option for not, you know, just like they didn't do it
trump, You stupid people
trump, So they paid me very little for the first season I think 25,000 a show, which is considered not good
trump, That's okay
trump, It was fun
trump, I didn't know it was going to be success, you know Hey, just like this was successful
trump, It's a recent
trump, Because when I left and Arnold Schwarzenegger and I like Arnold said some very nice things, so I'm not, but the show did not exactly succeed when I left, but I had it on and they wanted me to sign for more and I said, no, I'm going to run for president but I'll never forget
trump, I looked at, I didn't know anything about this business and I had an agent, wonderful guy from William Morris, and he said, sir, I don't want you to sign
trump, No business show has ever done well on network television
trump, Well, it's not business, it's entertainment, celebrity
trump, Sir, I don't want you to sign
trump, Sir, don't sign
trump, I said, yeah, okay
trump, But I have a problem
trump, I shook the hand of somebody I have to
trump, And Mark Burnett was great
trump, He was my guy and but we shook hands
trump, So I have to, but I agreed, you know, I didn't know that no business or no business type show had ever succeeded on a network television
trump, So he said, I don't want you to sign sir, break it
trump, I said, I can't break it
trump, Can't break it
trump, Anyway, so the show I said started at ten, went to nine, went to became, it was the number one show all of a sudden, and the agent called me up and he said, sir, I remember it was six in the morning
trump, I was in bed
trump, He said, sir, the show just went to number one
trump, I'd love to see you because I think I'm entitled to more money
trump, I said, you didn't want me to do the show
trump, Well, not really
trump, I mean, I was okay
trump, He said, I'd really like more money
trump, I said, Jim, I like you very much, Jim, you're fired
trump, Get out
trump, Anyway, I had 14 great seasons over about 11 years because it was so successful, they kept… They would have run it
trump, Remember when they did the three hours, the whole night was the Apprentice
trump, I said, wait a minute
trump, Gone With the Wind, to mention the movie a second time, Gone With the Wind is shorter
trump, They had the Apprentice on for three hours
trump, I said even I think it's too long
trump, You can't put it up for three
trump, You got leave a little bit like I want to come back next week
trump, But they had it on for three weeks
trump, We did fantastically with it
trump, Comcast did great
trump, NBC did great
trump, They wanted me to sign for another three years
trump, I said, no, I'm going to for president
trump, And that was actually the time when I knew I was going to run
trump, Because you know how they were paying a lot of money and whether you're rich or not, it's still a lot of money
trump, I don't care how rich you are
trump, It's a lot
trump, Millions and millions of dollars
trump, And I said no, I'm going to run for president
trump, And I did that
trump, But from the day I ran, they went from being, you know one… But from the day I ran, they went from being wonderful, they were nice
trump, They were nice
trump, I guess if I didn't do well with the show they wouldn't have been nice because they weren't nice to other people that failed
trump, People that didn't have good ratings, that business is a very simple business
trump, If you have good ratings, you can treat them like garbage
trump, If you have bad ratings, you can say, Sir, I really respect you so much
trump, Get out of here
trump, Get him out of my yard
trump, They're very ruthless people
trump, But Comcast is a rotten company
trump, They forgot totally
trump, And they are worse than CNN
trump, I will tell you that right now
trump, Comcast is worse than CNN
trump, We should call it Comcast, because that's their beautiful maiden name, Comcast
trump, They're worse than CNN
trump, I'll, tell you something about CNN
trump, Jake Tapper, today he put out… Now I know you don't like him
trump, I know
trump, Who likes him Who the hell can like him I think his wife likes him
trump, Actually
trump, I really believe she does
trump, But let me just tell you, he put out a couple of social media posts today, because I never call it tweet, I call it social media because it's much bigger than tweet
trump, What we have, Dan Scavino
trump, The great Dan Scavino
trump, We have won five sites
trump, We're number one on Twitter, we're number one on Facebook, and the whole world
trump, The whole world
trump, So it's powerful
trump, But Jake Tapper put out some things, basically saying, I believe it, that's the way I read it, that the new Russian thing that started yesterday, that Putin wants to be sure that Trump, which give me a break
trump, Give me a break
trump, But Jake Tapper said it ain't so, and if he did say that because they were a little complex, they can turn them around, or when Zucker sees him and said, Why did you put that I want that deleted and I want you to do a different one
trump, But he did say that
trump, So I respect that because it's another hoax story
trump, But we're standing up for the defense of our constitution, for our freedom, and democracy itself
trump, You know that
trump, I got to get that
trump, Hey, Bobby Bobby See that guy I love that shirt
trump, Bobby, I don't know
trump, He looks like a nice guy
trump, Can you please walk him up, even if you have about five
trump, Come here, come here
trump, Come here
trump, Come here
trump, You got to see this shirt
trump, You got to see this shirt
trump, I love it
trump, I've got to order me one that I can ride around
trump, Come on
trump, Come on up here
trump, He looks safe
trump, He doesn't look like he's going to start a fist fight
trump, He's a good fan, I guess
trump, You got to see this shirt
trump, I love it
trump, Is there any place that's more fun than a Trump rally Right How many rallies have you been to 80 80 80
trump, He said 80 rallies
trump, Come up here
trump, Come on
trump, Come on
trump, Come on
trump, Look at these two guys
trump, These guys are serious
trump, These are serious fans, right Are you with him Are you with him Are you with him You're with him Come on
trump, Come up here
trump, Man
trump, And look at this guy Come on
trump, Thank you, fellas
trump, Wow
trump, I just said, How long have you two been together I figured they'd say, We're married
trump, He met her at the rally in Colorado
trump, Can you believe this Can you believe it Man, did he get lucky
trump, They both got lucky, right They both got lucky
trump, Well, that's cool
trump, No, I just see there's so much stuff out here
trump, It's genius, actually
trump, While the extreme left has been wasting America's time with viral hoaxes, we've been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, enacting fair trade deals, securing our border, lifting up citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed
trump, As you heard, we added another 225,000 new jobs last month alone
trump, Way above anticipated schedule
trump, And that makes 7 million new jobs since the election
trump, The number was supposed to be under 2 million and we added 7 million
trump, And remember, if I give you wrong numbers, the fake news is going to have headlines
trump, Trump gave you wrong… I mean, it's very tough
trump, I've got to be very careful
trump, Even if I give you wrong in the wrong way, they'll say it was wrong
trump, I said, Yeah, but it was wrong in the low way
trump, No, that's no good either
trump, Got to be very precise with these characters
trump, The Democrats don't have to be, but we have to be
trump, We've destroyed he ISIS territorial caliphate 100, we killed the founder and leader of ISIS
trump, Al Baghdadi is dead
trump, Al Baghdadi is dead
trump, 17 years
trump, They looked for him
trump, 17 years
trump, Al-Baghdadi
trump, One of the first things I did when I came in
trump, He's the founder of ISIS and when I came in three years ago, ISIS was all over the place
trump, And I said, You got to knock it out
trump, We knocked it out of Syria, and, Iraq and other places
trump, We really knocked at 100
trump, Remember I wanted to leave
trump, I said, All right
trump, We were at 96, then 98, then 99
trump, I said, Let some of these other countries do it
trump, Wouldn't you say, right So what happened is I wanted to leave and they said, No, no, no, we want 100
trump, So we wait and stayed
trump, We got 100, then we moved them all out of Syria, except we did keep the oil
trump, You noticed that, right We kept the oil
trump, Sorry
trump, They said, He left soldiers in Syria
trump, Yeah, I did to keep the oil, if you don't mind
trump, Which is what we should have done in Iraq too, by the way
trump, I would have done that
trump, I'm making a lot of money with all that oil
trump, But you remember that whole thing, that whole… I said, You got to find Al Baghdadi
trump, I've been saying that actually for two years
trump, I had a lot of other things to do the first year, like fight off the Democrats
trump, These crazy Democrats with their hoaxes
trump, Think of it
trump, If they use their genius, because they are genius at that stuff, right They're really good
trump, They can take nothing
trump, They can take a perfect phone call made to the Ukrainian president who said very specifically there was no pressure
trump, He doesn't even know what's going on and they can take this perfect call
trump, Thank goodness I had a transcriber
trump, Do you agree with it Because the fake whistleblower said that the call was totally different than what the call was
trump, So when I released the call, when I released the transcripts, they died
trump, They said, Oh we got a problem
trump, They never thought I was going to do it, but I had no choice
trump, I had to because I had to show they're liars
trump, But think of it, they can take something like that, a perfect phone call, or they'll take just out of thin air they can make something up
trump, And they ended up today, front page, New York Times
trump, They used to call it the eighth column
trump, That's the big column on the right
trump, I don't know
trump, The papers become so small
trump, I don't know if they have an eighth column anymore
trump, They used to have the eighth column, was a big deal, right That was the big deal
trump, Today it's too narrow
trump, Think they're probably… After I'm gone, they won't have any columns
trump, That's why eventually they're going to support me
trump, Eventually, the Times and the Washington post, which will be dead as a doornail after I leave, and the CNN, it'll be an obsolete business, the cable business
trump, MSDNC will be out of business
trump, You know, cable was supposed to be obsolete and now they're doing the highest numbers they've ever done
trump, If an airplane goes down with 700 people, they don't cover it
trump, If it's not Trump related, they don't cover it
trump, It's got to be Trump or Trump related
trump, So if a plane goes down and it's total devastation, if the ship goes down, if the Titanic- If the Titanic equivalent went down, they wouldn't cover it unless I was on the sucker
trump, It's true
trump, They wouldn't cover it
trump, The fake news would not cover the equivalent of the Titanic
trump, But you know what they're going to do before the election They're going to say, We want to just say something
trump, We're going to endorse the president
trump, You know why Because they'll be out of business
trump, Can you imagine if they had to cover mini Mike Who I don't think, I think he's gone, but you know what He'll spend another 500 million
trump, Don't forget I spent 70 and I won, of my money
trump, In other words, they said, and this was in the New York Times, I said the other night in Colorado
trump, I spent 70, mini Mike so far has spent almost 500 million dollars in order to get embarrassed by Pocahontas
trump, Pocahontas
trump, And she's mean, isn't she Did you see that Do you see the anger on her face That nervous energy
trump, She's jumping up and down
trump, She's a mess
trump, But no, no, she's mean
trump, Right Right That face is just… You want to get him She said, I got him
trump, I want to see those agreements
trump, I, You open up those agreements
trump, This poor guy probably signed a hundred of them and each one's a disaster
trump, He said, I don't want to open those agreements
trump, Nobody told me this was going to happen
trump, Said, Actually, sir
trump, Nobody told me
trump, Get me out of here
trump, After the debate, he went backstage, fired a lot of people
trump, He said, How the hell did you get me into this thing But Pocahontas was really mean, but she's going to be easy
trump, I hope it's her
trump, It's not going to be her
trump, Can't be, I don't think
trump, Alfred E
trump, Neuman, ladies and gentlemen, introducing president Alfred E
trump, Neuman
trump, Nobody knows because you're all too young
trump, Nobody knows who Alfred… it's Mad Magazine
trump, They all said… No
trump, Howdy Doody
trump, See nobody knows who Alfred E
trump, Neuman is
trump, Only the real aficionados
trump, They're the ones and they love it
trump, But that's only 15 of the crowd, right Am I right Better than Howdy Doody
trump, Howdy Doody
trump, And that's what happens when you can't get the words out
trump, No it does
trump, That's what happens, right When you can't get the words out, you get angry
trump, You get angry because you can't get the words
trump, That might happen to me someday
trump, Can you imagine if that happened to me Man, would I be a bad guy
trump, I'd be the meanest man in history
trump, No, but Biden is very angry
trump, He gets angrier, and angrier, and angrier
trump, He's changed
trump, And then you have the Tom
trump, Yeah
trump, He said Tom Steyer
trump, Tom said,  Mister impeachment
trump, How did that work out, Tom Thank you very much for the great poll numbers between him and nervous dancing
trump, How did that work out This schmuck spends 250 million dollars, he ends up with one third of a percent in Iowa
trump, But maybe that could be Rick, because they still don't have any idea what he got
trump, Maybe he won Iowa, they took it away from him
trump, No, but he was substantially below it
trump, All I know, it said 1 and an arrow left
trump, So he spends 250 million, Tom Steyer
trump, Never heard of this guy
trump, Who is he Where did he get his money Who is he He was in the coal business, did you know that This guy, this phony is a big environmentalist
trump, He made his money, a lot of it, in the coal business
trump, Nobody knows that, but he's a fake
trump, Remember when he walked up to Bernie the other day
trump, Hi Bernie
trump, Hi
trump, Oh, and he was having a fight with Pocahontas, right Is this the greatest Mark Burnett said, This is the greatest reality show in history
trump, He said, You can take The Apprentice, and you can take Survivor, and you can take every other reality show ever made, multiply it times 10,000, and you still don't have what we have
trump, And even the CAS
trump, He did say this
trump, You got the perfect president
trump, You got the perfect first lady
trump, How about the first lady You got the perfect kids
trump, The kids, though
trump, Those beautiful kids
trump, My beautiful kids
trump, They had such a great life, before I did this
trump, Sorry, kids
trump, Sorry
trump, My beautiful Ivanka
trump, She had such a great life
trump, She Had a company that was selling shoes and everything you could sell
trump, She'd just put her name on it and she said, Daddy, does it matter I want to come to Washington and help people get jobs
trump, Right Ain't that true And she left the company
trump, And when you leave a company, all of a sudden it doesn't do as well
trump, I wouldn't say that I exactly helped talking about the wall and other things, but she left the company, came to Washington and she said 500,000 jobs
trump, That was her goal
trump, And she did that in the first month
trump, She actually did
trump, She's gotten these great companies like Walmart, and many others, Exxon, she's gotten them to take millions of people
trump, She's now over 15 million jobs where they train people and bring them into the companies
trump, It's incredible
trump, 15 million
trump, And she's smart
trump, She got it figured out, but most people can't, but she does
trump, But all they do is give them heat
trump, They work so hard
trump, And could you imagine you take Biden's son
trump, Can you imagine But you know what We don't do any of that stuff
trump, We don't do that stuff
trump, We don't do it
trump, The kid got 3 million dollars, 83,000 a month and he didn't have a job until his father became vice president
trump, And speaking of vice presidents and speaking also of reality television, because it's the greatest show of all time, right Look at us
trump, Look
trump, We told you, what, last night Little change here, folks
trump, We're going to move it up from eight o'clock in the evening until 12 o'clock in the afternoon
trump, Little change
trump, Just a minor change
trump, Because I have to get back to Washington to work
trump, I feel guilty
trump, This is too much fun
trump, But speaking to vice presidents and speaking of perfect vice presidents, if you become president, the first thing you have to do is choose a really horrible, horrible vice president
trump, So if the idiots ever want to impeach you, they have to say, I can't impeach him
trump, Look who we have
trump, I have the perfect vice president
trump, I have the greatest in the world
trump, I have the greatest vice president
trump, I don't know
trump, I got the great ones
trump, I said, I can't do that
trump, I picked a great guy
trump, He's done a fantastic job
trump, He's been a great vice president
trump, But it is true
trump, I could have picked, I'll give you names, but don't want to do that because I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings
trump, But there are plenty of them out there
trump, They're mostly out there and I don't want to do that
trump, But Mike Pence has been great
trump, But tell me, is it perfect casting the whole thing And this isn't about casting, this is about real life
trump, But when Mark Burnett said to me the other day, he said, The greatest reality show of all times, times of million
trump, That's exactly except for one thing, we work our asses off and we are doing things like nobody has ever done before
trump, Right Right So, we took out Al Baghdadi and then we just took out two weeks ago the world's top terrorist, Qasem Soleimani of Iran, ending his evil reign of terror forever
trump, He's the father of the roadside bomb
trump, When you see our beautiful people walking around with no legs, they're walking, and trying to walk so hard, and they're really in rough shape he's the father of the… he loved the roadside bomb
trump, He thought it was a great thing
trump, Where is he now Soleimani
trump, And I'll tell you what, you know who's happy about it The people of Iran are happy and even the leaders of Iran, because the leaders of Iran were afraid of him
trump, Okay And the fact is, America is respected again
trump, We're winning
trump, We're winning all over
trump, We're winning in Washington that Democrats keep losing their minds
trump, That is why millions of registered Democrat voters are leaving their party to join our movement
trump, Look, we're a unified party
trump, The Republican party has never been unified like it is today
trump, I'll show you
trump, I could say, We're going to go over to the Hill
trump, No, we're going to go over to someplace and we're going to do a rally at eight o'clock tonight
trump, We'd have tens of thousands of people there
trump, There's never been this
trump, Ronald Reagan was great
trump, I thought he was a great guy, great president, didn't like his policy on trade
trump, That's okay
trump, Trade
trump, But if he came to Las Vegas, you know they'd have a ballroom, and they'd have 500, maybe a thousand people
trump, What we're doing… And this isn't even, I must say this, I don't want to tell you this, this is not election season
trump, Because we're nine months away
trump, Election season is when you're two months away
trump, We're not even in election season and we have more enthusiasm now
trump, Believe it or not, then we had even before the election in 2016
trump, It's true
trump, It's too early
trump, It's too early
trump, It's true
trump, We have a great gentleman and a woman with us, a friend of mine, mister and misses Sheldon Adelson, right over here
trump, Great, great person
trump, Two great people
trump, He's got so much money, he doesn't know what the hell to do with it
trump, He owns the Sands Hotel
trump, That's like one of the smaller businesses
trump, Sheldon, that's like your small business, right He is a great guy
trump, She's an incredible, she's a doctor, and she studies addiction, and drugs, drug addiction, all sorts of addictions
trump, And she knows more about that subject, I think, than anybody, and she works hard and she doesn't need it
trump, He does not need the money that she brings in
trump, Okay He also happens on the paper
trump, He owns the paper
trump, You own the paper in town, right They wanted like a couple of hundred million dollars too much
trump, You said, Give it to them
trump, It's peanuts
trump, What the hell difference does it make We want to thank the Adelsons
trump, They've been incredible fans and they love Israel
trump, They love Israel
trump, I just saw him sitting there
trump, I didn't know they were here
trump, I just see him sitting there
trump, He's something
trump, The chairman of the Nevada Republican party, who's really been great
trump, He's been with me for a long time and he's a very committed man
trump, Make America great again
trump, Oh, oh, oh
trump, Let's do a poll quick
trump, Just quick
trump, I'll never get rid of MAGA because I'm superstitious
trump, But we just hit an all time high with the stock market
trump, Our military is rebuilt
trump, You just got the greatest tax cuts in history, the greatest rate, regulation cuts, and all this stuff
trump, So, let me ask you this
trump, So, Make America great again, it sort of doesn't work quite as well
trump, So now we have keep America great and we have the new hat
trump, It's higher, stiff
trump, It's like a billboard, right I call it the billboard
trump, It's a billboard
trump, So let's go just that
trump, Because I am very surprised by it
trump, We're going to keep them both, but I just curious if we did go to one, Make America great again  Keep America great I can't
trump, I would have said that's impossible
trump, Make America great again, is the greatest phrase
trump, A lot of people, again, fake news, I think will agree to it
trump, It's the greatest phrase ever used in politics
trump, It's the greatest phrase
trump, Now, who has the greatest phrase ever used in the history of politics and say, Oh, let's go with a new phrase
trump, Right But we're going to keep it
trump, So we have to keep MAGA
trump, But now we have CAG, now we have CAG
trump, So we have a both
trump, I just don't have the courage to get rid of the one
trump, It would be too disrespectful
trump, Too disrespectful
trump, But Michael McDonald, I want to thank you and the members of the Nevada Republican central committee
trump, You're all here
trump, They're great people
trump, And the man came here
trump, He loves us
trump, He's been with us
trump, Rick Harrison of the world famous gold and silver pawn shop
trump, Rick Harrison
trump, You better win, Michael
trump, Otherwise, that's the last time I'm introducing you like that
trump, I hear we're up
trump, I hear we're doing nicely
trump, I hear we're doing great
trump, And by the way, the union, I have a lot of respect for that union
trump, Last time, I had a strike in my building during the election
trump, It's the only reason we would have won this state
trump, Brilliantly to save three cents
trump, I could have settled the strike before the election
trump, I wanted to save 2 total
trump, And he wasn't too good
trump, He didn't do too good
trump, But we almost won this state despite… I had a big strike
trump, Had thousands and thousands of union guys
trump, They had it, look, they wanted, wanted to show us
trump, But I think that the unions are really with us and the unions have been with us
trump, They're Teamsters, so many of the unions
trump, Because I'm for the working man and woman, whether you're union or non-union
trump, Some States are all union, some states are no union
trump, But we get them all
trump, And I think we're going to have tremendous success
trump, And a lot of the Democrats are going to ruin the healthcare programs that these unions have
trump, The unions have worked hard on healthcare and they're going to ruin them
trump, They're going to take away… Well, we're going to… you can lose 180 million people off of great private healthcare
trump, So we'll see what happens
trump, But a lot of the Democrats want to do that
trump, They think it's wonderful
trump, But together we're building the world's most prosperous economy and the most inclusive society
trump, That's true
trump, Since my election, over 125- That's true
trump, Since my election, over 125,000 new jobs have been created right here in Nevada, including over 40,000 new Nevada manufacturing and construction jobs
trump, A 30 increase
trump, The national unemployment rate is the lowest in over half a century, and soon we're going to have that be a historic number like so many of the others
trump, The average unemployment rate for my administration, this is the coolest of them all, is the lowest for any United States president in recorded history
trump, That's pretty good
trump, When I'm in a debate, they're saying, we're going to do this
trump, I say, listen, we have the best unemployment numbers in the history of our country
trump, African American unemployment, Hispanic American
trump, Hispanic, we got a lot of Hispanic
trump, I love Hispanic
trump, Who in this audience is Hispanic Yeah, we're doing great
trump, Well, we should be doing great
trump, You have the lowest unemployment rates ever recorded
trump, Asian Americans, likewise the lowest ever recorded
trump, The unemployment rate for women reached the lowest rate in 71 years
trump, African American youth unemployment has reached an all time historic low
trump, People I love, people I might've helped more than anybody because of choice and accountability
trump, The veteran's unemployment rate drop to the lowest record
trump, Lowest in history
trump, The unemployment rate for disabled Americans has reached an all time historic low and you got to remember they're back there checking every word
trump, They're going, oh, my god
trump, He's right
trump, I can't say it because I got all these maniacs back there
trump, They're trying to find… He put the comma in the wrong place
trump, He didn't make that word plural, therefore he lied
trump, Now I've got to be very accurate because all these numbers, they check them out
trump, They're in there, checking them out
trump, Check on the African American unemployment, please
trump, Please tell me it's not historic
trump, These people are among the most dishonest human beings on earth
trump, Not all of them
trump, Workers without a high school diploma
trump, We have millions of people that didn't go through high school
trump, They left
trump, They had problems, good problems, bad problems, families where they don't have the money
trump, They didn't get a high school diploma
trump, They've achieved the lowest unemployment rate ever recorded in the history of the United States
trump, Those are important groups of people
trump, Half a million more Hispanic Americans now own a home
trump, Now, Hispanic have done so good
trump, And by the way, you know who understands the border, because we are building that wall like crazy
trump, Remember, they also said, if you build the wall you'll lose the Hispanic vote
trump, I said, I got to do what's right
trump, You know who understands the border better than anybody You know who understands crime at the border better than anybody The Hispanics understand it and they don't want to be working and have people come and take their job
trump, Have people come in where they can't pay for their house, have people come in who are very bad people
trump, You have some very bad people
trump, You have murderers and rapists, and we have set all sorts of records at the border, but we're up to 122 miles of wall, and it is true
trump, The people that understand it the best are Hispanic
trump, So, thank you
trump, We got to make our country safe
trump, We've lifted 10 million people off of welfare
trump, Median household income is now the highest ever recorded in our country
trump, Think of that
trump, I say it all the time
trump, President Bush, eight years, 450
trump, President Barack Hussein Obama, eight years,  975
trump, President Donald John Trump, three years
trump, It's actually less when they did the numbers
trump, Three years, including the big tax cuts that we got you and the regulation cuts
trump, Three years
trump, So, you had 450, 975, that's eight and eight
trump, Now we're down to three years, a little less, three years,  10,000 per family a year
trump, 10,000 a year
trump, Our historic regulatory reduction campaign is restoring American liberty and ending the tyranny of federal bureaucrats
trump, I deal with them
trump, They're not good
trump, It's called the swamp
trump, We've ended the war on American energy, lowering utility bills, reducing prices at the pump, reducing your prices
trump, Part of that number is all of the money that we save at the pump and on electric
trump, I also recently took action on an issue Nevada has been dealing with for over 30 years
trump, Yucca mountain
trump, You know Yucca mountain My budget stops funding for the licensing of waste storage at Yucca mountain, so that we can focus on positive solutions and for much better reasons and alternatives
trump, Why should you have nuclear waste in your backyard I won't say which countries, but you know what other countries do I will not say which ones
trump, They put it on a ship
trump, They float it out into the middle of the ocean
trump, They find a nice deep spot and they dump it
trump, That's the end of it
trump, But we would never do that for environmental reasons
trump, We are reversing decades so Yucca mountain… You're okay, please
trump, Okay
trump, Just relax
trump, Sheldon, do you have somebody at your newspaper back there who can write
trump, Yucca mountain, please
trump, He'll call up, Yucca mountain is okay
trump, That's the end of that
trump, So Yucca mountain, you're in great shape
trump, Maybe they can finally report it properly, but we're reversing decades of calamitous trade policies
trump, For years, Washington politicians took money from lobbyists, global corporations and corrupt special interest to ship our jobs and factories and all of this stuff and all of this wealth
trump, They stole our wealth
trump, They shipped it overseas and to other countries
trump, America lost one in four manufacturing jobs following the twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance into the WTO, the world trade organization
trump, Probably an even worse deal for us than NAFTA, if that's possible, but under my administration, the great betrayal of America is over
trump, America is no longer for sale
trump, Last month we ended the NAFTA catastrophe and I signed the brand new U
trump,S
trump,, Mexico, Canada agreement USMCA
trump, See, we played the song YMCA because that's the only way you'll remember
trump, Just think of the song YMCA
trump, Think of the song and you'll remember that USMCA is a gigantic victory for farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers all across the great state of Nevada
trump, I also took the strongest ever action to confront China's massive theft of America jobs
trump, Our strategy worked
trump, Last month, we signed a ground breaking trade agreement
trump, Probably the biggest agreement of any kind ever signed with China that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property and boost American exports by a lot
trump, China will be buying 250 billion worth of goods from us now and 50 billion from our farmers
trump, My guys wanted 16, I said, make it 50
trump, My guys wanted 16, they got China up to 20
trump, I said, Nope
trump, Got to make it 50, and then I said to China, you got a billion and a half people
trump, What difference does it make They said, you're right
trump, 50 billion, I don't think our farmers can produce that much, but we're going to soon find out
trump, They're going to buy very large tractors
trump, After years of building up other countries, we are finally rebuilding our country
trump, we are finally putting America first
trump, Or no issue of Washington Democrats more thoroughly sold out the American people than the issue of immigration
trump, Before I came into office, the far left's policy of open borders allowed deadly drugs to flow freely into our country, poisoning our children, including right here in a very big way
trump, The great state of Nevada
trump, Washington Democrats put the needs of illegal immigrants before the wellbeing of American citizens
trump, You know that, you've been complaining about it for a long time
trump, It's one of the reasons you voted for Trump
trump, They want to let anyone from around the world simply walk across the border and then they want to give them a lifetime of free welfare, of healthcare, of lots of other things, including education
trump, All paid for by the taxpayers of the United States
trump, Illegal immigration costs Nevada taxpayers, think of it, more than 1
trump,6 billion every year, over 1,500 per household
trump, For the amount of money Washington Democrats want to spend supporting illegal immigrants, we could rebuild every city, all of these distressed areas in the United States, throughout our country
trump, The money spend, it's not even thinkable and don't forget when we say come, like in California the clown, he says, come, we'll give you free healthcare
trump, People that weren't even thinking about coming
trump, That's why we have caravans of people that we're turning back
trump, Mexico's been great
trump, By the way, they gave us 27,000 soldiers on our border
trump, But when a governor, nice guy actually, he's a nice guy
trump, We just got to explain the facts of life
trump, He's a nice guy
trump, Oh doctor, please
trump, Doctor in the house, please
trump, Medical, please
trump, A doctor
trump, Thank you
trump, Take your time
trump, We've got plenty of time
trump, Yeah, take your time please
trump, A lot of these people have been here for three days
trump, It's a lot
trump, Those front row people are tough
trump, Take your time, doc
trump, Thank you, everybody
trump, Thank you, doctor
trump, That's true
trump, They get here so… They stand and sit and sometimes days early
trump, In Colorado, they're there three, four days early
trump, It's tough
trump, And we work it and make sure that you have everything you want
trump, Number one, we cover the facts and number two, we want to have a good time because we have to have a good time
trump, But things like that happen a lot because after two, three days, it's not easy and these are strong people
trump, I'm not going to fight any of them, okay Now, amazing people
trump, Thank you very much
trump, Under my administration, we're finally taking care of our own citizens first, including millions of illegal immigrants who follow our laws, pay their taxes, lift up our society, and are entitled to a government that protects their families and protects their communities
trump, Every day, Democrats' open border policies are harming and killing innocent people
trump, You know what's happening, you know what's going on
trump, In this region alone last year, ICE officers, and they're patriots
trump, They're strong, tough patriots
trump, If we didn't have them
trump, They remove thousands and thousands of MS13 gang members a year and plenty of others
trump, Who else is going to do it ICE officers arrested over 5, 000 criminal aliens charged or convicted of dangerous offenses, including robbery, rape, and even murder
trump, Many murders
trump, In Western Nevada, an illegal alien was charged with robbing and brutally executing four victims last year
trump, Right here in Las Vegas, three MS13 gang members abducted a man, tied him up with his shoelaces, shot him repeatedly, and hacked him to death with a machete
trump, You know exactly what I'm talking about
trump, It's right here in your place, in Las Vegas, right here
trump, Tied up and hacked him to death
trump, Yet left wing politicians oppose all detention of illegal aliens, even convicted criminals and murderers, and they support deadly sanctuary cities
trump, I say this all the time and I just… How the hell, where are they coming from I don't get it right
trump, Seriously, I don't get it
trump, Sanctuary cities imperil American lives by releasing dangerous criminal aliens directly into your communities
trump, If you want to shut down sanctuary cities, if you want to protect your family and your loved ones, you must vote Republican in 2020
trump, And you have some great ones here, Michael
trump, Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, we have reduced illegal border crossings eight straight months in a row
trump, And as the wall gets longer, it gets easier and easier
trump, Remember when the Democrats were saying, you don't need a wall
trump, Two things that never change, right All these computers, they said, use drones
trump, Oh great, we'll fly over with drones
trump, Watch the people pour in by the thousands
trump, That's great
trump, Use drones
trump, Before I came along, they all wanted a wall
trump, They just didn't know how to build it
trump, They had no clue
trump, They had the money, they actually gave the money back, but they had no clue
trump, But as soon as I came in and I said, Wall, they went against and I made a terrible mistake
trump, We catch them
trump, You know the story
trump, They come over, could be a killer, murderer, rapist
trump, They come over
trump, We can't do anything
trump, We have to be politically correct
trump, We catch them
trump, We then say, what's your address They don't know
trump, They don't even know their country in many cases
trump, Where do you come from We don't know and they mean it, but some are very serious criminals
trump, So, we catch them, we take whatever they can take, which is nothing, and then we had to release them in our country
trump, We can't bring them back
trump, And then we have a system of judges, thousands of judges all over the place
trump, You got to be like Perry Mason and every illegal that comes in, they have the lawyers
trump, The lawyers meet them, they get paid fees, but we're breaking the system
trump, No more catch and release, you think that was easy And the big thing is that 30 foot… And this wall is built exactly to the specifications of border patrol
trump, Totally
trump, And border patrol has seized the largest amount, just recently, of deadly narcotics ever recorded
trump, The largest amount
trump, We've deported record numbers of gang members
trump, We've done more to secure the border than any administration in history
trump, We are, as I said, building the wall faster than ever
trump, Faster and bigger than anyone thought possible
trump, They can't believe we're getting it done
trump, We'll have over 500 miles of wall built sometime next year
trump, 500 miles
trump, Washington Democrats have never been more extreme than they are right now
trump, 132 congressional Democrats have now signed up for Bernie Sanders takeover of healthcare that would strip 180 million Americans, many of them in this room, of their private coverage
trump, Remember president Obama Remember, he said, you can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan
trump, 28 times, he lied, so we should impeach him
trump, We're going to impeach him
trump, We'll do a belated impeachment
trump, 28 times, you can keep your doctor, right Remember, you could keep your doctor
trump, Unfortunately, when they found out you can't keep your doctor, he said, I was just kidding
trump, Now, we should impeach him
trump, We'll do a belated impeachment
trump, Fake news, you have it
trump, See, you have to be very careful when you say impeachment because you know what they do They go back and they write
trump, President Trump said that Obama should be impeached, but he's not in office and so therefore they can't impeach
trump, He doesn't know what he's talking about because he's not in office, so therefore they can't
trump, So, you have to be very careful
trump, That's why I use the word belated impeachment
trump, Belated, meaning I'm just kidding, okay They do it all the time
trump, They had it the other day
trump, I said, bring back Gone With The Wind, right I said a little bit up here, but I said the movie the other day in Colorado, I guess
trump, I said, Huh, South Korean movie won
trump, They said, ladies and gentlemen, the winner of the Academy Award is … A movie made in South Korea, what's this all about And I deal with them, they like me
trump, We're helping them a lot
trump, They're killing us on trade
trump, They beat us on trade and then they win the Academy Award for a fricking movie
trump, But we redid that trade deal, but the other day they got me on this one too
trump, I said, whatever happened to Gone With the Wind, that beautiful movie Vivian Lee, Clark Gable, right Whatever happened, bring back Gone With the Wind
trump, And some of them wrote, he doesn't know that that movie was made in 1936
trump, He says fake news
trump, It is fake news, they're fakers
trump, But now, anybody sitting there reading this saying, man, Trump, can't be that smart
trump, He said bring back Gone With the Wind
trump, That's an old movie
trump, Yeah, it's an old classic
trump, What I say is make great movies, not this computerized garbage
trump, And I was never a fan of Brad Pitt, I will tell you that
trump, No, I thought he was a stiff
trump, He was a stiff, it's like a boring guy
trump, All of a sudden he wins the Academy Award, so fitting
trump, Their ratings aren't so good at the Academy Awards
trump, You know when that stopped When they started attacking us, their ratings went right down the tubers
trump, I told somebody, the evening newscasts, they're terrible for conservative people and they're crooked, they're absolutely dishonest
trump, I said to one of the big broadcasters, I'm friendly with him
trump, I said, if you ever did a conservative newscasts, instead of… you got, ABC is terrible
trump, NBC is just absolutely atrocious
trump, And they do badly
trump, Not a lot of people are watching
trump, They used to, when we had the late, great Walter Cronkite and these legends, right But ABC is terrible and NBC is terrible and CBS is terrible
trump, They're all the same
trump, And I said, your ratings stink
trump, If you would do a newscast that's conservative, I'd get them a host
trump, I could recommend guys right now, right I'd get them a host
trump, We'll call up… Don't take Sean Hannity away from us
trump, Don't take our show
trump, That's my problem, I don't want to take away any of our people
trump, You get a Pete Hegseth
trump, You get a Jesse Waters
trump, You get… I could name so many of them, right And you put them on that broadcast, their ratings would go up five fold but they don't know that
trump, I don't know
trump, They're stupid
trump, Their ratings would go through the roof, but they would rather have a failed broadcast that nobody watches than put on a conservative person and lift the ratings five times
trump, They would rather have a fail… Seven months ago we had a little skit, and they were hoping the market would crash because they would rather lose their money, or big parts of it, and have a really horrible market on the basis that we, not me, we could not be elected on November 3rd
trump, This is how crazy- … on November 3rd
trump, This is how evil, this is how crazy they are
trump, They've gone crazy
trump, I guess you call it Trump derangement syndrome
trump, But if they ever did a conservative broadcast, meaning very fair, very honest When I say that, it's almost like do a fair broadcast
trump, Just a fair broadcast
trump, That thing would be the hottest show
trump, But they don't realize it
trump, And if they do, they probably wouldn't do it anyway because they don't want to go away from what they're doing, which is crazy because it is, they're doing very poorly
trump, While the social and socialist Democrats are trying to destroy American healthcare and your Social Security, they're putting it at risk, my administration is protecting your Social Security
trump, Remember they said, four years ago in the debates and you had this crazy woman
trump, I mean, I hate to mention her name
trump, I did it you know, yesterday
trump, I threw all the runs, hates it
trump, She's a zero
trump, It's got zero television personality
trump, Aero AB Stoddard, whoever that is
trump, She said, Donald Trump lost all of his debates
trump, I won every debate and maybe, I don't know maybe one somebody, but I won with tremendous numbers
trump, He says, You always won
trump, I'm not sure
trump, We try, I'll tell you that and we're winning now
trump, But this crazy woman who's got zero going, zero
trump, She said, Donald Trump lost his debates that he won
trump, You know, she was talking about how badly Benny Mike did
trump, So she said, Well, Donald Trump
trump, No, I won every single debate
trump, I won them against crooked Hillary
trump, I won them in the primaries like 15 or 16 debates
trump, And for some reason, you know, sometimes you do say, it's not a big deal
trump, Nobody watches it
trump, Nobody cares
trump, Nobody even knows who she is
trump, I just made her famous, right She's nothing
trump, She's nothing
trump, She's got no talent, got nothing
trump, She's probably got a little drive
trump, That's how she keeps getting on television
trump, Other people don't have her drive
trump, But you know what I said, That's really unfair
trump, So I took out the polls, Time magazine, Drudge, good guy, Drudge, Drudge
trump, We took out a lot of different things and we put up the Drudge poll, the Time magazine and many others
trump, And some of them had to be down to like at 91 and they didn't have many people and I can't really show up because many of those people are now great friends of mine
trump, Some of them are great Republican senators
trump, I'm not going to show results, but I'm holding it up just quickly glancing
trump, I call it a glancing blow, but we won the debates and I have this fake news person saying, Donald Trump did very poorly in the debates
trump, I want every debate easily
trump, I never did it before
trump, Remember my first question I said, Rosie O'Donnell
trump, That was one of my best answers
trump, Rosie O'Donnell who violated the campaign finance laws as badly as anybody I've ever seen and nothing happens to her
trump, Right And yet ‘jevich violate … He made a little mistake and they want to destroy him
trump, So we pardoned him
trump, We pardoned him
trump, By the way, he made a mistake
trump, Rosie O'Donnell
trump, That was a massive violation of the campaign finance laws but Dinesh, Dinesh, they wanted to put him in jail
trump, I don't know
trump, I think he might've even gone to jail for a period of time for doing something that was really very understandable
trump, Rosie O'Donnell
trump, Five times what she did is incredible
trump, Nothing happens
trump, And then she gets on and says, what a bad guy I am
trump, I'm not a bad guy, but it's really a disgrace
trump, You know, it's a disgrace
trump, I'm glad they didn't do anything with it, frankly because you know what to do for something like that
trump, But you know what We have two sets of justices in this country
trump, It's no good
trump, It's no good
trump, It's no good
trump, You know the thing we're working on right now We're trying to get fairness for a certain person who's been treated very unfairly
trump, A man who had a juror, who was a radical anti-Trump person, and she didn't say that when she went up there and she became the foreperson of the jury and she did terrible things and said terrible things
trump, And you know how they caught her
trump, When he was convicted and then a statement was made, she started jumping up and down screaming,  Yes, yes
trump, And started telling everybody
trump, They said, Wait a minute
trump, Wasn't she just a juror The woman was totally biased
trump, How do you do this So I fight
trump, Look, I fight
trump, A lot of times it's not worth it, but I got to fight for fairness
trump, I got to fight for fairness
trump, Got to fight for fairness
trump, It's a very unfair system
trump, I guess it's called the swamp
trump, When I said drain the swamp, it was a nice phrase
trump, I never liked the phrase
trump, When I was campaigning, somehow the phrase came up, Sir, I think we have a phrase, drain the swamp
trump, I said, I don't like it
trump, That's too hokey
trump, But one day I was in a big arena, 25,000 people packed before the election and I said, And we will drain the swamp
trump, The place went crazy
trump, I said, Wow, you never know
trump, You never know
trump, Frank Sinatra said his best song
trump, I won't tell you which one because I'll ruin it for you, but his best song is the song that he thought would never make it, the song that he liked the least, but he said that's the one that was the most successful that the people like you never know
trump, So I said, Drain the swamp
trump, And the people went crazy
trump, I said, Woah
trump, I said, Let's try that again
trump, And the next time I did it again and again and again
trump, I only didn't know how disgusting and dirty the swamp is and a lot of the media is a big part of the swamp
trump, So my administration is protecting your social security, your Medicare, and is fighting to give you great healthcare
trump, We're defending your right to keep your doctor and your plan
trump, We're defending that right
trump, You're going to have that right back
trump, We're going to cancel that Obamacare if we could win the case and we're going to give you great healthcare and we're making healthcare better and much cheaper while premiums more than doubled in the last five years before I took office
trump, We're managing it very well
trump, We got rid of the individual mandate, by far the most unpopular thing where you had to pay a lot of money for the privilege of not having to pay for bad healthcare, right We got rid of it
trump, And it was upheld in the Supreme Court, what we did
trump, Whenever we get sued, everything we do, if we move, if we take 10 steps right or left, we get sued and we're now offering plans that are up to 60 less expensive
trump, We're going to make healthcare a big part of this campaign
trump, We're protecting people with preexisting conditions and we always will
trump, That's why if we are successful, you don't want the Supreme Court to try and get rid of this, the caucus
trump, It's a caucus known as Obamacare, but we're running it much better than they did
trump, Remember when they had, this was the greatest, the 5 billion website, right 5 billion
trump, It was supposed to cost 5 million
trump, I have a son at home
trump, He's 13
trump, He's a genius with computers
trump, Hi, dad
trump, What's up Dead dad
trump, Get out of here
trump, Hey listen
trump, I'm the president of the United States, pal
trump, Don't talk to your dad
trump, Dad, Come on dad
trump, Can't you see I'm playing with my computer The guy talks to me and he's working with his computer
trump, These guys are genius
trump, You know, they grow up with like walking, right But he's looking at me
trump, I could have given him their healthcare site
trump, He would have done it for nothing and it would have been better than what they have
trump, So remember, come on, dad
trump, I'm busy, dad
trump, What do you want What do you want, dad Barron, woah
trump, Wow, he's going to like that
trump, He's a good boy
trump, He's a tall boy
trump, I'll tell you that
trump, Just turned 13
trump, He's up there
trump, I'm saying, Hi Barron
trump, How are you doing But they're great with the computers
trump, They spent 5 billion
trump, Okay
trump, It was going to cost 50
trump, It was going to cost five
trump, It was going to cost 50
trump, Then it was going to 
trump,
trump, What was the final number Five hundreds
trump, The number that they spent, 5 billion
trump, Right It still doesn't work
trump, They spent 5 billion
trump, Right And they spent 500 million on all of the problems it caused and we've really straightened it out, but it's still lousy healthcare, Obamacare
trump, And it's really not Obamacare anymore because when you get rid of the individual mandate, it's no longer Obamacare but we're going to terminate it
trump, We're going to give you your preexisting a hundred per- otherwise I won't do it
trump, We're going to give you brand new preexisting and we're going to have a great healthcare that's much less expensive
trump, And we're fighting to stop surprise medical bill and Barron's is going to be very happy
trump, I signed an executive order imposing price transparency because when providers are required to show their prices, those same prices fall very fast
trump, You know, a man that does this very professionally is great, into the healthcare business and you have to be careful when you say it, but you know it was just a very strong statement
trump, But he said, Sir, price transparency in hospitals
trump, Where you can bid it out and you can look at the prices
trump, Right now you can't see
trump, If you go to a hospital, they won't even tell you how much it's going to cost
trump, They operate and then they'll give you a bill and you'll say, Oh my god, I had no idea it could be
trump, They take blood
trump, We have one person, blood 39
trump, Another place, the exact same thing, 2500
trump, Take blood, a blood test
trump, One is 39 one, is 2500
trump, The same test
trump, Maybe the 39 test is better
trump, Who the hell knows But it's crazy
trump, Price transparency and he looks at me
trump, He goes, and he's a real pro
trump, One of the top in the country
trump, He said, Sir, and nobody wanted to do it because it's a little bit controversial and a lot of the drug companies don't exactly love it
trump, The hospitals don't love it, but I got to do what's right for you
trump, The people, I don't care, I'm not
trump, I got to do it
trump, But he looked at me
trump, And this is why I did it
trump, It was one phrase
trump, You know, do you ever do where you're not going to do something And then somebody hits you with a perfect phrase
trump, He said, Sir, price transparency is bigger than healthcare
trump, I said, What do you mean by that He said, You will see numbers that far outweigh healthcare, hospitals, doctors
trump, He said, You'll be able to price out everything
trump, You'll be able to see costs
trump, He said, Price transparency
trump, You know, people you've heard about this for 15, 20 years
trump, No president has the guts to do it
trump, Probably means I won't get campaign contributions from certain people, but I'm not going to get them anyway
trump, What the hell difference does that make I don't want them
trump, I don't want them
trump, I got to do what's right
trump, You know, we're here for a short period of time
trump, Even if it's a long period, it's still a short period and we've got to do so
trump, Price transparency is a big deal
trump, He said it's bigger than healthcare
trump, Think of that
trump, Bigger than healthcare
trump, So let's see what happens
trump, But that'll kick in
trump, Unfortunately, that kicks in after the election because we're going through the final stages
trump, We going through a statutory process, unfortunately
trump, So think of it, we're going to win
trump, But let's say the fake news could give me enough phony stories, enough bad stuff that we don't make it
trump, The new president will get all the credit for price transparency and he won't even know what the hell it is
trump, And I took the heat
trump, Isn't that something But we're going to win
trump, We got to win for that reason alone
trump, We've approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs, which are just as good as the name brand drugs, but a fraction of the cost
trump, And that was another one
trump, Tremendous political pressure
trump, Think of it
trump, You own Bayer aspirin
trump, You own all these name name brand drugs that are making so much money
trump, And then the guy comes along said, I want to make 20 forms of aspirin
trump, They're exactly the same
trump, Exactly
trump, But they don't have a big name on it
trump, Exactly as good
trump, I don't say better
trump, I don't say worse
trump, They're exactly the same
trump, You know, people still, they want to go out and buy the name
trump, You know I do
trump, I do
trump, You know Because it's just because we're stupid
trump, No, it's true
trump, They're exactly the same
trump, We're approving so many of the generic drugs, a record number
trump, Nobody's ever approved so much
trump, The drug companies hate it
trump, They hate it
trump, Never happened like what we're doing
trump, We also took down the trial periods from 12 years down to five or six years
trump, They'd have a new drug
trump, The thing was obsolete by the time it got approved
trump, We've passed a really spectacular thing that they've been trying to get for 40 some odd years
trump, Right to try
trump, So you don't have to now go if you get, hopefully nobody in this room has those kind of problems
trump, Right to try
trump, And so now you go and you sign a waiver and you get everything
trump, It's great
trump, If you're terminally ill
trump, If you're very, very sick, you're not going to make it
trump, And you know why they didn't do it They wouldn't approve it because they didn't want to be sued
trump, And they said, No, this could be dangerous
trump, They said, The people are terminally ill, they're going to die
trump, Let them use the experimental drugs
trump, Don't wait because they have another four or five years before they can come onto the market
trump, And it turned out we are having such unbelievable results
trump, And you know what else Some of those drug companies are now like it
trump, That they fought me like crazy because it's really showing if it works there, it's really showing that it works
trump, It's pretty amazing
trump, Right to try and this is really something, brand new initiatives combating kidney disease and combating Alzheimer's disease
trump, We've made a lot of progress
trump, We've made a lot of progress, Sheldon and we're pursuing new advances in the neonatal research to care for America's youngest patients, our babies, and breaking all records in so doing
trump, All of the radical Democrats in the presidential debates have declared their unlimited support for extreme late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up until the very moment of birth
trump, This is why in my state of the union address, did you like it Good
trump, It's a different kind of address
trump, You know, we can go lots of different ways, right Presidential, not presidential
trump, I was presidential
trump, Totally
trump, You'd have about three people standing here, but I asked Congress to prohibit late term abortion of babies because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God
trump, The Democrat party is the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, blatant corruption, and the total obliteration of your very, very important second amendment
trump, The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and the late great Abraham Lincoln, which everybody forgot
trump, Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background, every community, and every single walk of life
trump, We are the party of boundless optimism, excitement, energy, and enthusiasm
trump, We are wealthy, right Are we enthusiastic You know how many of these I've done in the last four days People say, Where the hell do you get your energy I say, Well, the truth is I like what I do and if we weren't getting the results, I wouldn't like it
trump, If we weren't getting the results
trump, If I didn't see the results, I wouldn't like it at all
trump, We're welcoming Americans of all parties and political persuasions to join our incredible movement to make America great again
trump, We're a very big party
trump, We are the party of big ideas for the future
trump, Republicans are fighting for school choice because no parent should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school
trump, I passed criminal justice reform to give former prisoners a second chance at life
trump, Was never going to happen
trump, We got it done
trump, This could not have been done by anyone but the Republican party and ourselves
trump, You know the Democrats have tried for years
trump, They couldn't get it done
trump, We got it done
trump, To uphold the rule of law
trump, We are confirmed and this is something they say
trump, Most important thing you can do, judges
trump, I say most important thing is defense
trump, Second is judges
trump, A record number of 217 federal judges who will interpret the constitution as written
trump, And we have appointed two great new Supreme court justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh
trump, I recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem and we recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights
trump, We have invested 2
trump,2 trillion to rebuild the United States military, including more than 130 million for Nellis air force base right here
trump, And we just created the sixth branch of the American armed forces, the Space Force, 72 years, 72 years
trump, The air force was 72 years ago
trump, We just did a branch
trump, It's a big deal, isn't it Think of it
trump, A branch, the army, the air force
trump, Think of it
trump, We did a branch
trump, For years you watched as your politicians apologized for America
trump, Now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the people of Nevada
trump, At stake in our present battle is the survival of our nation
trump, If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for to secure, then we must devote everything we have toward victory in November of 2020 November 3rd
trump, November 3rd
trump, Only this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp once and for all
trump, With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity
trump, Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane and lawful system of immigration
trump, We will continue to enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that very beautiful phrase, Made in the USA
trump, We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic within nine years in America
trump, And we will land the first woman on the moon and become the first nation in the world to plant its flag on Mars
trump, We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms
trump, And that is under siege in case you haven't noticed
trump, You know, your second amendment is under siege
trump, Just don't worry
trump, Long as I'm here, they're not touching it
trump, Above all, we will never stop fighting for this
trump, So true
trump, But we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America, we support, protect and defend the constitution of the United States
trump, We stand with the incredible heroes and they are heroes
trump, We love them, of law enforcement
trump, We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life
trump, We believe that faith and family, not government bureaucracy are the true American way
trump, We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag
trump, And we live by the words of our national motto, in God we trust
trump, From Carson city to Reno to right here in Las Vegas, we stand on the shoulders of red blooded American patriots who poured out their heart, sweat, and soul to secure our liberty and to defend our great, beautiful, lovely freedom, freedom, freedom
trump, Freedom
trump, Nevada was founded by pioneers and prospectors, miners and cowboys who tamed the frontier, raised the mighty Hoover dam
trump, That's a beauty
trump, Transformed the barren desert into a shining oasis, lit up the lights of the Las Vegas strip and help to make this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth
trump, And we are making it greater than ever before
trump, Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country
trump, We are returning power to you, the American people
trump, With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working
trump, We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning
trump, We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God
trump, America is thriving like never before
trump, And ladies and gentlemen of Nevada, the best is yet to come together
trump, We will make America wealthy again
trump, We will make America strong again
trump, We will make America proud again
trump, We will make America safe again and we will make America great again
trump, Thank you very much, everybody
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you, Nevada
trump, Thank you, Las Vegas
trump, We love Las Vegas
trump, Thank you everybody
trump, Thank you
trump,
trump,So thank you Pennsylvania, very much
trump, I'm thrilled to be in Latrobe, the home of the late, great, my friend, Arnold Palmer
trump, What a great guy he was
trump, What a great guy
trump, Thank you very much
trump, 61 days from now, we're going to win the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and we are going to win four more years in the White House
trump, Joe Biden wants to surrender your jobs to China
trump, You know that
trump, His son walked out with a lot of money for doing nothing
trump, He wants to surrender your nation to the radical left wing mob
trump, He's trying to change now
trump, We say that's not working because we're going up and he's dropping like a rock in water
trump, And before the China virus, this election was over
trump, Now I had to go back to work and we've done a great job on it
trump, We don't get the credit
trump, We don't get the credit
trump, We made a lot of governors look very good
trump, But I will keep your jobs in America, and I'll bring rioters, looters, violent extremists, anarchists, we will bring them to justice
trump, That's what we're doing right now
trump, We have over 400 right now under arrest
trump, These are bad people
trump, Over the last three and a half years, we've secured America's borders, fixed our broken trade deals, rebuilt the United States military, obliterated the ISIS caliphate 100, secured American energy independence, and built the single greatest economy in the history of the world, and now we're going to do it again
trump, Have to do it again
trump, Have to do it again
trump, Got to do it again
trump, And it's happening
trump, You see what's happening
trump, Job numbers, retail sale numbers, they're all at records
trump, It's happening
trump, It's happening very fast
trump, It's actually happening in a super V, not a V
trump, It's a super V and you'll see that, and big numbers are coming out and have come out, and just watch your set or watch your newspaper
trump, Read your newspaper
trump, You're seeing numbers that, congressmen, we haven't seen those numbers ever before, actually
trump, We've never seen them
trump, And by the way, we have record stock markets
trump, We have record everything
trump, You're going to have an incredible economic year next year
trump, Your stocks are going up
trump, Your 401s are through the roof
trump, I had a little pause today
trump, People wanted to take some profits and probably somebody said something stupid along the way
trump, But the stock market's at record levels
trump, Think of it
trump, In the hopefully rounding the turn on the pandemic, we're rounding that turn, and vaccines are coming along great
trump, The job that they've done, the doctors, everybody else, we're years ahead of schedule
trump, Anybody else's President, you wouldn't be talking about vaccines for two or three years from now
trump, I'll tell you right now
trump, That I can tell you
trump, Biden will never be able to protect your jobs or your family
trump, He is a puppet of the socialists, Marxists, and the cop hating extremists
trump, And they are cop hating
trump, And we love our law enforcement
trump, We love our law enforcement
trump, And by the way, I don't know if you saw this, if there's any way of you seeing it, we have thousands of people behind this hangar, thousands, and we're trying to get them in
trump, And I'd love to get them in
trump, I mean, it's an airport
trump, Let them go to the runways
trump, Okay Let them in
trump, I mean, literally there, we landed
trump, I actually thought that was the crowd
trump, We're doing the hanger thing now because the arenas can't do it because of the pandemic for a while, a little while
trump, But in certain ways, I like this better
trump, I don't have to travel
trump, I get off the plane
trump, I make a speech
trump, I get the hell out of here
trump, No, these are great
trump, Do you remember the last days before the campaign I'd do a lot of them a day
trump, Get off that plane
trump, It was a little different plane
trump, It was black and white instead of the blue and white
trump, But we had some time
trump, And that was an important day and that was an important year, 2016
trump, But I will tell you, the election that we have coming up is the single most important election in the history of this country
trump, And we had a level of enthusiasm, I mean, even look today
trump, With all going on, look at the kind of crowds we have
trump, But we had record enthusiasm in 2016
trump, By the way, was that greatest evening ever November
trump, And now it's going to be November 3rd, and we'll keep it going and we'll get it all like a tree
trump, You move that tree
trump, It takes a little while to plant, your tax cuts
trump, They're going to raise your taxes
trump, They're going to take away your guns
trump, Really, if you look
trump, And you know, they'll criticize me for saying this, the fake news media, which is back there, with their fake polls
trump, The same as last year
trump, We could just put it all on tape
trump, The fake polls, the fake everything
trump, You know, they're called suppression polls
trump, They're meant to make you depressed
trump, Are you depressed You don't look depressed
trump, We have the real numbers
trump, We're leading everywhere
trump, We are leading everywhere
trump, I'll tell you
trump, I think we're way ahead of what we were four years ago, and there's far more enthusiasm
trump, Our base is bigger
trump, It's stronger
trump, And we've done the greatest job
trump, Again, if we didn't get hit by the plague from China, between us, I would have canceled, Mr
trump, Congressman, most of the rallies
trump, I wouldn't have needed a rally
trump, That's a little bit unfair, but that's okay
trump, That's what China's done to our nation
trump, They've screwed us for a long time on a lot of different ways
trump, Never has anybody ripped off our nation like China, and I've taken in billions and billions of dollars
trump, We never took in 25 cents from China
trump, And I gave 28 billion, right, 28 billion to the farmers because they were targeted unfairly by China
trump, And our farmers are very unhappy
trump, I don't think we have too many farmers in this wonderful Pennsylvania town
trump, I know we have a lot of boilermakers over there
trump, We got a lot of boilermakers, I'll be talking about them
trump, Look at those guys
trump, Nobody going to mess with them
trump, I'll tell you
trump, We're going to be talking about them in a minute
trump, But for the entire summer, Biden was silent as far left rioters viciously attacked law enforcement in Democrat run cities all, burned down businesses, terrorized civilians, and just recently marched through the streets chanting, Death to America
trump, This is what we have
trump, Death to America
trump, And by the way, we could end it like immediately
trump, You saw what we did in Wisconsin
trump, It ended
trump, It took a while for the governor
trump, You know, they have to ask us in
trump, It's like, otherwise we have to do something much bigger and it's totally unnecessary
trump, The National Guard is fantastic
trump, I went to see them two days ago
trump, Biden went there today
trump, There was nobody there
trump, There was nobody there
trump, He was a little late
trump, I was going to say, Hey, listen, we ended that problem
trump, But we could end it in Portland
trump, Wise guys in Portland
trump, Anarchists
trump, They're agitators
trump, They're looters
trump, I'll tell you we could end it in Portland in a half an hour
trump, We did it in Seattle
trump, We told them we're coming in
trump, You either end it or were coming in
trump, Congressman, we were going in the next day
trump, We were all set
trump, I was actually disappointed, to be honest
trump, They ended it in Seattle
trump, They took over 20 of the city
trump, Do you believe this And the mayor said, No, it's going to be a summer of love
trump, These people are crazy
trump, So we end them very quickly
trump, We end them very quickly
trump, And now what we're doing is we're holding back funds for cities that don't know what they're doing, where they allow crime to run rampant
trump, And we put a 10 year prison sentence at anybody that knocks down a statue
trump, I took out an old ordinance, a very old one, because today in Congress, you don't get things like that today
trump, They think that you should just have no cash bail
trump, They do the no cash bail
trump, You kill somebody
trump, There's no bail
trump, Don't worry about it
trump, Go out
trump, But I took out an old ordinance
trump, I gave a new executive order
trump, It says 10 years in prison
trump, And amazingly, amazingly, that was three and a half months ago
trump, And they were having a big march on Washington, march elsewhere, and amazingly, that was the end of the statues coming down
trump, No statutes
trump, And we're actually prosecuting people for having done it
trump, We made it retroactive to the beginning
trump, Terrible
trump, Terrible
trump, And by the way, the state statues and monuments, they have to do the same thing
trump, It's real easy
trump, But the rioters that want Biden to win, they want him to win because their agenda, it's what they want
trump, It's the craziest thing I've ever seen
trump, They both want to cut funding for police
trump, They want to end that cash bail
trump, They want to hire far left prosecutors and judges, and let the criminals run wild
trump, The radical left District Attorney in Portland, Mike Schmidt, his name is, has released hundreds of rioters that announced that anyone arrested for interfering with police officers, disorderly conduct, criminal trespass, rioting, and other offenses will not be prosecuted under any circumstance
trump, Oh, it's worse
trump, It's worse
trump, You have somebody in Philadelphia who's worse, right Worse
trump, In his manifesto with Bernie Sanders, that's what it is, Biden agreed to all these things
trump, You notice now, No, no
trump, I never said about fracking
trump, I never said
trump, If you don't do fracking in Pennsylvania, 900,000 jobs and your energy bills will triple
trump, Other than that, I don't think you should have it
trump, Okay No, but he said in the manifesto, plus he said many times, we put on the clip yesterday where he, no fracking, no this, no that, I mean, no guns
trump, How about guns No guns
trump, No second amendment
trump, Biden has pledged to a point prosecutors who extend these insane far left policies nationwide
trump, That's what he's done
trump, That's called the manifesto
trump, He agreed to all this stuff
trump, The craziest thing, you're supposed to bring it to the right
trump, He actually brought it further left
trump, Bernie never dreamt that this was possible, crazy Bernie
trump, Do you know crazy Bernie I had a lot of his voters come to me four years ago, a big percentage
trump, You know why Because I agree with him and he agrees with me on one thing, trade
trump, The trade
trump, Because he knew that other countries are ripping us off and so did I
trump, Nobody else got it
trump, Especially Biden never got it
trump, He never got it
trump, Still doesn't get it
trump, Now he really gets nothing
trump, I tell you
trump, He didn't get it in prime time
trump, Now he really doesn't get it
trump, But it's okay for them to make every city look just like Portland which is a disaster
trump, And again, we could clean it up
trump, We just go right through it
trump, 5,000, 10,000, right through it
trump, These guys are tough
trump, They're smart
trump, And they love our country
trump, They love our country
trump, We'll clean it up in one half hour
trump, It'll be over
trump,  strength
trump, They don't understand
trump, Nice
trump, They chased him out of his home
trump, Unbelievable
trump, Biden's plan is to appease the domestic terrorist
trump, And my plan is to arrest them and prosecute them
trump, And I will always defend law abiding citizens
trump, That's why the rioters are voting for Biden and the law enforcement people, you know, we have it from everybody
trump, We just got the sheriffs in Florida, all of them, all of them
trump, We got Ohio
trump, We got Texas
trump, We got North Carolina
trump, We got South Carolina
trump, We got everybody
trump, I see Rick Perry right there
trump, Rick Perry, what are you doing here, Rick Rick Perry, one of the greats
trump, But they're all voting for me
trump, This election is about safety and this election is about jobs
trump, Today, I'm delighted to accept a very, very special endorsement from people I like
trump, Sort of grew up with these people
trump, I don't know what it is, the relationship we have with all of us, with all of us
trump, What I'm endorsing, I'm getting an endorsement tonight from some very, very special people
trump, They work hard
trump, They do great
trump, We really put them back to work because this state was in trouble
trump, At last year, you had the single greatest economic year in the history of your whole operation, right Of your whole operation
trump, You've never had anything like that
trump, This has been your greatest
trump, This has been prior to the plague coming in
trump, It's been the Commonwealth's greatest
trump, Can we ever call the Commonwealth a state You have two places
trump, But you always have to say, well, wait a minute
trump, Is this one a Commonwealth Two places
trump, You know what the other place is Name it
trump, Huh That's right
trump, How did you know that, Congressmen Huh But this Commonwealth, it's a great Commonwealth
trump, It's a great place
trump, And the boilermakers, local union, it's Local 154 of the boilermakers
trump, They chartered in Pittsburgh 125 years ago
trump, None of you were around to see it, and it now represents members in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia
trump, And I want to thank John Hughes and the boilermakers here today
trump, It's a great honor to have you
trump, Where's John Where the hell is John Stand up, John
trump, John, we appreciate it

trump, You're the heart of this country
trump, You really are
trump, Thank you very much
trump, That's a great endorsement
trump, That's a great endorsement
trump, Joe Biden spent the last 47 years shipping Pennsylvania jobs to China and foreign nations
trump, And I've spent the last four years bringing them back home and we're bringing them back home
trump, Bringing a lot of things back home
trump, I ended the last administration's eight year pure war on Pennsylvania oil, and coal, and fracking
trump, If you look at the natural gas, what they've done to this state, what they were doing to this state
trump, It was sort of easy
trump, I just opened it up and I said, Do it
trump, And the investment put into Pennsylvania, the investment put into the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has been record setting
trump, But again, you had the greatest year you've ever had last year prior to the virus
trump, You're going to be set
trump, Now with what we're doing, I believe that this next quarter, which will be announced, interestingly, just prior to the election, so I'm putting myself on the line, but I know what's going to happen
trump, The numbers are going to be great
trump, And next year is going to be one of the greatest years not only for Pennsylvania, but for the entire country
trump, So Joe Hiden, we have a new one, Joe Hiden
trump, We call him Joe Hiden
trump, I have all
trump, What do you like better What do you like better We got a number
trump, Let's do a little poll
trump, Can we do a poll I saved myself so much money
trump, You know, I saved myself so much money
trump, We do these polls with thousands, and those people are coming in from the back, are they not Yes They're coming in
trump, I'm telling you wouldn't have believed it
trump, I'm landing
trump, I wasn't waving at you
trump, I was waving at them
trump, There's more
trump, But I do these polls
trump, Right And it's like a perfect poll
trump, Do you ever see the companies You give them a million bucks and they do a poll, like 78 people were polled
trump, Now you've got thousands of people
trump, So tell me
trump, What's your feeling, first of all in the name You like MAGA, Make America Great Again Yes Oh, you are the one
trump, You are a man
trump, I made you famous today
trump, You said the nicest things about me
trump, Thank you
trump, Did you see him on television today I think you're great
trump, I think you're great
trump, Thank you
trump, No, he called me a great Christian and a great Christian leader
trump, Thank you
trump, But he did say I wasn't perfect, but that's okay
trump, I said thank you, anyway
trump, Right No, that was really great
trump, That was really great
trump, Biden- No that was really great
trump, That was really great
trump, But if you look at it, the things they've done, we're going to go through a couple of different polls as we go along because I love the people saying do this or do that
trump, But one of the things I got you out of is this thing sounds so good but it's so bad
trump, It's a rip off of our country
trump, The so-called Paris Climate Accord
trump, It's a disaster, a death sentence
trump, It's a death sentence for your energy jobs
trump, I took it out
trump, I withdrew from that calamity
trump, Biden pledged to reinstate it
trump, It's going to cost you billions and billions of dollars
trump, You know what it really is It's a way of really taking advantage of the United States
trump, This is what it is
trump, Last year I visited the Shell Petrochemical Plant in Beaver County
trump, Anybody ever hear of Beaver County The largest investment in your state's history, all made possible by our pro-energy policies
trump, Biden would wipe out that entire industry killing the jobs of more than 600,000 Pennsylvania workers
trump, It's probably 940,000 they say
trump, Think of that
trump, Also, prices and everything else
trump, Now Biden today came out and said, No, no, fracking's okay, it's okay Did you see that Fracking's okay
trump, Because he was getting killed
trump, And now we came out in favor of law enforcement
trump, Look at all these handsome cops here
trump, And a beautiful cop
trump, If you would see how beautiful, if you would see how beautiful this is, it was like this perfect evening, the sun was setting, the faces of these great, great majestic heroes of our country, right Heroes of our country
trump, And they want to blow Mount Rushmore
trump, But how about this one The Democrats yesterday came out with a plan
trump, Did you see it Now, they're the DC Democrats
trump, They want to change the name of the Washington Monument, perhaps take it down
trump, Thomas Jefferson, pretty good Thomas Jefferson, right You could forget about ever hearing that name again
trump, Abraham Lincoln, you could forget about it
trump, They want to take down all statues, all monuments in Washington
trump, We have some of your greatest people right here
trump, Let me not even talk to the congressmen
trump, The heck with the Congressman, the boiler makers
trump, How do you like How do you like the idea of taking down our statues to our great George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Jackson, all of them I don't think the boiler makers
trump, You'll do a ring around Washington right Along with Christopher Columbus
trump, He's in big trouble I'll tell you
trump, Except there was one, there was a group of great Italians in New York, they tried to take down
trump, They tried to take down Christopher Columbus statue in New York
trump, You saw what happened, right These Italians formed a little circle
trump, They said, Come on
trump, The agitators decided to leave
trump, Let's get out of here darling
trump, They protected Christopher Columbus
trump, The Italians, now the Italians aren't big on taking down Christopher Columbus
trump, You take down those statues you can forget about the Italian vote
trump, Do we agree But they protected it
trump, When asked at the debate if there would be any place for fossil fuels, including coal, and fracking, and natural gas, and so many things that really fire up these big plants where many of you work, and they produce just millions and millions of jobs throughout our country, Biden said, No, we would absolutely not allow anything like that
trump, We would make sure it's totally eliminated
trump, That's what he said
trump, He said, We would make sure it's totally eliminated or eliminated
trump, Now he's coming and saying, This isn't working too well
trump, This isn't working
trump, And I made a speech a week ago in Texas
trump, We had crowds that were unbelievable, on the highways, you can't get in, but the highways, it's like incredible
trump, You could sell your ticket tonight for a lot of money, go to eBay
trump, Even as a used ticket, you could probably sell
trump, But you go down the highways and you see it, and I was thinking of Texas, I'm making a speech in front of obviously people that like oil, they like God, and you know what else they like, they like their Second Amendment, right So think about it
trump, So whether it's Pennsylvania, or Texas, or Oklahoma, or North Dakota, or any place, you take a look at this, right And no oil, no guns, no God
trump, I don't think George Washington running with Abraham Lincoln as his VP, he'll pick Abraham Lincoln as VP is going to win in Texas, or in Pennsylvania, or any place else with those three things eliminated
trump, That's what they want to do
trump, They want to take away your Second Amendment
trump, If I weren't president, you would either have an obliterated Second Amendment or it would be gone entirely
trump, I am standing between them and your Second Amendment
trump, And that's it
trump, That's it
trump, They know
trump, We put Baido in charge of guns
trump, Baido is in charge, he wants to get rid of everything
trump, Baido, that's a beauty
trump, Remember he said, I was born for this
trump, Anybody that says they're born for this
trump, Remember Baido He was on the cover of a magazine, I won't mention the magazine, they're back there
trump, It's a total phony magazine
trump, But he was on the cover of the magazine
trump, And he said, I was born to run for president
trump, He was born for it
trump, I was born
trump, Anybody that gets that character
trump, That was when he was doing well
trump, Since then he's cratered
trump, Ever since he made that statement, he's looked very bad
trump, But take a look at what he says about guns, and he got put in charge of guns
trump, So I guess Biden pretty soon he's going to be coming out saying, No, no
trump, I never said that
trump, Check out all of the statements he's made on everything and now he's going the opposite way, but he's agreed to the manifesto entirely so maybe he'll do that
trump, And then he figures later on, he'll go
trump, But everything he said is right, because he has no control over what's happening
trump, The radical left has captured the party
trump, They even elected a person that nobody ever heard of, a senator, it's been a while, against a young, good looking Kennedy by 10 points in Massachusetts
trump, Did you know Kennedy lost in Massachusetts You know why Because he wasn't a radical left
trump, He was like a semi-normal person, just slightly left
trump, No, but think of it
trump, This is what's happened
trump, And this is really what's happened
trump, If you're not a radical lefty, meaning guns, meaning fossil fuels, they want wind, wind
trump, To make the windmill, which are made mostly in China, and in Germany, by the way, to make it, so much emission is let out, that is more than you can ever save
trump, It's just the craziest thing
trump, Also, I am truly an environmentalist, but you have to understand
trump, When we do things and they don't, and we clean, and it's very expensive to do that and they don't, and we have this massive planet, and China, India, Russia, Germany, all these places, it's fuming up and we're doing our job and beautiful
trump, No, they have to do it also
trump, Otherwise, it just doesn't work the way it's supposed to
trump, They want to ban straws
trump, Has anybody ever tried those paper straws They are not working too good
trump, Right They want to ban straws, I said, well, I've had a couple of meals at McDonald's, et cetera over the years, right Wendy's, a friend of mine owns Wendy's, I'll give it a plug, right Burger King
trump, So they want to ban straws
trump, I said, Oh really What about the carton What about the plate What about the knives and the spoons that are plastic Oh, they're okay, but the straws we got ban
trump, Has anybody ever tried, seriously, the new straw, it's made out of paper, right It disintegrates as you drink and if you have a nice tie like this tie, this would have no chance
trump, By the time you get finished, the straw is totally disintegrated
trump, Does anybody walk around with a plastic straw Because it's that bad
trump, You whip it out, boom, boom
trump, You never had to do that
trump, When asked whether he would be willing to destroy the jobs of hundreds of thousands of blue collar workers to push his anti-energy agenda, you know what the answer is, right It's the Green New Deal, right This Green New Deal
trump, This was made up by people that don't get it
trump, Either that or people that just don't like our country very much
trump, But Biden replied yes, he'll get rid of those jobs
trump, And he famously told a voter, I want you to look in my eyes, when he's not wearing the mask because I've never seen a man that liked their mask
trump, Look, I'm all for it, we have a big weekend, distance on the weekend, and all of that stuff, and wear your mask when you're close together in particular, and wash your hands, all those things
trump, We have Labor Day Weekend coming up
trump, But did you ever see a man that likes a mask as much as him And then he makes a speech and he always has it, not always, but a lot of times he has it hanging down
trump, Because you know what It gives him a feeling of security
trump, If I were a psychiatrist, right I'd say, This guy's got some big issues
trump, Hanging down
trump, Hanging down
trump, Congressman, give me your mask
trump, I want to have it hanging from my ear
trump, I don't want to touch your damn mask
trump, Mike I'll never touch your mask
trump, No, but the new one is, I went for a physical, the doctor said to me, Sir would you like to go over to Walter Reed It's incredible
trump, By the way, the job they do on people that have been just really hurt, our heroes
trump, The job they do is incredible
trump, Sir would you like to go over and do a physical You have some time
trump, You know why I had time Some deal, oh, it was China
trump, I decided not to see China because I didn't like the way they were doing business, okay Does that make sense So the doctor, White House doctor, highly respected, Sean, Sean Conley, Sir would you like to go over and do your physical, or do a piece of it, or finish it or whatever it was, but do a physic
trump, I said, I don't know
trump, I'm not in love with the idea
trump, Well, if you do it, you don't have to do… Okay
trump, Let's go
trump, Come on
trump, So we went, we went, and we're driving
trump, Now you have to understand, they're like a hundred cars
trump, You see what happens here
trump, It's like the plane times 50
trump, So the cars are driving all over to about a 20 minute drive and we get to the hospital, I get out
trump, I was there probably for an hour and a half, two hours
trump, And then yesterday I read that I had strokes
trump, CNN, fake news CNN right there
trump, No, it's true
trump, Mini strokes they called them
trump, I don't know what a mini stroke is, but it's not good
trump, And there could be a day and I'll admit, I said Hey, it happens all of us
trump, Right Except these young ones
trump, It's never going to happen to them
trump, And I'd look at it at that, but you know what happens But nothing happened
trump, So I went in, I did that part of the physical
trump, The end result was he's very healthy
trump, They were very unhappy when they heard that result
trump, What you don't remember is when this took place, it was a long time ago
trump, They just started up because they want to try and get me to be in Biden's physical level
trump, They view me as being somebody that's, I go around, hey, last week, this week, Texas, North Carolina, Florida, South Carolina, back to Washington
trump, Let's go here, let's go there, let's go everywhere
trump, Meetings all the time
trump, I think I've answered more questions from these maniacs than any president in history
trump, And mean questions
trump, I watched Biden yesterday, so he hasn't answered questions in what, two months or something
trump, And yesterday he took a couple and they were set ups like I've never seen
trump, One young woman who I think is there, one young woman is smiling, Hi, Hi, Hi, Hi
trump, I just like to ask you, I'm sorry to bother you with this question
trump, It's the most incredible
trump, So the doctor wrote a letter saying, No, this rumor is wrong
trump, And I don't like, rumors like that
trump, And by the way, if it were a fact, it's fine, it should
trump, I think it's an important thing
trump, But if it's not true, my wife was like, she came to me, she said, I think I would have known that
trump, I said, Yeah, I think they would have known it too, because they drove back with me
trump, The press follows me, they have a special deal, and then they followed me and then we go in, we go out
trump, But if you remember, last time, I go in, I spend a little time, a physical like we all have
trump, Hopefully you have them
trump, Good thing to have I guess, as long as they give you a good answer
trump, If they give you a bad answer don't bother, possibly too late
trump, But I go in, I come out a couple of hours later I guess, whatever it is, it's a short time later, I get into the car, the press sees me get into the car
trump, On my way home, I get a call from my wife, the First Lady who's very popular
trump, Do we like our First Lady Very popular, great person, great woman
trump, She said, Darling, are you okay I go, Why do you ask She said, They're reporting that you had a heart attack
trump, Now you have to understand I'm driving in a car, which is about what Six cars in front of the press, because they have a big car
trump, They're a lot of them and we try and give them as little room as possible, make it uncomfortable
trump, But they're right behind me
trump, So they know I got in and CNN reported that I had a heart attack
trump, That was the same visit, and that didn't work
trump, No it's unbelievable
trump, CNN reported I had a heart attack so my wife was concerned
trump, I said, No, not that I know of
trump, And if I did, I think I'd be back there
trump, No
trump, I'll be home in 15 minutes, darling
trump, Thank you for caring
trump, It's always nice
trump, It's always nice
trump, She sounded relieved
trump, That's good
trump, When your wife sounds relieved
trump, But she said,  I wonder how that happened
trump, Why did they do that Because they're fake news
trump, So I go in and that rumor lasted for a little while, like a day or two
trump, It lasted for a little while, no matter what I did
trump, I'm in the same motorcade, I go in, and I go out
trump, They know I'm in the motorcade, I actually have to report it, but I'm in the motorcade, and they said I had a… One of them said it was a massive heart attack
trump, Think of it
trump, Again, it could happen someday, okay And when it does, I hope things work out
trump, But they knew I'm in the motorcade and yet they reported it anyway because they fake news
trump, Now for the same visit, that was the stupidest thing
trump, From now on, when I go for a physical or something or go to the hospital, announce it because this was a quick thing
trump, The doctor, he got me in a lot of trouble
trump, He's a great doctor
trump, I said, No more surprise visits to the hospital where we do a little work because we have some time
trump, So now the same visit they started yesterday because some joker from the New York Times who's a third grade reporter writes a book and he said, The vice president was prepared to take over the reins because they thought the president was going to go, I guess, under anesthesia
trump, Do they still call it… In the old days they called it anesthesia
trump, It's essentially the same thing
trump, I don't want to get into a situation like where Biden used a record player
trump, Remember that You go home, you turn on your record player
trump, But the anesthesia
trump, And I said, How could that be So remember, this is the same visit, same visit
trump, They said heart attack a long time
trump, All of a sudden out of this book
trump, And he said, Suffered mini strokes
trump, Now they get a letter from the White House doctor that said it's totally false, totally false
trump, But they still go with it, they go with it
trump, And they know I'm in the group with them coming back
trump, And I don't know much about a mini stroke, but I assume Mr
trump, Congressman, if you have a mini stroke, you're not heading back to the White House, right At least you'll spend a couple of nights at that great hospital, right So anyway, these are really dangerous people
trump, They are so bad for our country
trump, If we had honest press, it would be so great for the USA
trump, It would be so great
trump, They're just a bunch of phony people
trump, Not all of them
trump, You have some very good ones, like about 10
trump, No, you have some very good ones, you have some great journalists, they know it's phony stuff
trump, They're doing anything they can to get this sleepy guy into the White House and I just don't think the public is going to fall for it
trump, I don't think the public is going to fall for it
trump, In his best days, 25, 30 years ago, he was weak
trump, He was weak
trump, As a Senator, he was weak
trump, He was not known as being one of the smart ones and now it's not exactly primetime, I can tell you that
trump, I just want to announce tonight because we're joined with some very, very special warriors and Dan Meuser, Dan, thank you very much
trump, Great job you're doing
trump, Dan, Congressman
trump, He's a Congressman who have really been warriors for me
trump, You really have been
trump, Thank you very much Dan
trump, Fred Keller, Fred, thank you
trump, Great job, Fred
trump, The great John Joyce
trump, Great, thank you, John
trump, Guy Reschenthaler
trump, Do you know him Guy Reschenthaler
trump, what are you doing over there What happened You don't get along with these guys Oh, okay
trump, That's good
trump, Now I understand
trump, That's good
trump, Glenn Thompson
trump, Great job, great job Glenn, really great
trump, And a real good friend of mine, right from the beginning, right, Mike We were in Pennsylvania and a friend of ours, a Congressman, longterm, right From Kentucky
trump, No, from actually Tennessee came up to us, I was getting ready to make a speech, and Tennessee is very early voting
trump, Remember what he said This was four years ago
trump, He said, I don't know what's happening in Pennsylvania
trump, I don't know what's happening in the rest of the country
trump, But if what's going on in the rest of the country is like what's going on in Tennessee He said, They're coming from the Hills, the roadsides, the rivers
trump, He said they're coming, people that never really cared to vote, they're great Americans, but they never wanted to vote for the people that they were seeing
trump, He said, They're miles long
trump, They've got Trump here, Trump hats, Trump pins, right Tennessee
trump, Duncan, Congressman Duncan, right Remember that Mike That was the first time
trump, I mean, they said that they'd never seen anything like it
trump, Tennessee has been incredible by the way
trump, So Mike and I listened and we said, I wonder what that's all about
trump, But it is true
trump, People that weren't really political people, they're coming in, and the deal here, like the Miss Universe, good old Miss Universe, right Like this, they came with hats, they came with pins, they're loaded with pins
trump, One person had hundreds of pins
trump, They never would've had a pin in their life, but they love the job that we've done and we're going to do it even better in the next four years
trump, Another great friend of mine who's a tough cookie and a great Congressman
trump, But unfortunately he's a former because he's just, I don't know
trump,, He's just a special guy and really has a big, beautiful heart, Lou Barletta, Lou
trump, You look good Lou
trump, Why don't you run again Lou And a man who is tough
trump, There's this guy
trump, You ever hear of a guy named Conor Lamb He's like a lamb
trump, So we heard, because he's in sort of a Trumpy area, right And we heard that he's going to be for Trump, but he's going to be fighting for Trump
trump, I saw some of his commercials, I thought he was a Republican, right Except when he got to Washington, he voted with Pelosi a hundred percent of the time
trump, Craziness
trump, He voted with craziness
trump, And so we thought, this Conor lamb guy, he even voted to impeach your president over nothing
trump, Zero
trump, Zero
trump, And that's very personal
trump, When they do that, that's personal
trump, And I have to say congressmen, 196 to nothing they stuck with us and so did the Senate other than Romney
trump, You can have Romney I think
trump, Remember he was walking with the Black Lives Matter saying, Yes, I'm a member of Black Lives Matter
trump, Everyone said, That's nice
trump, Wonderful
trump, He had a lot of mask on, I'll tell you that
trump, But we did a great job, it was an amazing thing
trump, But this Conor Lamb was out there fighting it, and he shouldn't have done that
trump, And we have somebody that blows him away
trump, He's more of a hero, he's tougher, he's stronger, he's smarter, he's better looking, not that, that matters
trump, Under the me too generation, I don't talk about looks anymore
trump, Looks don't matter
trump, Doesn't make any difference
trump, I don't talk about looks
trump, Me too
trump, Me too generation
trump, But I'll tell you, this man is something special
trump, He's a real hero, a real tough guy, and he'll never let you down, Sean Parnell
trump, Just remember that Conor lamb, and I remember, because he's like a lamb, he's like a little lamb
trump, Weak, got a lot of weak people
trump, We like strong people, don't we We like strong people
trump, We need strong people right now
trump, We have somebody else in the audience who served as my Secretary of Energy and he was incredible
trump, He was the Governor of Texas for what 12 years I think
trump, Rick right 12 Tell me
trump, 14 14 years he was
trump, And he was an incredible governor, and he was an incredible secretary, and he's been an incredible friend
trump, Rick Perry everybody
trump, There was nobody that got into the race tougher than Rick
trump, What he said about me, I'll never repeat again
trump, Even my own family didn't like me when he got finished
trump, And when he decided that I would be the one, he got out and there's nobody that's said better things about me
trump, But you're great Rick, and you did a fantastic job
trump, Every place you've been, you've been great
trump, Thank you very much
trump, Rick Perry
trump, Thank you
trump, Hey Rick, how are we doing in Texas 00, the polls closed and they only announce if you're way ahead
trump, So they say, The polls have closed in the great state of Texas, Donald Trump has won the great state of Texas
trump, … Hillary even beat this guy
trump, Hillary
trump, Hillary came in second in Utah
trump, This week my administration reached a breakthrough agreement to stop additional steel imports from Brazil and from Mexico for the rest of the year despite the USMCA, sometimes they get a little carried away and we have to do a little tariff action on them
trump, So we stopped that
trump, We're reversing decades of the Biden betrayals that decimated Pennsylvania jobs, you know that
trump, This state lost, listen to this, one in three manufacturing jobs after the twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance into the World Trade Organizations, one of the worst things that happened, when China came in
trump, They were flat-lined for many years, then they came into this crazy deal
trump, They're considered a developing nation, you see I've been sort of protesting that like, but they're considering China as a developing nation, you get all sorts of things that you would never get, advantages over the United States
trump, Well we have very strongly protested that
trump, They're not a developing nation, they're a very powerful developed nation, and you know what They got to pay what everyone else has to pay
trump, Earlier this year I kept my promise to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania when we ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand new U
trump,S
trump,-Mexico-Canada agreement into law which is in effect now and really doing well
trump, Everyone said it will never happen, and I had great help from these gentlemen right here
trump, I took the toughest ever action to stand up to China's pillaging, plundering and rampant theft of Pennsylvania and many other places, jobs
trump, That's all throughout the world by the way but our states have been just pillaged by China and others
trump, Joe Biden's agenda is made in China, my agenda is made in America
trump, After years and years of rebuilding other countries, we are finally rebuilding our country, it's called America First
trump, We're America First, that's enough, and we're bringing our soldiers back home
trump, You see what's going on
trump, After 19 years in Afghanistan, far away places, to bring hope to our inner cities, I created opportunity zones, Tim Scott, great senator from South Carolina worked on it with me
trump, Passed criminal justice reform, delivered permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities that Obama would never do and before the China virus we achieved the lowest African-American, Hispanic-American, Asian-American unemployment rates ever recorded by far
trump, And they're now heading back in that direction quickly
trump, Democrat politicians have failed the black community for decades, they've failed the Asian community, the Hispanic community
trump, They failed women
trump, The numbers on women's unemployment were the best in 61 years
trump, Biden spent the last 47 years betraying the American people
trump, He was always for things that you wouldn't want and now he's changing, No, I never said that
trump, I never said that
trump, I've spent the last four years keeping my promises and delivering for the African-American community and for all communities and the best is yet to come
trump, Perhaps in no area have our opponents more thoroughly betrayed working families of all backgrounds and on the subject of immigration, we've been fighting for that
trump, Under my administration we achieved the most secure border in American history
trump, We ended catch and release, stopped asylum fraud, and we've deported 20,000 gang members and we get them out and we get them out fast
trump, Thank you ICE
trump, ICE and Border Patrol
trump, ICE and Border Patrol
trump, They don't like ICE because ICE is, they're tough
trump, You got to be tough in that job by the way
trump, Anybody up here like to work in ICE I don't think so
trump, Let's see, you could probably be okay but you'd rather do what you're doing, right I agree with you
trump, These are tough guys, they have to be tough
trump, These are bad, bad gang members
trump, I mean you look at MS-13, you look at what's happened with MS-13, you look at … We get them the hell out
trump, Sometimes we have to put them in prison because we don't even want to take a chance, they can come back in after what they've done, we had thieves, we had some very bad people in the VA and they're all gone
trump, Thank you, I love you too, thank you
trump, Thank you
trump, Such friendly voices
trump, Quite beautiful
trump, Only in Pennsylvania, right Thank you
trump, I withdrew from the last administration's disastrous Iran nuclear deal, think of this
trump, Obama paid 150 billion for a short-term deal
trump, He gave 1
trump,8 billion in cash
trump, You ever see a million dollars like at a casino floor or something in 100 bills It's a lot, it's like the size of this, right Now think 1
trump,8 billion
trump, How did you guys allow that to happen They said we all voted against it
trump, I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel
trump, You never know nowadays, right And I opened the U
trump,S
trump, embassy in Jerusalem
trump, I recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights
trump, They've been trying to get that done for 52 years, I got it done immediately
trump, By the way, as far as the capital of Israel, Jerusalem, they've been talking about many, many presidents
trump, They all promised it, nobody did it
trump, I did it
trump, We get things done, and we just did something that is incredible
trump, Even the New York Times gave it good reviews, not good reviews, beyond good reviews
trump, Tom Friedman gave it phenomenal reviews, you believe that That's we achieved the first breakthrough in Middle East peace in decades, a deal with Israel and the UAE
trump, It's a deal with Israel and the UAE and that's going to lead and I'm going to tell you we have representatives over right now and other people are saying we want to get in that deal
trump, You'll have peace in the Middle East
trump, We want to get the hell out
trump, Let's get them all back
trump, Let's get thel all back
trump, Don't forget, we're energy independent
trump, There used to be a reason
trump, Now we do have a reason, it's called Israel, and we have some very good partnerships over there
trump, In all fairness we have some countries that have treated us very well and we're going to take care of those countries, but we are energy independent for the first time and that's a very good feeling
trump, Our military has never been stronger than it is now
trump, It's new and it's beautiful and I told you we took over 100 of the ISIS caliphate in Iraq and Syria and we killed the founder and leader of ISIS al-Baghdadi, and separately, we killed the world's number one terrorist, number one terrorist for decades and decades, Qasem Soleimani
trump, We killed Soleimani
trump, It's a big step for the Middle East
trump, We kept America out of wars
trump, Remember they always said, Oh, this Trump
trump, He's radical, he's really, I mean he's off the … He's too radical
trump, He'll get us in wars
trump, I kept us out of wars, what happened with North Korea Look, I get along with Kim Jong-un
trump, They say, That's terrible he gets along
trump, No it's good if I get along
trump, If I get along with Russia, is that a good thing or a bad thing I think it's a good thing
trump, These guys only fight to tie, they don't fight to win, you fight to win
trump, You look at what's happening where they're all coming back home
trump, I even reduced in Germany because Germany, they're an ally, but you know, they took advantage of us very badly on trade and very badly with our military
trump, So we removed a lot of soldiers out of Germany
trump, They're not happy, they said, This is going to hurt our economy
trump, Well it's good for our economy, okay They thought it was going to hurt the German economy
trump, Well, they don't treat us right, they don't pay their bills, they're delinquent
trump, You know what delinquent is They're delinquent
trump, They don't pay their bills
trump, We protect them, they don't pay their bills
trump, We got to do something and they treat us horribly on trade through the European Union which basically they run
trump, Together we've been rapidly fixing a half a century of disasters and Biden was there for every one of them
trump, Joe Biden supported NAFTA, China's entry into the World Trade
trump, He supported the Korean deal, the Korean deal was so bad, it was so bad
trump, This was a deal that was going to produce to South Korea done by Crooked Hillary Clinton, this was a deal that was going to produce 250,000 jobs
trump, She said,  This will be 250,000, and she was right, for South Korea
trump, It produced 250,000 jobs
trump, For us, we got nothing
trump, We got losses, we got nothing
trump, It was a terrible deal, I renegotiated, now it's a good deal
trump, They also gave and want to give mass amnesty for illegal aliens
trump, Biden supported cutting Social Security
trump, He voted for the Iraq War, he opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden
trump, He opposed the killing of Soleimani, when I did that, he said, That's a terrible thing
trump, That's a terrible thing
trump, Everybody in the Middle East, they couldn't believe it
trump, They celebrated, some of them quite quietly I must add
trump, Sign your mail-in ballot
trump, You sign it and send it in and then you have to follow it and if on Election Day or early voting, that is not tabulated and counted, you go vote, and then if for some reason after that, it shouldn't take that long, it comes in, they're not going to be able to tabulate it because you will have voted
trump, But you have to make sure your vote counts because the only way they're going to beat us is by doing that kind of stuff
trump, I'm trying to be nice
trump, I'm trying to be nice
trump, They want to send out congressmen 80 million ballots
trump, Now there have been many races over the last year where they've done this and they've been a disaster
trump, You look at New York, they had a congressional race, not a very good congresswoman, very untalented, I know her well, I lived in New York
trump, She's not got much going
trump, They have no idea what the vote is, I think 20 of the ballots were missing and then they declared her the winner and the other guy said, What about me He's not too happy, her opponent
trump, You look at what happened in Paterson, New Jersey, you look at what happened in Virginia, you look at what happened … There's not a race, and these are small, these are easy to control
trump, they want to send out 80 million unsolicited, I like it much better, they used to say universal, they used to say live ballots, I like the word unsolicited, and solicited
trump, Solicited is okay, because that's when you're asking and you want it and you send in the necessary paperwork and documentation and you get the ballot and you fill it out, that's okay
trump, But you can't, this whole thing with the unsolicited, unsolicited means you're sitting there
trump, We have a big enthusiasm edge, but when they throw these things in your face and the lists are inaccurate and people are dead and dogs have gotten ballots, they have
trump, Dogs have gotten ballots and they know I'm right and everybody knows I'm right and they say I'm right behind the closed doors and it's a disgrace, what they do to our country
trump, 80 million unsolicited ballots
trump, People that had no idea
trump, People that weren't going to vote in all fairness
trump, It's really unfair because our people have enthusiasm, they're going out to vote
trump, They're all going out to vote
trump, Everybody here going to vote Everybody They have no enthusiasm
trump, So I said, So that's unfair
trump, That guy walks and then they'll have somebody knock on the door, say, Listen, I would like your ballot
trump, I don't want to vote
trump, I don't care about Biden
trump, I'm a Democrat
trump, I don't care about this guy
trump, Well look, where is it Here take it, blah blah blah
trump, They even have a provision where you don't have to verify signatures
trump, What is going on And they have another provision in some states where you can harvest, that's where you grab them all together and drop them
trump, In Nevada, they actually have a provision where they don't have to be counted until seven days after the election
trump, So that means if we have a close election, could be close, I hope it's not, I hope we have a landslide like you've never seen
trump, But if we have a close election that means Nevada has the right to, and I love Nevada, I think we're going to win Nevada, except where they're sending all these hundreds of thousands, millions of unsolicited ballots to people in Nevada and people that probably left a long time ago
trump, It's very unfair, it's very unfair, but think of it
trump, They have seven days after the election
trump, Did you know that Mike Seven days, what does that mean I want to see the results of the election on November 3
trump, By the way, if it's anything like these other events, it could go on forever
trump, I mean the congressional race which they just gave up and they declared her a winner which they should not have done, they should make that a do-over and I think in Paterson they have a do-over
trump, I think they're going to do it over because it was just ripe with fraud, theft
trump, People were selling ballots, people were selling ballots, and you know they talk about Russia
trump, They're so worried about Russia
trump, What about sending out 80 million ballots That's your real problem, and if Russia or China or these other countries want to cheat, all they have to do is forge ballots
trump, It's much easier than the way they have to go about it, right So we have to put pressure on these people
trump, Now the good news is we have a lot of court cases we have won in Pennsylvania, you know that, right We have two judges, we have a state judge, we have a federal judge
trump, I think both highly qualified judges from what I understand, I hear that they're not too happy about what they're seeing
trump, So we'll see what happens
trump, We're going to see what happens
trump, The lawyers feel very confident but we have to win those cases but what you have to do is send in your early ballot and then go and make sure that ballot is tabulated or counted, and if it's not counted, vote, and then they have the job, if it comes in late, and if it's not too late, they have the job of making sure that they don't count it
trump, But follow that ballot because these people, they'll be lost, they'll be gone, the numbers are incredible where they're 25 and 30 off, 20 off
trump, Follow your ballot
trump, When I banned travel from China, Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic
trump, If we had listened to Sleepy Joe hundreds of thousands of more Americans would have died
trump, You know that
trump, You know he always gets up today, COVID-19, COVID-19
trump, I say, Joe, look
trump, We got a country, and I agree with that and we've done a hell of a job
trump, We've done a hell of a job
trump, If you look at some of our numbers
trump, You got to start talking about the economy and you got to start talking, your place, I mean this is … When you look at Pennsylvania, you're in a shutdown
trump, You have a governor that has you shut down we know the susceptible are old people, senior citizens, nursing homes
trump, People that are old, especially if they have heart problems or if they have diabetes
trump, We know that, we learned it, and we opened it up
trump, But the problem these shutdowns are causing much bigger problems
trump, You remember my original statement, right The cure can't be greater
trump, It was an original statement that a lot of people picked up but it's so true
trump, You have to open up this commonwealth, it has to be opened up
trump, It has to be opened up now
trump, But there's what I think they're doing, because you have the same thing in New York
trump, We have a governor in New York who is 36,000 people died, 11,000 people in a nursing home because he made a mistake
trump, He made a horrible mistake, and I built him a convention center with 2,800 beds and they didn't use it and I sent up a ship, a great hospital ship, a massive hospital with hundreds and hundreds of rooms and they didn't use it and he requested it and then I said, You're not using it
trump, Why aren't you using it He could have put those people in the convention center in the hospital ship
trump, What a shame how long can you do this for Restaurant, poor guys
trump, You can't, how long can you do this for The people are going to lose their jobs
trump, They're never going to open again
trump, It's not like the restaurants is the greatest business in the world
trump, It's a hard business
trump, New York is closed
trump, You're closed
trump, North Carolina's closed
trump, Michigan's … all Democrats
trump, Let me tell you, what's going to happen on November 4th
trump, They're going to announce their opening
trump, They're doing this for political reasons
trump, They are
trump, Right, John They're doing it for political reasons because they want our numbers to look as bad as possible, going into November 3rd, election day
trump, Then as soon as the election's over with, win, lose or draw for them, they're going to open it
trump, They got nothing
trump, You know what It's a shame what they're doing
trump, For political reasons, they'll be open
trump, You'll be open on November 4th, but you know what From your standpoint, it's very close to the election
trump, It's very far if you have a restaurant, and you can't open your restaurant
trump, You can't open your store
trump, It's a disgrace and they ought to get together
trump, They ought to do it
trump, These are Democrat governors in all instances and Democrat mayors
trump, When the China virus arrived, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II
trump, Thanks to the life- saving therapies that we pioneered, the mortality rate has been reduced by 85 since April
trump, Think of that
trump, We've achieved among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country, anywhere in the world
trump, You never hear that from the fake news
trump, They don't want to talk to you about it
trump, This is a big country
trump, This is a tougher country to do that with, the European Union's case fatality rate is nearly three times higher than ours
trump, If you look now, Spain is having a big blow up
trump, France is having a big blow up
trump, Now, we've done a great job, we haven't been given credit for it
trump, He always starts off, COVID-19
trump, That's all he knows
trump, COVID-19
trump, I said, What about the economy What about jobs What about all the other things we have to do All he does, he thinks it's a weak spot, and actually in theory, if we're getting a fair shake from those people back there, it's actually what the job we've done is actually a strong spot
trump, That includes you people, with the ventilators that nobody had
trump, Nobody that needed a ventilator, didn't get a ventilator
trump, Now we're supplying them all over the world
trump, Altogether, the nations of Europe have experienced a 30 greater increase in excess mortality than the United States
trump, Think of that
trump, You don't hear these numbers
trump, Cases in the US have declined by 28 nationwide over the last month, and hospitalizations and deaths have declined radically over the last week
trump, Three vaccines are in final stage of clinical trials
trump, Would have taken two years for another president
trump, I was going to say a normal president, but they'll hit me with … A little truth to that too
trump, Now, but for another president, especially, in the last administration, they had the H1N1 pandemic
trump, It was called Swine flu
trump, You know, Joe always calls it the N1H1
trump, He gets it mixed up
trump, No, it's the H1N1, Joee
trump, Not that it matters, I guess
trump, No
trump, Do you ever notice, he's always calling it the other
trump, He calls it the opposite
trump, He has no clue where he is, but he keeps saying, Oh, if he was, well he didn't want the ban China, and we saved hundreds of thousands of lives by banning China
trump, I was the only one that wanted to do it, actually
trump, Then we banned Europe because I saw what was happening in Italy and Spain and France
trump, We banned Europe
trump, We saved hundreds of thousands
trump, If I didn't do the closing and the opening, so we're at 175,000, far too … look, one is too much because this was given to us by China, and it's a disgrace
trump, It's a disgrace
trump, They could have stopped it
trump, They stopped it from going into China, but not going to the rest of the world, including our country
trump, It's a disgrace
trump, But think of it
trump, Joe Biden got the worst marks you've ever seen for his handling of the H1NI Swine flu
trump, They said it was incompetent, and the head guy, who now he's trying to retract
trump, It's a little tough
trump, That's one great thing about the tape
trump, He said it was horrible
trump, He said, we did a horrible job
trump, He said, they got lucky
trump, It's not contagious like this
trump, We got, this is a tough one
trump, I can look at that guy and he'll catch it
trump, Right there, and he's very far away from me
trump, It's a tough one, because it's so contagious
trump, I tell you what, our Vice-President, Mike Pence, and the task force, headed up by Mike and working along with a lot of great people, they've done a fantastic job and they just get no credit
trump, If I was a Democrat, a different president, and they did the same job, they'd say it was one of the greatest jobs they've ever seen
trump, But take a look at what they say about the way they handled the Swine flu
trump, It was a disaster
trump, It was incompetent
trump, They called themselves incompetent
trump, They call, and now they're coming in like, well, we would have done this and Biden by the way, was against, you remember, xenophobic, racist, because I closed down China
trump, Then two months later, two and a half, three, and Nancy Pelosi was having dances in Chinatown, right A month later
trump, No, no problem
trump, I was way ahead
trump, Then Biden comes out and he actually said that I was right, but they said, Don't say that, try doing it a little softer than that
trump, He did it a little bit softer, but we were right
trump, They were wrong
trump, They handled it so badly
trump, Just take a look, because we, I said to my people, We've got to fight this a little bit differently because we're getting a lot of fake news, a lot of bad people saying things, and you look at the stats and you look at how we've done compared to really much easier and much smaller countries, it's amazing
trump, If you took New York out of it, which was a disaster by Cuomo, if you took New York out of those numbers, we would have numbers that would be even better than they are
trump, I could read numbers that would be even much better, because a big percentage of the people that died in this country died because New York was incompetently run by Mayor de Blasio and Governor Cuomo
trump, By the way, just today, there's another credible thing happening
trump, Pfizer, great company, announced that it expects to have the results of its vaccine trials in a matter of weeks, very shortly
trump, Incredible
trump, Under Operation Warp Speed, we remain on track to produce a safe and effective vaccine, in that record time that we talked about
trump, This would have been years later
trump, It'll be delivered before, in my opinion, before the end of the year, but it really might even be delivered before the end of October
trump, How do you like that Wouldn't that be nice That would be nice
trump, You know why Not because of the electric
trump, It'll be nice because we want to save people
trump, That's why it'll be nice
trump, That's the important thing
trump, Together, we will defeat the virus
trump, The job we're doing is, the job that all of the people working on it, our generals, our admirals, the distribution, we bought billions and billions of dollars of things, and now we make gowns and we make masks and we make shields and we make ventilators
trump, Very tough
trump, The ventilator's very complicated, very big, very expensive
trump, It's like, I made the statement, it's like building a car, but more sophisticated
trump, They said, No, it's not
trump, They said, they took a ventilator
trump, They took it apart
trump, These people are the worst, the worst
trump, Over the next four years, we'll make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world, and we will end our reliance on China once and for all
trump, That's what we'll do
trump, Let me just tell you something
trump, If they didn't waste a year and a half of my life on a ridiculous impeachment, based on a phone call that was perfect, this stuff would have all been done
trump, Would have all been done, truly
trump, It would have all been done
trump, Yet, with all of this stuff, the fake Russia witch hunt, the fake Ukraine
trump, How about that Did anybody read the transcript of that call It was a perfect call
trump, Hey, congratulations
trump, Good luck
trump, It was like a perfect call
trump, Now they'll take it back and they'll say, Well, I don't know
trump, This was a per … In history, there's never been anything like this
trump, It was a totally lopsided, 100 political witch hunt, and it goes on and on
trump, These are bad people
trump, I really believe they don't love our country
trump, I watched Nancy Pelosi
trump, You must wear your mask
trump, You have to wear your mask, and we're going to keep every beauty salon closed in California and all over the country
trump, Then I see a picture
trump, I say, Nancy Pelosi
trump, Well, where's the mask I'll tell you what
trump, She must have treated that beauty salon owner pretty badly
trump, She uses the salon and the salon turned her in The salon turned her in
trump, I don't think I would have turned her in
trump, I would've said, Well, you know, she's a customer
trump, I got to take care of my customers, right But she made them open, and the salon turned her in and the salon did business with her
trump, How much do they hate Nancy Pelosi Then she made a terrible mistake because you want people that can't be set up
trump, She said, I was set up
trump, I was set up by the salon owner
trump, I was set up
trump, I said, Tell me she didn't say that, please
trump, I just put out, that if she was set up, then she shouldn't be leading the House of Representatives
trump, I want the salon owner to lead the House of Representatives, because she set up … Think of it
trump, She set up the Speaker of the House
trump, That was a big mistake
trump, As soon as I heard, she said, Well, she's sent me up, Nancy, you're not supposed to get set up
trump, You're representing our country
trump, You know what she should have done honestly She should have said, I made a mistake, sorry, and nobody would be talking about, this is like the biggest story
trump, This is the big, crazy Nancy, highly overrated person
trump, Let me just say she is a highly overrated person
trump, They give her such good play
trump, She is a highly overrated person
trump, Look, they just turned off a camera because they don't want me saying that
trump, Just in closing, we will rapidly return to full employment, soaring wages and record prosperity
trump, We will hire more police, increased penalties for assault on law enforcement
trump, Surge federal prosecutors into high-crime communities and ban sanctuary cities
trump, We will appoint prosecutors, judges, and justices who believe in enforcing the law, not their own political agenda
trump, We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms
trump, We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens
trump, We will not let them threaten our citizens, and we will keep America out of endless foreign wars
trump, We will end surprise medical billing
trump, We don't want surprise medical billing
trump, You know what happens It's terrible, but we have ended it
trump, Also, we've signed something that's incredible
trump, You're going to see
trump, Some people say it's bigger than healthcare, and I signed it
trump, Unfortunately it takes place on January 1st
trump, You better elect me
trump, You better elect me
trump, It's called price transparency
trump, I said to my people at the end of the day, what is price transparency This is going to lower your prices by 50
trump, You'll be able to negotiate
trump, You'll be able to do things you're not even allowed to do now, with hospitals, with doctors
trump, You get better doctors, you get lower prices
trump, I said, When does it start It's a complicated … Oh, did I get, I was fought
trump, You have no idea
trump, Right fellows You have fought too
trump, But they fought me on this price transparency
trump, It's bigger than healthcare, could be bigger than healthcare
trump, But I said, When does it start They said, Sir, we have it all set
trump, When January 1st, I said, I'd better win this election, because you're going to see some unbelievable price reductions
trump, That includes on drugs, because we're reducing health insurance premiums massively, and the cost of prescription drugs went down the first time in 51 years, last year
trump, But now it's going to go down very big, because we did a favorite nation's clause
trump, I see the drug companies are, they're killing me with ads
trump, They have nothing but cash
trump, They have nothing but money
trump, They're spending because they can't believe … Germany and other countries pay much less than we do
trump, We want to have, what we have to have, is we have to have a comparison of prices
trump, That's what it is called, favored nation clause
trump, I instituted a favorite, so we're paying 2
trump,50 for a pill, and some nation is paying 25 cents for the same exact pill from the same factory, right We get the 25 cent price
trump, So, what's going to happen that'll go up
trump, Ours will come way down
trump, They can't believe it
trump, The drug companies can't believe, and I will tell you, Mark Meadows is here, our Chief of Staff
trump, Where's Mark They want to negotiate
trump, They called
trump, We signed it
trump, It's all done
trump, They want to negotiate and they are negotiating, so let's see what happens, but we're going to get you cuts on prescription drugs, the likes of which you've never seen
trump, We'll protect Medicare and Social Security
trump, They will not be able to protect it
trump, It will always protect patients with preexisting conditions, always
trump, America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars
trump, When I took over, NASA was dead
trump, Now it's the most vibrant space center in the world, by far
trump, We will restore patriotic education to our schools and we'll teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag
trump, We will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God, We Trust
trump, For years, you had a president who apologized for America
trump, Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Pennsylvania us
trump, It's where the army weathered its brutal winter at Valley Forge, and where General George Washington, who, by the way, they want all of the name, Washington removed from everything
trump, I haven't been keeping up with it
trump, What did he do George Washington, they want the name off
trump, Congressman are we okay showing … I don't think you liked that idea too much
trump, George Washington
trump, They want his name off everything, but we'll keep it
trump, I promise you this
trump, As long as you canceled culture, you better have a strong president
trump, Canceled culture
trump, George Washington, can you believe But he led his men on a daring mission across the Delaware
trump, This is the Commonwealth where our union was saved by the heroes of Gettysburg and where generations of tough, strong Pennsylvania workers, mined the coal, worked the railroads, forged the steel that made America into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of world
trump, That's in the history of the world and we are making it greater than it's ever been before
trump, That's what's going to happen

trump, We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God
trump, America will soon be thriving like never before
trump, Next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country, and together we will work very hard

trump, But, we will make America wealthy
trump, Again

trump, We will make America proud again
trump, We will make America safe again and we will make America great again
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you, Pennsylvania
trump,
trump,Thank you very much and thank you to the original Lee Greenwood
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you, Lee
trump, Great guy
trump, Well, I just want to say a very big hello, Kentucky Great place
trump, It's great to be here in the home of a group called the Wildcats
trump, You ever hear the Kentucky Wildcats By the way, they play at a very big arena
trump, This place
trump, Look at this
trump, Hello, up there This is incredible
trump, With thousands of proud, hardworking, freedom-loving American patriots, which is what you are
trump, What you are
trump, Tomorrow, the people of Kentucky will head to the polls and you will vote to reelect your terrific Republican governor, Matt Bevin
trump, He's done a fantastic job
trump, He's done a fantastic job
trump, And we're sending a signal by doing that to the rest of the country, to the rest of the world, that the republican party, you know what we stand for
trump, But you see what's happening with the Democrats, they have gone crazy
trump, The do nothing Democrats, and they're not getting it done
trump, Under Republican leadership, the economy is booming, wages are rising, confidence is soaring
trump, Kentucky is thriving like never ever before, and America is stronger than ever before
trump, True
trump, Kentucky's unemployment rate has reached the lowest point in the history of our country
trump, That's not bad
trump, And I want to just tell you that you have incredible representatives, and the job that Matt Bevin has done as governor, he's had to do some things that you had to do
trump, And he's done unbelievably well
trump, It sets you up to be a rocket ship in the future
trump, You had to do it
trump, So I just want to thank him for having the courage to do what he had to do
trump, You have the best numbers you've ever had in the history of the state
trump, And with the help of your Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, we have confirmed 157 judges to follow the constitution as written
trump, We're supporting our police, we're rebuilding our military, we're defeating radical Islamic terrorists like never before
trump, The monsters animal known as Al-Baghdadi is dead
trump, And the man that took his place is dead also
trump, American Special Forces gave the world's number one terrorist a one way ticket to hell
trump, No enemy on earth stands a chance against the awesome power of the United States military, which is now stronger than ever before
trump, We've rebuilt it and it was all made in America
trump, All made in America
trump, And our country is winning again, and our country is highly respected again
trump, But while we are creating jobs and killing terrorists, the radical democrats are going totally insane
trump, They want to obliterate the rule of law, drive out faith from the public square, and you know this, silence you online, confiscate your guns
trump, You better be careful
trump, The Second Amendment very, very important, very precious
trump, They are after your Second Amendment
trump, With us, nobody's touching our Second Amendment
trump, And that includes the gentleman that's running against Matt
trump, They're after your Second Amendment
trump, We can't let that happen
trump, They want to indoctrinate your children, you know this, destroy anyone who calls traditional America American values
trump, All you have to do is ask the boys from Covington Catholic High School
trump, Some of whom are here tonight
trump, The far left wants to impose their authoritarian ideology on the nation, telling you what to think, what to believe and how you should live
trump, They want to erase our traditions, our culture, our history, and our heroes
trump, They want to subjugate you and break you to their will, but Kentucky will never be broken
trump, Kentucky can't be broken
trump, You're too strong and you're too smart
trump, In their craze thirst for power, the democrats are trying to tear our country apart
trump, First, Democrats engineer the Russia hoax, the most egregious fraud ever foisted upon the American people, the Russian hoax
trump, Then they did the Mueller scam
trump, You remember that The Mueller scam
trump, Two years and they said nothing
trump, And then Mr
trump, Mueller testified
trump, That was a wonderful day for me
trump, You remember last week
trump, I don't know Tulsi Gabbard, but Hillary Clinton said that Tulsi Gabbard is a Russian agent
trump, I don't know Jill Stein
trump, She's a Greenie and that's fine
trump, She's a Greenie, Jill Stein
trump, But Jill Stein was an agent of Russia also
trump, These people are crazy
trump, Now corrupt politicians, Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff, they are corrupt
trump, And Nancy, unlike Kentucky, which is doing great, Nancy ought stop wasting time, go back to her district in San Francisco, help the homeless, get rid of the drugs, get rid of the needles that are lying all over the street, and all of the things that are washing into the ocean through their storm sewer system
trump, What's happened is San Francisco and what's happened to so many other places run by the radical left Democrats, it's unbelievable
trump, Los Angeles
trump, You take a look at Los Angeles, looks like a third world city
trump, But go back to Nancy's area, look at what's happened
trump, There's been no place in the country that's gone down like the area that Nancy Pelosi represents
trump, And she's wasting all of her time
trump, And you know what, it's backfiring
trump, You see it
trump, But the media and the democrats have launched an even more brazen assault on our nation, with a deranged hyperpartisan impeachment witch-hunt
trump, Impeachment
trump, Think of it
trump, So today, we just hit the highest number in the history of the stock market
trump, Now, that's hundreds of days
trump, So last week, think of this, in the history of our country, it's never done better
trump, And by the way, that's not rich, that's not poor, that's for everybody
trump, Your 401s, how you are doing Pretty good, right Pretty good
trump, People tell me that their wives, their husbands, all of a sudden, they've been running the 401s for years
trump, And they totally lost respect for let's say, the husband, totally lost respect
trump, Now they think he's a financial genius because he's up 74
trump, She says, darling, I love you
trump, You are the most incredible, brilliant financial mind
trump, And you know what, if the Democrats get in, that's not going down by 50, that's going down to nothing
trump, It's going to be worthless
trump, It's going to be worthless
trump, You'll have a depression the likes of which you've never seen
trump, Mark my words
trump, But hopefully, we don't have to even think about it
trump, And that was going to happen here
trump, When we took over, that was going down in the wrong direction
trump, And don't forget, that was zero interest
trump, We're paying interest
trump, In other words, people are now getting interest in their money
trump, But that was with zero interest, real easy with zero interest
trump, Last week, the democrats voted to try and nullify the balance of 10s of millions of Americans
trump, To be exact 63 million people, disgracing themselves and bringing shame upon the House of Representatives
trump, They've been plotting to overthrow the election since the first hour that we won
trump, And actually, before we won, they were plotting to overthrow this election
trump, Before we won
trump, 19 minutes after I took the oath of office, that disgusting Washington Post, look at all these people back there, look
trump, Fake news media
trump, It's the fake news
trump, Look at all of them
trump, What they don't know is that when we hang it up in 5 years or 9 years, or 13 years, or maybe 17 years, or maybe if I still have the strength, 21 years
trump, See, now they're going crazy
trump, Now they're saying, see, I told you, he was a dictator
trump, He wants to take charge in control of our country
trump, These people are crazy said
trump, The guy goes, well, we're going to fight and we're going to … No, no
trump, He's going to win
trump, You know he's never leaving office, don't you He's never going to leave office
trump, These people are crazy
trump, They're crazy
trump, But that disgusting newspaper that's right there, The Washington Post, declared the campaign to impeach President Trump has just begun
trump, All right, you can get them out
trump, Be gentle, be gentle
trump, Be very gentle
trump, You know every time I say, get them out of here, I end up getting sued
trump, They say, he hurt my arm
trump, All right
trump, So be very gentle, please
trump, I don't want to get sued
trump, Be very gentle
trump, Very, very gentle
trump, He's going home to mom
trump, Thank you
trump, By the way, do we love our law enforcement And in the whole world, even on a Monday Night, I like the Monday Nights because I think we're 58 and 0, that's a good record
trump, Even for the Wildcats, that's a good
trump, We're 58 and 0, but even on a Monday Night, is there anything cooler than being at a Trump rally Nothing can
trump, With last week's vote, the far left has declared war on American democracy itself
trump, These people are lunatics
trump, In the face of these attacks, Republicans are the most unified that I've ever seen, and I've been watching them and been a big part of them for a long time
trump, And the democrats have never witnessed anything like it, and they know they're not going to win in 2020
trump, So let's see what can we do to win, but that's not working too well
trump, You'll see
trump, The American people are fed up with Democrat lies, hoaxes, slander
trump, The Democrats outrageous conduct has created an angry majority that will vote the do nothing democrats the hell out of office soon
trump, Tomorrow, Kentucky has a chance to send the radical Democrats a message
trump, You will vote to reject Democrats extremism, socialism and corruption, and you will vote to reelect Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin who's done a great job
trump, Matt's a veteran
trump, He's a patriot
trump, He's done it all
trump, He's been a very, very successful business leader
trump, He put his whole life at stake to help this state and the job he's done is incredible
trump, Under his leadership, Kentucky has created over 57,000 new jobs, but I helped also
trump, We work together
trump, Now, he is difficult
trump, I have to say, you know, maybe because of the election, but it's okay
trump, Look, he's such a pain, when he needs something for Kentucky like money, like aid, like, he wants me to call one of the many manufacturers now that are coming into Kentucky
trump, Could you call the head of Some company in Japan, please I say, Matt, do I have to do it Please, please
trump, But isn't that really what you wanted in a governor That's what you want
trump, He's such a pain in the ass, but that's what you want
trump, And the job he's done, one of the best in the country
trump, Not the best
trump, He's been incredible
trump, Matt is strong on crime and tough on illegal immigration
trump, Thank you
trump, He's pro-worker, pro-life and 100 Pro-Second Amendment
trump, By the way, you're going to lose your Second Amendment if you vote in Democrats
trump, You think I'm kidding I see what they're saying
trump, I watch what they're doing
trump, They're calling me all the time
trump, You will lose your Second Amendment as soon … I'm telling you
trump, As sure as you're standing here, is anybody sitting Nobody ever sits
trump, You can sit if you want
trump, No, just stand
trump, You know what they say in the fake news Look, you've been standing
trump, Nobody sat I don't know
trump, Isn't that exciting Nobody sat
trump, You know what they say No, you know what they say They say, Trump only got one standing ovation
trump, Because they stood at the beginning and they never sat down, but they don't say the second part
trump, It's great
trump, Great spirit
trump, You know why You love our country
trump, And you see what's happening
trump, We have turned this big monster ship
trump, We have turned it around
trump, And we need so badly
trump, You know, it's like you plant a tree
trump, It takes a lot
trump, We have to get those roots to hold
trump, We have the best unemployment numbers in the history of our country, so many things
trump, So many things
trump, The best employment numbers, we have the best of everything
trump, And I think I'm going to count but I think it's like 118
trump, I told you, we have a record stock market today
trump, I think about 100 … I'm going to have to check it
trump, Because you know with the fake news, if I'm off by half a point
trump, If it's 117 and not 118, even if I go under, they report it
trump, They say, he didn't tell the truth
trump, It was really 119
trump, But like a lot, over 100, where we had the highest stock market in our history
trump, Think of that
trump, That's incredible
trump, But Matt Bevin has made record investments in education spending for Kentucky students
trump, Education is so important to him
trump, Matt Bevin will defend your Kentucky values
trump, He loves his state
trump, From an all out assault being waged on you from the extreme left
trump, Not good
trump, I can't even imagine, how can you vote for somebody from the extreme left This guy, Beshear, is a major lefty
trump, You know that, right Why are we even … Let's just have a good time
trump, Are you sure we need an election tomorrow, Matt I don't know
trump, How does Kentucky vote for a person … I'm telling you, he will always vote for Pelosi and Schumer and shifty Schiff
trump, How about this guy How about Schiff
trump, He makes up a conversation
trump, He gets up before the United States Congress
trump, He repeats my conversation with the head of the Ukraine, the new president, a good guy, repeats it
trump, I said, I never said that
trump, He made a horrible statement
trump, It was a total lie
trump, And then I actually wanted to release the actual conversation
trump, And you haven't heard about the whistleblower after that, have you Because the whistleblower said lots of things that were so good folks, you're going to find out
trump, But these are very dishonest people, shifty Schiff
trump, But Matt's running against these people, and we have to send them a sign because they're dangerous
trump, The radical left named Andy Beshear, who rejects everything Kentucky stands for
trump, That's who they want to win
trump, Beshear has openly pledged to stop the policies of Donald Trump
trump, What are the policies Take care of our vets, take care of our military
trump, We want jobs
trump, We want companies to stop leaving us
trump, They're not leaving anymore
trump, You see, companies aren't leaving anymore
trump, Have you noticed Remember years ago before I ever thought of doing this I mean, when I said let's do this, I said to our great now first lady
trump, I said, Melania, let's give it a shot
trump, And then, one by one, we were doing good
trump, And what we've done, if you remember before we ran, companies were leaving Kentucky, they were leaving, they will go into Mexico
trump, They were going to China, Japan
trump, They were going all over
trump, Any place but Kentucky
trump, You don't read about that at all
trump, Now they're all coming back
trump, They're all coming back
trump, But Beshear wants to shut down your coal, shut down your energy, raise your taxes, and take a giant wrecking ball to the greatest economy in the history of the state of Kentucky
trump, The greatest economy you've ever had, he's going to destroy it
trump, And it won't be long
trump, It'll go very quickly
trump, You know, you're all sitting there
trump, Everybody has good jobs
trump, You don't like it, you go find another job
trump, It's like the choice I got from military
trump, I got you choice too
trump, If you don't like your job, you find another one
trump, You tell the boss, I am getting out of here, I don't like this guy
trump, You go get a better job for more money
trump, Beshear doesn't represent you
trump, He represents the Washington swamp and he's backed by the same people trying to overthrow the last election
trump, Beshear supported crooked Hillary Clinton, and he's funded by the pro-abortion lobby and open borders fanatics
trump, Open borders, let everyone pour right in
trump, Let them all pour right in
trump, Beshear wants to bring sanctuary cities to Kentucky, think of that one
trump, Releasing violent criminals and aliens to terrorize innocent Kentucky families
trump, He wants sanctuary cities
trump, He hasn't learned what's happened
trump, We had a great election a couple of weeks ago in North Carolina
trump, We won two house seats
trump, We were supposed to lose, probably both of them
trump, We won them by a lot
trump, We won them by a lot
trump, And I think we won them because of the Second Amendment, because it's under assault from Democrats
trump, But I think we won also because of sanctuary cities
trump, Because of bad news came out of sanctuary cities, really bad
trump, And I think that was the reason we won both house seats by a lot
trump, Beshear is too liberal, too extreme and too dangerous for the state of Kentucky
trump, Tomorrow, everybody needs to vote, Republican
trump, We got to go Republican all the way
trump, I want to bring up a man, and I'm serious about this
trump, This guy works so hard
trump, He's a great natural talent in business, which you needed
trump, And he straightened it out
trump, And I'll tell you what, he will be one of the truly greats in the history and maybe the greatest in the history of this state
trump, Matt Bevin, come on up Matt
trump, So we're also joined tonight by a very powerful man in Washington, your great Senator Mitch McConnell
trump, Nobody works harder for Kentucky than Mitch
trump, I will tell you, nobody works harder, and frankly, maybe more importantly, nobody works smarter
trump, It's up here
trump, I know a lot of people that work hard
trump, He works smart
trump, When the Democrat arsonists in Washington tried to destroy an innocent man named Brett Kavanaugh, now Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Mitch refused to cave to the left wing mob
trump, And that's what it was, it was a mob
trump, There has never been a man treated so badly in Washington as Judge Kavanaugh, previously Judge, now Justice
trump, We got him in, and he's been great, and he will be great
trump, Mitch confirmed two tremendous Supreme court justices
trump, Mitch helped deliver the largest ever investment in our military and pass VA choice and VA accountability for our amazing veterans
trump, Now, I know Mitch's opponent because they came here
trump, Do you remember last year Slightly different location, and that's okay, it was still the great state of Kentucky
trump, Because Andy Barr had Amy McGrath, an extreme liberal against him
trump, Andy Barr is here with us tonight, and we're going to introduce him, but he beat her
trump, So she said to herself, Well, you know, I failed in Congress, now let's go for the Senate
trump, She wanted to go to the House, now she wants to go
trump, It's not going to work that way
trump, Extreme liberal, anti-gun, lots of different things
trump, Amy McGrath compared my election, think of this one … It's so insulting
trump, I shouldn't say it
trump, Should I say it Yeah, why not
trump, No, it's so insulting
trump, You know, you work so hard, you love your country so much, and they get up to say things
trump, She compared it to 911, a slander upon our nation
trump, She wants open borders
trump, She supports the impeachment hoax witch hunt like nobody
trump, She wants to get rid of it
trump, She wasn't too happy with me last year
trump, We came in, Andy, and we did a job on her, and this is going to be easy
trump, She was caught telling donors, Democrats, that she is further left than anyone in the history of the State of Kentucky
trump, Is that what you want It's not what you want
trump, So next November, the state needs to defend its values and vote for a rock-ribbed Kentucky conservative, Mitch McConnell
trump, But we're going to get back to that later
trump, We'll be back many times
trump, We'll be back here many times
trump, Mitch
trump, Where is he So President Obama left Mitch, and me, and Rand, and all of us, he left 142 openings for judges
trump, You're not supposed to allow any
trump, You don't do that
trump, You know, they say the most important thing a president can do is federal judges, right Including the Supreme Court, obviously
trump, I came in and I said, How many do we have They said, How many what, sir I said, Judge openings
trump, And I thought they'd say none, or one or two
trump, He said, Sir, we have 142
trump, I said, What I said, Tell me again
trump, He said, We have 142
trump, So Mitch and I and Rand would like to thank very much President Obama, because nobody ever been so generous in their life
trump, Also with us tonight is a great warrior and a great guy, smart, strong, loves your state, and he's really become a good friend of mine
trump, And I'll tell you, he's a little bit different
trump, It's okay
trump, But whenever I've needed him, whenever I needed him, he was always there
trump, It's true
trump, I mean, sometimes like I'd say,  I don't need you to vote, Rand
trump, Good
trump, And he'll vote his own way
trump, He's got that little libertarian touch
trump, That's okay
trump, That's okay
trump, But whenever we need, and I'm not talking about me, I'm talking about we, we need a vote, he's so incredible and he's become a really good friend
trump, I want to have him come up for a second
trump, Rand Paul, your Senator, a great warrior
trump, Wow, that was excellent
trump, Whoa
trump, Wow, thank you
trump, Thank you very much, Rand
trump, Great job
trump, He's a warrior
trump, He's a warrior, I've always said it
trump, Also with us tonight are representatives from your state that are fantastic, a couple from outside your state, but we'll welcome them also, right But these are also great fighters, great warriors
trump, Hal Rogers
trump, Thank you, Hal
trump, Brett Guthrie
trump, Thank you, Brett
trump, Thomas Massey
trump, Man we just spoke about won a great grace, Andy Barr
trump, James Comer
trump, James, great
trump, And from an incredible state that we won 2016 that Crooked Hillary said she's going to win that state, didn't come too close at winning that state
trump, It's a great state, and we love the people of North Carolina
trump, Congressman Mark Meadows
trump, Along with some of your local great politicians, and a person that's done a really spectacular job
trump, You know, in Michigan, a woman, she just kept going, she just kept going
trump, Reminded me, by the way, of your governor, from the standpoint she never quit
trump, Now, Republicans hadn't won Michigan in many, many years
trump, She called, Could you come again Could you do it again Could you come make another speech, please I said, All right, this is the last one
trump, No, no, no
trump, How about a couple of more And then Bill Clinton actually told Hillary Clinton, You better get going, something's going on in Michigan
trump, You're going to lose Michigan
trump, You better start going
trump, No, no, no
trump, The polls say everything's good
trump, And we won the great State of Michigan for the first time in many years
trump, And I said, when it came time to picking the Republican Party Chair, head of the RNC, I said, I got to get the woman from Michigan, Ronna McDaniel, to head it up
trump, And when they were saying how sophisticated Hillary Clinton's campaign was … You know, we're not sophisticated, right I don't think so
trump, Remember all during the … Well, she's got the finest computer technology in the world
trump, Yeah, she paid for it, but she didn't get it
trump, She has really fantastic geniuses
trump, But I had somebody that was a lot better than the people that she had
trump, His name was Brad Parscale, and he's here with us
trump, Campaign Manager
trump, Doing a great job
trump, And our numbers are looking very good
trump, But think of it, we're one day short of a year now
trump, Can you believe it Less than a year
trump, It begins November 3rd this time
trump, We had that great, great date, oh boy, November 8th remember Was there ever a day like that in television history And they have no idea, because when we do hang it up, they're all out of business
trump, They know that
trump, That's why I think that we will get … I expect to get a full, hearty, unbelievable endorsement very soon from the failing New York Times, and from the Amazon Washington Post
trump, You know, before the election started, about a month before I announced that I was going to do this, I said, I'm going to become a politician
trump, I can't believe it
trump, I'm going to become a politician
trump, But I looked at the New York Times, and it was like a little leaflet that you hand out at a grocery store, right The wind would blow it away
trump, It was dead
trump, I call it the failing New York Times only because eventually it will fail
trump, But we built it up
trump, They do stories … In my entire life, I had a few stories on the front page of the New York Times, and now if I have three or four a day, it's like, Why are they not covering me anymore And they're all bad
trump, They can take what we did two weeks ago with the number one terrorist in the world, and they make it look as bad as possible
trump, In fact, I love dogs, but they gave the dog full credit
trump, They didn't give me any credit
trump, That's okay
trump, The dog got the credit, and the dog will be coming very shortly, by the way, to the White House
trump, But they'll be endorsing us
trump, And you know, all of these crazy, like CNN with its bad ratings, there goes its red light, it just went off
trump, Their red light just went off
trump, See how it is Well, it's hard
trump, Look, put yourself in their position
trump, They have it on, their covering, and now they know they're ready to get hit, so they turn it off
trump, I mean, I can't blame them
trump, Their red light just went off
trump, No, but put yourself in CNN's position
trump, Without us … You know, cable was not supposed to be a good business, then we came along
trump, It's not me, it's we
trump, They came from the valleys, they came from everywhere, the cities, they came from places, they're still trying to figure out, Where the hell did all those people come from It's true
trump, A great Senator from Tennessee, they have early voting, and I was in Pennsylvania making a speech, and he saw me because he had a couple of great Congressman friends from Pennsylvania, and he said, You know, in Tennessee we have very early voting, and I just left, and I've been doing this for 24 years
trump, And I got to be honest with you, I've never seen so many people vote
trump, And these are people, they love our country, they're incredible, they work hard, but they never liked what they were voting for, so they really wouldn't vote
trump, Sounds terrible
trump, But they didn't like anything that they saw
trump, They say, Sir, I'm seeing people, and he said this, come out from the valleys, come out from the mountains, come out from areas that they've never come out
trump, We have lines that are five blocks long at every voting booth and parlor
trump, He said, I can't speak for the rest of the country, but if the rest of the countries like Tennessee, you're going to have the greatest victory in the history of our nation
trump, And that's what happened
trump, That was a great statement
trump, That was a great statement from people from a great state, also
trump, Tomorrow you must elect the entire Republican ticket, from governor on down, including your next Lieutenant Governor, Ralph Alvarado
trump, Ralph Alvarado
trump, Great, Ralph
trump, You're a good man
trump, And your next Attorney General, Daniel Cameron
trump, Should I bring Daniel up Get up here, Daniel, come on
trump, Here's a star
trump, Here's a star
trump, Mr
trump, President, I hope you can tell that Kentucky is Trump country
trump, We are proud to stand with you on pro-life issues, and here in the Commonwealth, we are going to stand up for those who cannot speak for themselves
trump, And Mr
trump, President, we are going to stand with you in protecting the Second Amendment rights of all Kentuckians
trump, And Mr
trump, President, I make a personal commitment to you as the next Attorney General, we are going to make sure that Kentucky is never a sanctuary state
trump, Good

trump, Thanks, Michael
trump, Auditor, Mark Harmon
trump, Thank you, Mark
trump, Treasurer, Allison Ball
trump, She's doing great
trump, And Agriculture Commissioner, Ryan Quarles
trump, With the help of everyone here, America is the hottest economy anywhere in the world, by far
trump, Foreign leaders come in to see me, Congratulations on your economy
trump, China's doing poorly, as you know, but they're paying us billions, and billions, and billions of dollars, and they've never given us 25 cents before
trump, Billions of dollars
trump, They gave a lot of that money to our farmers, who got targeted, but no longer
trump, They're back buying from our farmers
trump, But we've created 6
trump,7 million new jobs since the election
trump, And if I would have ever said that during the campaign, the fake news back there would have never let me hear the end of it
trump, Think of that, 6
trump,7
trump, And today, just today, a record, 158 million Americans are now employed, the highest level of employment in our country's history
trump, African American unemployment just dropped to the lowest level ever recorded in the history of our country
trump, Hispanic American and Asian American unemployment rates have also reached the all time historic lows
trump, The history of our country
trump, Hourly earnings, listen to this, are up 9 since the election
trump, Nobody ever thought that was going to be happening
trump, Under the previous two administrations, we lost 60,000 factories
trump, I thought that was a typo
trump, I said, How the hell can you lose 60,000 It turned out to be right
trump, And you know how I know Because I've been saying it for two years, and they never corrected me
trump, It's true, two years
trump, I get a call sometimes from the people in the campaign, Sir Sir, we have an emergency
trump, What's the emergency Somebody's calling from the media, the fake news
trump, Did you put a comma in the wrong location, sir Because they consider it to be a front page story
trump, Okay
trump, Under my administration, we've added nearly 10,000 new factories and many, many more thousands of factories are coming into our country
trump, We reversed it
trump, To get relief to working families, we passed massive tax cuts, massive
trump, To lift up distressed communities, our tax law created opportunity zones
trump, Tim Scott of South Carolina was so involved, including 144 designated by your great governor
trump, By the way, the other governor
trump, I don't think … Well, I don't know
trump, You know He's not going to do so well
trump, He'll be calling for a meeting, and I won't be able to see him because I don't like him very much
trump, But I like this one very much, and we're going to help him
trump, We slashed a record number of job-killing regulations
trump, We ended the war on American energy
trump, We're now the largest producer of energy anywhere in the world
trump, And we ended the war on beautiful clean coal
trump, I announced the withdrawal of the United States from the horrible, costly, one-sided Paris Climate Accord
trump, Ask them how they're doing in Paris with it
trump, Not too good
trump, I canceled the so called Clean Power Plan, and repealed Obama's federal coal moratorium
trump, We're putting our great miners back to work
trump, On trade, we're starting to set records every week, we're reversing decades of Washington disloyalty, stupidity, and corruption
trump, Past administrations did nothing as China looted our factories, and stole up to 500 billion of American dollars
trump, By the way, people can't even believe it
trump, Not 500 million
trump, That's a lot
trump, If you lost 500 million, that's a lot
trump, I thought that was another typo
trump, 500 billion they would take a year from us
trump, We rebuilt China
trump, And I give them a lot of credit, by the way, I give China
trump, What I don't give credit to is Obama and past administrations beyond Obama, I don't give them credit because they let it happen
trump, They should have never let it happen
trump, But now we're taking in tens of billions, and billions, and billions of dollars
trump, Just recently, very slow, Slippy Joe … Biden that is, said of China's piracy and plunder, They're not that bad, folks
trump, He always used the word folks
trump, I watched him today, he used the word folks
trump, Hi folks
trump, Hi
trump, Hi, My time is up
trump, I got to leave
trump, No, they have him all freaked out because he makes a mistake every time he speaks
trump, So I can just see these handlers, because they're handlers, like they use on horses, they're handlers, right All right, get him off now
trump, He's been up there long enough
trump, So they're screaming, Get off, get off Sleepy Joe, get off the stage, please
trump, Please Joe, you're doing fine
trump, Joe, you're doing fine
trump, You're doing fine
trump, And then he goes, I love being in Ohio, but he was in Iowa yesterday
trump, Yes sir
trump, And they say, Dammit, he should have left sooner, we told him
trump, Get off the stage, Sleepy Joe
trump, Sleepy Joe, get off the damn stage
trump, But he said about, Sleepy Joe, about China, They're not that bad, folks
trump, They're not really competition for us
trump, No, they're not
trump, 500 billion a year, right He did nothing in eight years, him and Obama
trump, In fact, I'm here because of them, when you think about it
trump, Right Just thinking
trump, I'm here because of them
trump, Kellyanne Conway, stand up, Kellyanne
trump, Stand up
trump, Another warrior
trump, I just saw Kellyanne
trump, I said stand up
trump, No, but think of it, as somebody saying that
trump, Now look, 1
trump,5 billion that Hunter, who got thrown out of the Navy, who had no experience, who had not anything, got a lot of money from Ukraine, but he got 1
trump,5 billion from China, I got to tell you, I've been negotiating with China, they're very tough
trump, China
trump, I got to tell you, I've been negotiating with China
trump, They're very tough
trump, That is not the same group of Chinese people that I've been negotiating with
trump, They gave him 1
trump,5 billion
trump, He'll make millions and millions with that
trump, And how about saying, by the way, Mr
trump, President, would you please take over the negotiations that President Trump is no longer handling Guess what You would be sold down the tubes so fast, and we're so close
trump, China wants to make a deal so badly
trump, I think they'd love to see another president
trump, They would like to see another president more than crooked Hillary would, okay
trump, Can you imagine if they ever took over negotiations of this deal, which is going to be one of the greatest deals ever made
trump, Has to be, because we started down here and they were up there
trump, Has to be
trump, Can you imagine if they ever took over negotiations This is what China would love more than anything else
trump, It's not going to happen folks, because we can't let our country go back to hell
trump, We can't do it
trump, We can't let it happen
trump, Because the Bidens got rich while America was robbed, and let me tell you the fake news will not put it in
trump, I watched the last debate, and this weakling named Anderson Cooper saying, well, it's totally unsubstantiated, Mr
trump, Biden, solely answer
trump, What's unsubstantiated He is on tape doing a real quid pro quo
trump, Sure, it's totally unsubstantiated, sir
trump, I've never seen anything like it
trump, Could you imagine if I did what he did Could you imagine if Don Jr
trump, or Eric Trump walked out of China while I was, let's say, vice president or president
trump, Let's say they walked out of China with 1
trump,5 billion
trump, Do you think the press would be saying, well, it's unsubstantiated No, it's something
trump, Let me just tell you something
trump, These people, not all of them, but these people are very dishonest people
trump, Very, very dishonest
trump, But under this administration, the great betrayal is over
trump, America is not for sale
trump, And we're more determined than ever to drain the swamp, and that's what we're doing with these crazy people
trump, A lot of bad things happened, and a lot of bad things I think are going to be revealed because there's no way we can allow them to get away with what they would have with a normal person gotten away with
trump, Let's face it
trump, These are bad people
trump, Thanks to my tariffs, we will soon have over 100 billion from a country that didn't want to do anything with us
trump, And I'll tell you, they started buying our farm product
trump, You see that
trump, They started buying a lot of our product even before the deals are done
trump, Last year, I got our farmers 16 billion because they were targeted
trump, And the year before I got them 12 billion
trump, I just took them out of the tariffs, and we had a lot leftover
trump, And I said, congratulations farmers
trump, I love you
trump, I love our farmers
trump, They love me
trump, That's why they did, they targeted our farmers
trump, I said, congratulations
trump, That's compliments of China
trump, And they do
trump, They want to make a deal so badly
trump, Frankly, honestly, they want to make a deal a lot more than I want to make a deal
trump, That's the way it is
trump, Because we're doing very well right now with China
trump, We're replacing the NAFTA disaster with the US, Mexico, Canada agreement
trump, A huge win for Kentucky farmers, for Kentucky auto workers, for Kentucky manufacturers
trump, Unfortunately, Nancy Pelosi so far and the do nothing Democrats don't want to give the people of our country a victory
trump, It's really, let it be a bipartisan deal
trump, I don't care
trump, It's such an incredible deal for this country, and NAFTA was one of the worst deals ever made
trump, Democrats need to pass the US MCA
trump, We need their votes
trump, Otherwise you can't pass it
trump, And it's up to Pelosi who has to put it forward, but she's too busy wasting their time
trump, So either pass it or go back to San Francisco and clean up your mess
trump, The Obama Biden's administration's trans-Pacific partnership would have dealt the death blow to the American auto industry
trump, That would have been one of the great catastrophes
trump, My first week in office, I canceled that job-killing travesty
trump, You know all about it
trump, Under our policies just days ago, Ford and the UAW announced a 1 billion investment in Louisville
trump, 1 billion
trump, Before my election, our leaders used the great American middle-class as a piggy bank to fund their delusional global projects
trump, They were globalists
trump, I was elected to be president of the United States, not president of the globe
trump, They decimated American manufacturing to promote economic growth in foreign countries
trump, Tell me, how is that good
trump, They try and convince you it's good
trump, I was a very good student
trump, I'm a very like, we're all smart
trump, We sit back, we listen, and I say, these people are, something wrong with them
trump, Only in Kentucky can somebody be so precise
trump, You're right about, you are right about that
trump, They deployed our military to protect immensely wealthy nations, subsidizing their welfare states with your money
trump, The money we spend on other country's militaries, but it's coming down
trump, And I'm telling other countries, I'm sorry, you're going to have to pay now
trump, I'm sorry
trump, Pay
trump, Pay
trump, Pay, you got to pay
trump, And they poured precious American blood and treasure into the Middle East while our great cities fell into decay and disrepair
trump, We go in for internet
trump, We want rural, we'll bring it in
trump, And we're bringing 5g into places like Kentucky that haven't been properly served
trump, We're bringing it in all over the middle West, all over the country
trump, And we're really ahead of schedule
trump, We're doing really well
trump, People will be very surprised soon when some numbers come out, but we're doing very well
trump, But you were very much underserved for years
trump, And yet we're investing billions and billions of dollars in places you've never even heard of
trump, Doesn't make sense, does it But after years of rebuilding other nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation
trump, We are finally putting America first
trump, Yet the deep state and the failed ruling class are trying to resist any changes to their failed policies of the past
trump, They believe it is their right to rule over you and to redistribute your wealth all around the world
trump, No thank you
trump, No thank you
trump, That's why we ended the Paris Accord
trump, That's why… We've ended a lot
trump, I don't even want to tell you
trump, But the sellout of the American nation ended the day I took the oath of office and you understand that
trump, Past leaders transform far away nations into chaotic war zones
trump, Then they demanded that America accept unlimited migration from those terror afflicted regions
trump, Take the people, take the people
trump, We defeated ISIS
trump, We
trump, When I took over three years ago, when we took over, when I took over, ISIS was all over
trump, I defeated ISIS
trump, I didn't even know to what extent
trump, I was watching the other night the great Lou Dobbs, and he said, When Trump took over, President Trump, he used to say, Trump is a great president
trump, Then he said, Trump is the greatest president since Ronald Reagan
trump, Then he said, No, no, Trump is an even better president than Ronald Reagan
trump, And now he's got me down as the greatest president in the history of our country, including George Washington and Abraham Lincoln
trump, Thank you
trump, We love you too
trump, But we didn't fight them over there only to invite them over here
trump, We didn't do that
trump, We're not doing that
trump, You see what we're going and you see what we're doing and you see it's never easy because I get hit by the swamp 15 different ways, but it doesn't matter
trump, We're doing the right thing to protect our communities
trump, My administration implemented the travel ban on some of the world's most dangerous countries
trump, A lot of people were against it
trump, They said, Isn't that terrible Countries that have crime rates that are so high you wouldn't even believe it's possible, and we have a travel ban now
trump, We don't take people from those countries
trump, I'm sorry
trump, And we won a historic victory on the travel ban in the United States Supreme Court, ruled it totally constitutional
trump, On no issue have Democrats more totally betrayed you than on immigration
trump, Democrats want open borders
trump, They want to give illegal aliens free healthcare, free education, more advantages than our own citizens have and more benefits than our own military gets
trump, In the Republican party, we believe taking care of our own citizens first is paramount
trump, Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure our Southern border, illegal crossings have dropped 60 since May
trump, The wall is being built
trump, It's going up rapidly
trump, It's got a big impact
trump, And I want to thank Mexico
trump, We have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our border policing our border because the Democrats will not do anything to end loopholes
trump, It would take us 15 minutes and we could end the loopholes
trump, Think of the word loopholes
trump, They don't want to end the loophole
trump, If you want to keep violent criminal aliens out of your communities, you have only one choice tomorrow, and that's to vote for Matt Bevin
trump, Democrats are becoming more extreme and militant by the day
trump, The Democrat's planned government takeover of healthcare would obliterate Medicare
trump, What are they doing I will always protect Medicare for our nation's seniors
trump, It's going to be protected
trump, What they're doing is crazy
trump, And we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions
trump, And we will also protect you with preexisting physicians
trump, How about that Preexisting physicians
trump, First time I've ever said that, just thought of that
trump, True
trump, Because under their plan, you don't get your own doctor
trump, You know what you get Whatever the hell you get
trump, That's what you get
trump, Oh great doc, fix me up doc
trump, You mean you want to work on my heart Who are you, doc I don't think so
trump, Thanks to our campaign to combat the opioid epidemic with your governor's help, we have seen a 17 drop in overdose deaths in Kentucky, which is a record
trump, Democrats have also waged an unrelenting assault against people of faith
trump, Anybody in here a person of faith Great people
trump, The last administration threatened adoption and foster care agencies purely for their religious beliefs
trump, Last week my administration took action to stop that Obama era assault
trump, It was an assault
trump, And governor Matt Bevin is a national leader on behalf of vulnerable children, and there is no better leader than him, what he has done
trump, And together we're fighting for American orphans, foster families, and the sacred rights of religious believers
trump, And he's done a fantastic job
trump, Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion, ripping babies straight from their mother's womb right up until the moment of birth
trump, And that's why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God
trump, Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption
trump, The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and it's the party of the great Abraham Lincoln
trump, We forgot that
trump, Abraham Lincoln
trump, The incredible rebuilding of our military includes over 100 billion investments all across the state of Kentucky
trump, I withdrew our nation from the horrible one sided Iran nuclear deal
trump, It's not the same country
trump, When I came in that country, there were in 18 different sites of confliction, they called it
trump, And now they're a little different, a little different
trump, We'll see what happens with Iran
trump, And I recognize Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem
trump, For years, you watched as your politicians apologized for America
trump, Remember He'd go around, oh, thank you so much
trump, He wouldn't apologize to you, but he apologized to others
trump, Now you have a president who is standing up for America, and we are standing up for the people of Kentucky
trump, The next step to victory begins tomorrow and it begins with all of you
trump, You have to do this
trump, Look, maybe you'll be late for work
trump, Maybe you'll be late for whatever
trump, I don't want to know everything
trump, Some things I don't want to know, but you have to just put it off
trump, You have to go vote
trump, It's so important
trump, Tomorrow is so, because beyond even the governorship, and it's so important
trump, Because again, your state is setting records
trump, In the history of your state, you've never done this well economically, job wise, unemployment, employment, factories moving in, new factories, open expansion of your car plants
trump, You've never done this well, but you're sending that big message to the rest of the country
trump, It's so important
trump, You got to get your friends, you got to vote
trump, Because if you lose, it sends a really bad message
trump, It just sends a bad, and they will build it up
trump, Here's the story
trump, If you win, they're going to make it like ho hum
trump, And if you lose, they're going to say, Trump suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the world
trump, This was the greatest
trump, You can't let that happen to me
trump, And you know what You can't let that happen to your incredible state, Kentucky
trump, You can't let that happen
trump, That would be a disaster for yourself because you'd be losing an incredible governor
trump, But you're going to have a great victory tomorrow
trump, With your support, you have to go out and vote
trump, We will show the corrupt Democrats that the American people are not backing down and we will never ever back down
trump, So tomorrow, we need you to go out and get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors
trump, Get out and vote for governor Matt Bevin and all of these great Republicans
trump, With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity
trump, Together we will elect a Republican Congress
trump, 2020, we're going to re-elect because of their stupidity
trump, These people are on the run, and I will campaign in every one of those states that were so corrupt if they raise their hand
trump, And don't forget
trump, Out of 194, we got 194, not one Republican left us last week
trump, And two Republicans, think of that
trump, And the other three couldn't get there because of, but they were votes
trump, They said they were totally votes, had airport problems
trump, I said, you can't do that
trump, Airport problems
trump, But then we had the Democrats
trump, We picked up two Democrats, so we had bipartisan support
trump, That's unusual
trump, I always say because they're lousy politicians, they've got lousy policy, but they do stick together
trump, That's about it
trump, We will elect a Republican Congress in 2020
trump, And we'll have a great speaker of the house in Kevin
trump, We're going to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration
trump, We'll enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with those beautiful words made in the USA
trump, We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending, listen to this, the AIDS epidemic in America within less than 10 years
trump, We've already started
trump, Who would have felt we could have done that We've started
trump, In the past administration toward the end, we had certain things that we could have done
trump, They didn't do anything
trump, They didn't do anything, but we did
trump, We have it all funded and we started, think of that, AIDS within 10 years will be out of this country
trump, Nobody would have thought that was possible
trump, We will end it
trump, Great, great
trump, I came into my office, they were telling me about the breakthroughs that have been made
trump, It's incredible what they're doing
trump, And don't forget right to try, by the way, where somebody who's terminally ill can now use our medicines, which they were never allowed to in the past
trump, So instead of traveling to Asia and Europe and all over the world, or going home hopeless and dying, they can now use what we call right to try
trump, We have the greatest doctors, the greatest drugs, greatest labs in the world
trump, They can now go and try
trump, And we are having unbelievable success
trump, Unbelievable
trump, Right to try
trump, We will chart a new era of discovery in space, and someday soon we will land on, believe it or not, the surface of the moon only to go to Mars
trump, You know I said we've done the moon
trump, No, they say, sir, we land on the moon to go to Mars, and that's what we're doing with the moon
trump, And we are really, really advanced
trump, It's moving along rapidly
trump, We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms
trump, And above all, we will never stop fighting for the cherished values that bind us together as one America
trump, We support, protect and defend the constitution of the United States
trump, We stand with the incredible heroes and warriors of law enforcement
trump, We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life
trump, We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way
trump, We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag
trump, Loyal citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country
trump, We are returning power to you, the American people
trump, The great state of Kentucky was settled by some of the most devoted and courageous people ever to walk on the face of the earth
trump, These tough pioneer men and strong pioneer women braved the wilderness and defied the danger to build a life and to build a home
trump, They didn't have a lot of money
trump, They didn't have a lot of luxury
trump, But they all had one thing in common
trump, They love their families, they love their country and they love their God
trump, These proud Kentucky Patriots did not shed their blood, sweat and tears so that we could sit at home while others try to erase their legacy and destroy their magnificent heritage
trump, Our allegiance is to our nation
trump, Our loyalty is to our citizens
trump, And our devotion is to our Creator
trump, For the sake of our freedom, for the sake of our children, we are going to keep on working
trump, We are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning
trump, We are one movement
trump, We are one people
trump, We are one family and one glorious nation under God
trump, America is thriving like never before
trump, And ladies and gentlemen of Kentucky, the best is yet to come
trump, Together, we will make America wealthy again
trump, We will make America strong again
trump, We will make America proud again
trump, We will make America safe again
trump, And we will make America great again
trump, Thank you, Kentucky
trump, Thank you
trump, Go out and vote
trump,
trump,Well thank you very much
trump, And I'm thrilled to be back in Wisconsin where we had a very big night a few years ago
trump, You remember that very big night Remember that They said, Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin
trump, And since then we've produced everything we said and more and more
trump, Before it was talk
trump, I said, I'm going to do this
trump, We're going to take care of your trade
trump, What we've done with China now, on Wednesday we signed, that's tomorrow
trump, What we've done with the US MCA, what we've done with Japan, 40 billion trade deal that a lot of it has to do with the farmers
trump, South Korea
trump, Oh, you got to love Trump, you got to love Trump
trump, And you're great Green Bay Packers are playing San Francisco this weekend
trump, Good luck
trump, So do we have any Green Bay packer fans here tonight That's right
trump, And you have a great quarterback who's a good guy, a good guy
trump, As we begin the year, our economy is booming, wages are rising, poverty is plummeting
trump, Crime is falling and America is the envy of the entire world
trump, And then our opponents say, We're not going to win
trump, Let's impeach President Trump
trump, Let's impeach him
trump, We've got the greatest economy in our history
trump, Our military has been totally rebuilt
trump, Let's impeach him
trump, But we've created 7 million jobs since the election, including more than 1 million manufacturing and construction jobs
trump, Nobody thought that was possible
trump, And we will soon be replacing the NAFTA catastrophe, one of the worst trade deals in the history of the world, frankly with the incredible US MCA, Canada, Mexico, a giant victory for Wisconsin workers, farmers and dairy producers, a tremendous victory
trump, And we may get that all taken care of this week or next week
trump, It just needs one more vote and we'll get that out of the Republican Senate
trump, The Republican Senate will be great
trump, Tomorrow we'll also be signing our phase one trade deal with China, massively boosting exports of products made and produced right here in the great state of Wisconsin
trump, So after years of devastating defense cuts, we have fully rebuilt the United States Military to a point that it has never been before and it's now more advanced, more lethal, and more powerful than ever
trump, And last year, our great American warriors, because that's what they are
trump, And they love it
trump, I got to tell you, they love it, right They love doing that
trump, They wouldn't trade places with me under any circumstances
trump, They wouldn't trade places with all of our great Wisconsin politicians
trump, They want to be a military warrior and we don't want them for that
trump, We want them doing what they're doing
trump, But our great warriors carried out a daring nighttime raid and terminated the founder and leader of ISIS
trump, The animal known as al-Baghdadi is dead and the wicked caliphate is 100 destroyed
trump, And I will tell you when we took over a little less than three years ago, ISIS was all over the place
trump, Now the caliphate is 100 destroyed
trump, Do you remember when I wanted to leave when it was at 98 I said, let some of the other countries finish it off
trump, We're going home, right They all said, Oh, no sir, please finish it
trump, So we finished it off to 100
trump, A few days ago
trump, We took bold and decisive action to defend American lives and deliver American justice
trump, At my direction, the United States military launched a flawless precision strike that killed the world's number one terrorist, number one terrorist
trump, Do you know who that is Qasem Soleimani, number one terrorist in the world
trump, Soleimani was responsible for murdering and wounding thousands of Americans and was actively planning new attacks, but we stopped them cold
trump, And frankly, they already started the attack, as you saw in Baghdad, on our very large embassy in Baghdad
trump, That was already started
trump, And I said to our generals, Get there now
trump, We don't want to have another Benghazi
trump, Not on my watch, or on any watch
trump, They said, Sir, we'll be there tomorrow
trump, I said, Nope, you got to be there right now
trump, Get them over there now
trump, There are thousands of soldiers
trump, They were soldiers
trump, You take a look at that crowd
trump, That was not protesters
trump, They were soldiers, and they were surrounding our embassy in Baghdad
trump, And all of a sudden they see these beautiful, very expensive, I will tell you, brand new Apache helicopters roaming over the top
trump, And then they see our great military
trump, You saw them in the plane, right Some of them were getting out of their pajamas
trump, They were
trump, I said, Don't worry about it
trump, I said, We won't put that on
trump, But they were sitting there and they were calling a roll call in the plane
trump, Right And it was a beautiful sight
trump, And these guys were better than Tom Cruise at his best
trump,  Protestors Disturb the Rally
trump, One protester, a very weak voice
trump, If you people wouldn't go crazy every time you see something, he'd go right through and nobody would even know she was there
trump, Now she's going home to mom where she will be in big trouble
trump, Because I guarantee you that mom voted for Trump
trump, And in 10 years from now, when I run yet again, she'll be voting for Trump too
trump, I'm only kidding
trump, I'm only kidding
trump, We drive them crazy
trump, We drive them crazy
trump, They say, You know he's not leaving, don't you He's never leaving
trump, They say, He's going to win
trump, He's never going to leave
trump, These people, it's called Trump Derangement Syndrome
trump, It really is
trump, You know what they don't know is that if for any reason, after five years we do leave, which we will, because I believe in that stuff
trump, Right But you know what's going to happen to their industry
trump, They're all going to die and fold up
trump, Going to be very boring out there, very boring
trump, That's why I say at some point, every single one of them will be endorsing Donald Trump
trump, But crazy Bernie Sanders and the Washington Democrats, by the way, Bernie is surging
trump, Bernie is surging
trump, Bernie
trump, But the Democrats are outraged that we kill this terrorist monster even though this monster was behind hundreds and hundreds of death
trump, That's two
trump, Hey, speaking of protesters, have you seen what's happened in Iran The protesters are on our side
trump, First time ever
trump, They're on our side
trump, In fact, they put this big American flag on the street
trump, And the Iranians, thousands and thousands of Iranians were supposed to walk on it and trample it and step and beat the hell out of it
trump, Every one of them went around that flag
trump, They like Trump
trump, They like you
trump, I'm just your representative, but they like us
trump, They like us
trump, They haven't seen anything like that in a long time
trump, They went around, did you see it They went around the flag
trump, They didn't want to touch it
trump, They love America
trump, They love our country
trump, That's called progress
trump, That's called progress
trump, But the Democrats are doing everything possible to disparage what we did with the hit on this monster
trump, Many of the young men and women you see walking around without arms, without legs and without … were done by Soleimani
trump, That's what he loved
trump, He loved the roadside bomb
trump, That's what he loved
trump, Thousands and thousands and thousands in Iraq, in Afghanistan, roadside bombs
trump, He was the king of the roadside bombs
trump, Great percentages of people don't have legs right now and arms because of this son of a bitch
trump, Now the Democrats should be outraged by Soleimani's evil crimes, not that decision to end his wretched life
trump, They're saying, Well, he was a general
trump, He was this
trump, He was that
trump, You know what Number one, he wasn't supposed to be there
trump, He was a designated terrorist by president Obama who didn't do anything about it as usual
trump, As usual, they don't do anything
trump, They designate and they don't do anything about
trump, He should've been killed 20 years ago
trump, Now, here's the story with the Democrats
trump, If I didn't kill him, and let's say we lost three, four, five embassies or bases or thousands of people or hundreds of people or two people were killed, they would have said, Trump should have taken him out
trump, Anything we do, they go the opposite
trump, So we kill him
trump, And that was precision
trump, Some people thought it went much too fast
trump, Went too fast
trump, So we kill him and they say, What a horrible … If we didn't kill him, they'd say, What a horrible thing
trump, Right And by the way, they think they caught me
trump, They never catch us
trump, Because Mexico's paying for the wall
trump, You know that
trump, You'll see that
trump, It's all worked out
trump, Mexico's paying
trump, It's driving them crazy
trump, Now they say, Okay, he's building the wall
trump, But Mexico didn't pay
trump, Mexico will pay
trump, And here's the thing
trump, You'll see that it'll come out
trump, We'll do it sometime during the debate or maybe before
trump, Our debate, the real debate that people are going to watch, because nobody's watching
trump, haven't been doing great on the debates
trump, I have to tell you
trump, But we are building this wall
trump, We're over 100 miles right now
trump, We're going to be expanding the length
trump, You have a lot of natural where you have 1,978 miles
trump, You need 500 miles, but 700 would be good, 750 or so would be great
trump, We're going to now get it up
trump, We have all the financing
trump, You think it's easy getting financing when people put … I can get anything from them
trump, I can get whatever I want in terms of money except for a wall
trump, And I made one big mistake
trump, I should have said to them, We will not build the wall
trump, We don't want the wall
trump, They would have insisted that we build it
trump, We would have had all the money we wanted
trump, I made a mistake
trump, I made a big mistake
trump, Now we're building the wall
trump, It's going up and it's going up rapidly and very soon we'll be building about a mile a day
trump, And we should be up to over 400 miles by next year, the end of next year, and shortly thereafter it'll be finished
trump, And it's already having a tremendous impact on people not being able to come into our country
trump, Bernie and the radical left cannot protect your family and they cannot protect our country, nor do they want to, I think
trump, According to Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren, who has somewhat less Indian blood in her than I do, and I have none
trump, Remember Oh, we hit her hard
trump, But I hit her too early, but now it doesn't matter
trump, She's not going anywhere
trump, But Bernie said, according to her, Bernie said, and I don't believe that he said this, because I don't know him
trump, I don't particularly like him
trump, He's a nasty guy
trump, But I don't believe he said it
trump, It's not his field
trump, You have to know what people say
trump, She said, right, that Bernie stated strongly that a woman can't win for president
trump, A woman can win for president
trump, Fortunately that could happen
trump, Who knows But she said that Bernie said, A woman can't win
trump, I don't believe that Bernie said that
trump, I really don't know
trump, Just it's not the kind of a thing he'd say
trump, If you want to keep America safe, just vote Republican
trump, We're doing so well
trump, We're doing so well
trump, Now this was … leave him alone
trump, That's all right
trump, Let security just take care of her
trump, Okay, you all right Get him out here
trump, Good
trump, Good job security
trump, Good job
trump, Do we love law enforcement And is there ever, ever a better place to be than a Trump rally on some night during some week The truth, is we have a great time
trump, But you know what More importantly we get things done
trump, We're getting everything done
trump, But even president Obama's own former National Security Advisor, a highly respected general named Jim Jones, praised our action to take out Soleimani and said it was absolutely correct and it was the absolute right thing to do
trump, I'm sure they like him very much
trump, He sounds like our kind of a guy
trump, So Jim, if they've given you a hard time, come on over to the Republican party
trump, No, he's a respected guy
trump, He said we did the right thing
trump, Everyone knows
trump, They're saying, Was the attack eminent Was it eminent Does the fact that he's killed hundreds of thousands of people and thousands of Americans and horribly killed and wounded thousands and thousands That doesn't matter
trump, Was the attack eminent I think they're going to start a new investigation
trump, Was the attack or this horror … and by the way, he was in a country he wasn't allowed to be in
trump, We don't mention that because he was designated and he wasn't allowed to be there
trump, And he was there with the head of Hezbollah, and they were talking about, like Hillary Clinton
trump, They were talking about weddings and working out
trump, Soleimani and the head of Hezbollah, they were talking about weddings, working out
trump, Or Bill Clinton in the back of the airplane with the Attorney General, where they may have made her an offer that you're going to go to the Supreme Court
trump, Or they may have said, You're going to to stay Attorney General, but help
trump, Help
trump, They may have said that
trump, Do you think they would have said that No
trump, Nothing like that
trump, But do you remember They talked about golf and grandchildren, right 45 minutes
trump, I like golf
trump, 45 minutes
trump, I like golf and I love my grandchildren
trump, I don't think I can talk to somebody about them for 45 minutes that I don't even know
trump, 45
trump, I have a beautiful grandchild
trump, He's really beautiful
trump, He's so great
trump, Okay
trump, What else am I going to say, right Then I took a… Let's talk one or two
trump, How's Tiger doing How's this one How's that one That's another five minutes, right What am I going to do with the other 35 minutes Maybe I'm going to talk about Supreme court appointments, et cetera
trump, Got zero
trump, He got zero out of it
trump, He got zero
trump, I'd love to have that money back
trump, It's a lot of money
trump, But I've warned the Ayatollah and the government of Iran that they must not harm, hurt, or kill any protesters
trump, The whole world is watching
trump, It's watching
trump, They've killed thousands of protests
trump, We support the Iranian people and their courageous struggle for freedom
trump, It's incredible what's going on over there
trump, It really is
trump, But we're watching it
trump, We're watching very closely
trump, And we were ready
trump, That night when the attack was made on us, attack was made on us
trump, Remember this, they killed an American, they killed other people just before that
trump, And so we did what we did, right And they said, it's our turn now
trump, I said, you better be careful when you say it's our turn
trump, Because we had designated targets that you wouldn't know… It would have taken him 30 years to rebuild if that was even possible
trump, It's true, it's true
trump, And we saw those missiles launched, and they were big and they were fast, and they were accurate
trump, Four of them went bad
trump, They fell way short
trump, But 12 of them hit
trump, And I said, man, they are quick
trump, They knew immediately what they were, and they saw those missiles hit
trump, I said, how bad is it It hit a base
trump, And an hour later or so, we get a call back
trump, I said, how many killed Nobody, sir
trump, I said, how many hurt They said, nobody, sir
trump, And I said, they just saved themselves a trillion dollars and a lot of lives
trump, That's true
trump, A trillion, not a billion
trump, A trillion
trump, So they did a very smart thing and we're not looking for regime change
trump, They've tried that with Libya
trump, They go, Hillary Clinton, let's get rid of Libya
trump, Let's get rid of Gaddafi
trump, Let's get rid of Gaddafi
trump, How's that working out Right Let's get rid of Gaddafi
trump, That was a Hillary deal
trump, Then you had Benghazi
trump, And see Benghazi, they didn't respond
trump, They didn't respond
trump, Should be
trump, Should be to Iraq
trump, Iraq didn't knock down the World Trade Center just in case anybody had any question
trump, And this guy did kill
trump, He was not a sweetheart
trump, He was a bad guy in every way
trump, But he did kill terrorists, right And it became Harvard University for terrorists, right But they did go after him, but he didn't knock down out
trump, You know what I did with the soldiers They don't tell you the truth, sorry, because there are a bunch of corrupt people back there
trump, I told Turkey, you got to defend your own border
trump, We're not going to defend your border
trump, And we get along with Turkey
trump, We get along, but they've been there for… And by the way, I call it a safe zone
trump, That is the most dangerous safe zone in the world
trump, Okay I'm looking at the audience, there's about three of you that want to be in that zone, okay And you're very tough people
trump, But this is the most dangerous… I call it, I call it the safe zone
trump, Some day it may be a safe zone, but I took our soldiers out, because we had an army here and we had a vast number of people here, and they were going to fight
trump, I said, if they're going to fight like they have been for hundreds and hundreds of years, for centuries, let them fight
trump, But we're getting the hell out of there, okay But the fake news doesn't tell you the right story
trump, But the fake news doesn't tell you the right story
trump, Because what I did is I took our soldiers, and you know what I did I moved them to the oil area, and we now control the oil
trump, So they said Trump stayed in Syria
trump, Trump said, so people said to me, why you staying in Syria Okay A long time ago
trump, You have no idea the things and the decisions I've seen
trump, So they say Trump's in Syria, I didn't pull out
trump, I did pull out
trump, We have the oil really secure
trump, We'll see what happens with it, but we can help our friends, the Kurds, because that's where they got their wealth
trump, And then ultimately it was with ISIS
trump, But right now it's with the United States military
trump, And we also got rid of remnants of ISIS
trump, While we're creating jobs and killing terrorists, democrats in Congress are wasting America's time with demented hoaxes and crazy witch hunts that had been going on by the way, from the day I came down the escalator with our future first lady
trump, Somebody said to me recently, President, President, it was a friend of mine, used to always call me Donald
trump, Hey Donald, how are you doing Let's go have dinner
trump, Okay, okay, good
trump, Now he calls me President
trump, I told you this before
trump, Calls me pres… They always call me President
trump, President, President, tell me what's happening, what's going on, how's it all going You're doing such a great job
trump, I said, do me a favor
trump, Call me Donald
trump, I can't
trump, Now when they say, you know what that means, right That means respect for the office of president
trump, And you know what We're going to keep that way
trump, We're going to keep it that way
trump, We're going to keep it there
trump, But that's why this November we're going back and we're going to win the House
trump, The Republicans are going to win the House
trump, Because I don't know if you know it
trump, The impeachment hoax, it's a total hoax
trump, This is based… Just think of this
trump, This is based on a perfect phone call
trump, Did anybody read the transcript It's a perfect call
trump, In fact, if you go back and look at Lyndon Johnson, all of them
trump, Lyndon Johnson was sort of a tough guy
trump, Can you imagine his phone calls He's probably looking down or looking up, and he's probably saying, these people have gone crazy
trump, That's the nicest call I've ever tracked
trump, Somebody said, I never knew you could be so nice on a telephone call
trump, But this is all based on a simple phone call that was totally appropriate where the president of Ukraine said there was no pressure on us
trump, Didn't even know what they were talking about
trump, The foreign minister said they want to impeach
trump, Impeach the president of the United States over a perfect phone call
trump, It's the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on our country
trump, Ever
trump, I don't know if you've seen
trump, Independent voters and voters I think of all of the voters, including Democrats moving over, we just got a 195 to nothing, the Republicans in the house, which was a fix
trump, Nancy Pelosi says it must be nonpartisan
trump, And she said, it has to be clear cut
trump, Well, number one, never happened
trump, No problem
trump, Number two, look at the vote
trump, Three Democrats voted with us
trump, So I guess you could say it was a nonpartisan vote because they voted with us, okay But we're going back and we're going to hold the Senate
trump, And we're going to keep the White House, but we're going to win back the House
trump, We're going to win back the House
trump, And I'm thrilled tonight
trump, A man who has become a great friend of mine, he's a warrior
trump, Senator Ron Johnson is here
trump, Come up here
trump, What a good guy
trump, Congressman Bryan Steil
trump, Jim Sensenbrenner
trump, Glenn Grothman
trump, Glenn, come up
trump, Come up
trump, Mike Gallagher
trump, Wisconsin house speaker Robin Voss
trump, Wisconsin state Senate president Roger Roth
trump, State Senate president
trump, Come on fellas
trump, Wisconsin state Senate majority leader Scott Fitzgerald
trump, A friend of mine, a world champion
trump, Would you believe it Is Sean here Where's Sean Where's Sean Get up here
trump, I love champions
trump, He would climb that sucker
trump, He was the best in the world right here from Wisconsin, right Congressman Sean Duffy
trump, We miss him
trump, But he signed with CNN
trump, They paid him a lot of money, and they don't put them on
trump, Why Because I'm pro-Trump
trump, You think that's fair, right He's pro-Trump
trump, So what they've done is paid him money to silence him because he has a very important voice
trump, Great job
trump, Yeah, I like that kind of a job
trump, I think he's okay with it
trump, He gets his check, they refuse to put him on
trump, He says good things about Trump
trump, We don't want you on
trump, That's CNN
trump, That's how fake right there
trump, Turn the camera on
trump, And a good friend of all of ours, a Kenosha native, Reince Priebus
trump, Reince, come up
trump, Thank you, man
trump, Thank you Reince
trump, This is a great group of Republican people, but more importantly, it's a great group of winners
trump, They have been so great, so they worked so hard and I just want to thank you all for being here tonight
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you Ron
trump, A great guy
trump, Thanks to strong Republican leadership like Ron, like all of them that you just saw, America is winning again
trump, America is respected again
trump, And America is thriving again like never before
trump, We're doing great
trump, We're the envy of the world
trump, And under my administration, we now have the lowest average unemployment rate of any administration in the history of our country
trump, And in your great state, Wisconsin… You ever noticed with Biden, he's always calling the wrong state And in your great state of Iowa, Iowa
trump, It's Iowa, right No, it's Wisconsin
trump, Oh, I meant Wisconsin
trump, Oh, I didn't know I was in Wisconsin
trump, That's fine
trump, How many times has he done that, by the way Lots of times, he said
trump, It's great to be in the state of Ohio
trump, No sir, you're in Florida
trump, Many times
trump, The sad part about that… Sleepy Joe is right
trump, You know the sad part about that When you do that, you can't really recover
trump, You can be Winston Churchill, make the finest remainder of remarks, but you get killed
trump, And he does it every time
trump, And the fake news, they give him a total pass and that's okay
trump, It's all right
trump, It's going to happen to all of us someday
trump, Does anybody get that Yeah
trump, In Wisconsin, the unemployment rate has reached its lowest level in history
trump, How's that for a sound bite How do you beat that sound bite, right So now the people of Wisconsin are going to say, well let's see the state set a record, most successful it's ever been
trump, And by the way, that's because we got a lot of help from a guy named Scott Walker
trump, Your governor
trump, Ron Johnson, all those guys
trump, Because this didn't happen so quickly
trump, But think
trump, So how do you beat that You have the most successful, lowest unemployment rate you've ever had
trump, And then they say, somebody's going to come and say, well we'll do a better job
trump, Really, you're going to do a better job The lowest in history by far, your number one economic numbers by far
trump, Oh, let's put somebody else in as president
trump, I don't think so
trump, Right But here's one that I loved the most
trump, African American, Hispanic American, Asian American unemployment rates have reached the lowest levels ever recorded in the history of our country
trump, And here's another one
trump, African American youth, the way it was was so high was so horrible
trump, Youth unemployment has reached an all time low in recorded history
trump, African-American poverty has reached the lowest rate ever recorded also
trump, The only question are you at 70, 80, 90, 97 He goes higher
trump, What are you at What's yours 100
trump, Not bad
trump, I know who he's voting for
trump, But think of this, because this is what it's about
trump, Is that these companies, these big public companies, they're owned by the people, they're owned by everybody
trump, Rich people, and they're owned by everybody
trump, We have set 141 records on the stock market, highest levels ever in recorded history
trump, 141 records
trump, That means, in less than three years, for 141 days, we set a record
trump, Think of it, we've said 141 records
trump, Who the hell can do that And if our opponents had won the election, instead of going up, we're very close to 30,000 on the Dow
trump, Nobody thought that was possible
trump, And clearly the fakers back there, nobody thought that was possible
trump, Instead of being up, you would have… I believe, I really believe, because regulation, so important, tax cuts, so important to get it all going
trump, I believe instead of being up massively, whatever the number is, but depending on who you are, changes, but it's all way over 60, 70, 80, you guys know
trump, You would have been down 50, 60, 70
trump, You would have been down at a level, you would probably be extremely depressed, right now
trump, You wouldn't have bought all those brand new keep America great hats
trump, Don't worry, we're never getting rid of MAGA, don't worry
trump, We don't have the courage to get rid of MAGA
trump, The greatest campaign in history
trump, We're never leaving
trump, But you wouldn't have bought those hats
trump, You know why You wouldn't have the money to buy him
trump, Okay Now you can buy them, it doesn't mean a damn thing
trump, So let's do it real fast
trump, The poll, right Make America great again, or keep America great, right I don't have to go through the whole deal
trump, We're going to do it quick
trump, We're going to do it quickly
trump, Ready Who likes make America great again Whoa
trump, They're very loyal people in Wisconsin
trump, Who likes keep America great All right
trump, So it surprises me every single time
trump, But make America great again, MAGA, has never won one of these polls
trump, You know why We've rebuilt our military, we've cut taxes, we've cut regulation, our stock market hit records
trump, It's called keep America great
trump, I mean, we've done so much
trump, And I just got a free… See these Democrats, they go out and spend 1 million on a poll
trump, What I do is I take my own poll
trump, And they'll interview 203 people
trump, 203 people say they'll get it wrong
trump, Because I'm always surprised
trump, Make America great again I think is the greatest phrase ever used in politics, right But under the Trump economy, the lowest paid earners are reaping the biggest, fastest, and largest games
trump, You know that right This is a blue collar boom
trump, They don't like telling you that
trump, Under my administration, the growth in net worth for the bottom half of wage earners has increased 15 times more than under the three previous administrations
trump, That's pretty amazing
trump, Because they keep saying, oh, the rich are getting richer
trump, Well, the poor are doing the best they've ever done
trump, Earnings for the bottom 10 are rising faster than earnings for the top 10 proportionately
trump, Under eight years of the Barack Hussein Obama administration
trump, Which administration loves spying on people's campaigns By the way, by the way, could you imagine if it were the other way around and I spied on his campaign What would these fake news people be doing More than 300,000 people under Obama, 300,000 people left the workforce
trump, Under just three years of by administration, 3
trump,5 million people have joined the workforce and nobody believed that was possible
trump, 370 companies have signed our pledge to America's workers providing more than 14 million Americans with new training and job opportunities
trump, We're training them
trump, We're getting them, Walmart, so many great companies, they're training people, because they can train a much better than government
trump, 14 million, you know who has worked so hard on that Everybody, you've heard of Ivanka, right Ivanka
trump, She had such a passion for it
trump, She's very smart
trump, I said, would you like this You have no debt
trump, I want to get people working
trump, I want to get them and help families
trump, So I said, all right, good
trump, Look, she's smart
trump, Go do whatever the hell you want to do, it's okay, darling
trump, So she had a goal of a half a million people
trump, She was going to get trained, get into companies
trump, So she'd call Walmart, she'd call Exxon, she'd call all these great companies
trump, And all of a sudden she hit 8 million
trump, Then she hit 9 million
trump, Don't forget, she wanted to do 500,000, but this is her
trump, Then she had 10 million
trump, She just hit 14 million people have been trained by these great companies
trump, 14 million
trump, Ivanka
trump, 14 million, would you believe that's possible But that's why we have the best unemployment rates, we have the best employment rates
trump, By the way, very close to 160 million people are now working in the United States
trump, Nobody's ever even come close to that number
trump, We've lifted 10 million people off federal welfare programs
trump, Real median income is now at the highest level ever recorded in the history of our country
trump, Think of that
trump, Real median income
trump, Under eight years, so we're here three years right, but really less because when it was done, the stats, it was two and a half
trump, But we have less than three
trump, Under eight years of the Bush administration, household incomes grew 400
trump, Eight years, 400
trump, Under eight years of president Obama, household incomes grew 975,000
trump, That's okay, 975
trump, Eight years, right Under three years of the Trump administration, household incomes have risen 10,000
trump, Ten thousand
trump, That's why we're doing well
trump, The consumer
trump, 3,100 of which for regulatory cuts, 2,000 for the tax cuts, it's actually higher than that, 2,500 for energy savings, and 5,000 in real wage gains
trump, 10,000
trump, The child tax credit alone, which every Democrat in Congress opposed, is delivering 2,200 a year to the average American family
trump, Who's in favor of that cut
trump, Who's in favor of having that You People don't know
trump, They think the Democrats gave it
trump, The Democrats give nothing
trump, They're too busy
trump, They're too busy doing other things
trump, They don't do anything
trump, They're too busy doing other things
trump, We ended the war on American energy
trump, The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on earth
trump, Number one in the world by far
trump, Saudi Arabia, Russia, but we're number one by far
trump, And if I get a couple of additional pipelines approved, which I will very quickly, instead of waiting 20 years to get them approved, it'll increase this by another 22 that will get them done quickly
trump, And they'll be environmentally friendly and all of that
trump, I believe in that
trump, We have eliminated a record number of job-destroying regulations
trump, I brought back the old light bulb
trump, Better light for much less money, if you want it, right Little things
trump, Somebody said, oh sir, don't mention the light bulb
trump, It's hard to make an elegant speech
trump, I'm saying I brought back the light bulb
trump, So the new light bulb costs you five times as much, and it makes you look orange
trump, And I was more interested in the orange than I was in the cost
trump, But you know what, if you want, you have it
trump, And the new bulb, I don't know if you see it, it's on there
trump, It's a hazardous waste
trump, When that bulb ends, you're supposed to take it to a certain dump and gingerly put it in because it's loaded up with gasses
trump, That's the new… I said to somebody today in Environmental Protection, how many people do that in the country Sir, maybe none
trump, They throw it into the garbage can
trump, And it's… Wait
trump, And it was just announced from South Korea, makes a lot of our products, unfortunately, I put a tariff on washing machines and refrigerators, right They just announced that they're building major refrigerator and washing machine plants in the United States
trump, You know why You know why Because they don't want to pay the 25 tariff
trump, So they're building them here
trump, That way they don't have to pay the tariff
trump, And just one final thing
trump, I know this doesn't matter, but I said leave it
trump, It's so inelegant to- I know this doesn't matter, but I said leave it
trump, It's so inelegant to talk about it, right Right Isn't it inelegant I'm talking about dishwashers
trump, Wait till you hear the next one
trump, I'm talking about refrigerators
trump, Probably wanting to say to the union, I'll leave it out because I want to get praise for making a … You cannot make a brilliant speech where they say, That was such an incredible, elegant speech, if I'm talking about dishwashers, sinks, toilets, light bulbs
trump, But sinks, toilets and showers, you don't get any water
trump, They put restrictors on and now they made them permanent
trump, People used to take them out
trump, They put restrictors on
trump, Try going and buying a new faucet
trump, You turn it on, no water comes out, right We won't talk about toilets, but you know that's … 10, 15, but we don't talk about that
trump, Because I've said this three or four times, the only subject they ever talk about is toilets, so I don't mention … but how about the shower You go into a shower, and I have this beautiful head of hair, I need a lot of water
trump, I need water
trump, You go into the shower, right You turn on the water, drip, drip, drip
trump, I called the guy, Something wrong with this No, sir
trump, It's just the restrictor
trump, So you're in there five times longer than you're supposed to be
trump, You use probably more water and it's a very unpleasant experience, right So we're getting rid of the restrictors
trump, You're going to have full shower flow
trump, Full sink
trump, Did you ever go to the faucet You turn on the faucet to wash your hands and it turns on so easy
trump, It's like this, because there's zero pressure behind it
trump, No water
trump, You go like that, the thing flips on
trump, Whoa
trump, And then, dung, dung
trump, These people are crazy
trump, And then in California, this governor, who has no clue by the way, he has no clue
trump, Governor Gavin Newsom
trump, He sends all the water out to the Pacific and then he just comes up … I don't know if you saw this
trump, They come up with rules and regulations
trump, Starting soon, if you're a person lives in California, you only get 50 gallons of water
trump, Now, it sounds like a lot of water, but it's not
trump, If you take a shower, wash your hands a couple of times a day … It's not
trump, Then it goes down to 47, 46, 45
trump, Can you imagine You pay the highest taxes outside of New York, where they're not doing a good job in New York
trump, They're not doing good
trump, Everyone's leaving New York for other environs like Florida
trump, It's not good
trump, Because the taxes are too high
trump, Governor Cuomo's got to get those taxes down, got to get them down, and other things have to happen
trump, But here's Gavin Newsom
trump, So, Gavin Newsom, you have the water pouring down from up north, millions and millions of gallons
trump, You know what they do with it They divert it into the Pacific Ocean, because they have … We must be in Wisconsin
trump, No
trump, Millions of gallons coming down from the north
trump, They have this massive valve
trump, You're talking about a valve, this is a serious valve, and they turn it and it … Because they have a tiny, tiny little fish that's doing very poorly with or without the water
trump, So in the meantime, if you own a home on Beverly Hills, they scream at you if you want to water your grass a little bit, right But you have no water coming in
trump, They divert millions and millions of gallons
trump, And what we've just done for the people of California is we've made it possible on a federal basis that they don't have to divert all that water anymore
trump, Now that's only good for California, but these are the things we do
trump, And now the last one is we're working on cars
trump, We're making them less expensive and safer
trump, We're giving them a tiny little bit more fuel and you're going to save on average 3,500
trump, You're going to have a heavier car, a little bit, meaning you'll have steel instead of paper mache walls
trump, And we're getting a lot of good response
trump, And environmentally, it's better, because now people … the number is 12
trump, From 12 years ago, with the old gas guzzlers, they'll all be trading in their cars to get the new cars, which they don't do right now
trump, So it's really going to be something, and we're in a little fight with California over that
trump, But I think ultimately we win that one
trump, You'll buy a better car, a safer car, for less money
trump, Not a bad combination
trump, Not a bad thing
trump, To lift up forgotten communities that need investment the most, we've created opportunity zones
trump, Jobs and investment are now pouring into 120 newly designated opportunity zones right here in Wisconsin
trump, And Ron Johnson helped and Tim Scott of South Carolina helped, right They're doing great
trump, They are doing good
trump, And for decades politicians ran for office promising to defend Wisconsin workers, but then they went to Washington and lined their pockets with special interest cash as they shipped your jobs and your dreams to countries thousands of miles away
trump, Countries that you've never even heard of
trump, Globalist politicians lowered our economic defenses and allowed other nations to rob your factories, steal your farms
trump, By the way, no estate tax on those beautiful farms
trump, We got rid of that
trump, So now, if you love your children and you have a farm or a small business or small ranch, or even a large ranch, you have no estate tax
trump, You can give it to the kids
trump, If you don't love your children … Anybody in here does not love their children There are some
trump, Come on, raise your hand
trump, There are some
trump, You know, they're brats
trump, They're little brats
trump, They're horrible human beings
trump, So if you're one of them, this doesn't help you, because you'll save some tax
trump, The fact is, no estate tax on these small businesses and farms
trump, That's a tremendous thing, because you are dying, you are leaving the business to your kids
trump, They all said, Thank you very much, Daddy and Mommy, and then they went out and mortgaged the hell out of the place and they ended up losing it to the banks
trump, But we got rid of the estate tax on small farms and businesses and really great things
trump, Little stuff like that we've done that we never said we were going to do, but these people were ransacking your communities
trump, But we are defenseless no more, because at long last you have a president who puts America first
trump, Been a long time
trump, Been a long time
trump, Been a long time
trump, We're putting America first
trump, No issue of Washington Democrats more thoroughly betrayed the American people than that of immigration
trump, He goes, Traitor
trump, Are you having a good time, sir I think you are
trump, Goes, Traitor
trump, I guess in a certain way they are traitors, when you think about it
trump, Left wing politicians, I call them the Do Nothing Democrats, support deadly sanctuary cities, demonstrating their contempt, scorn and disdain for everyday Americans
trump, These jurisdictions release dangerous, violent, criminal aliens out of their jails and directly onto your streets where they are free to rob, attack and murder American citizens
trump, You have it right here
trump, You have it right here
trump, Last year, ICE … I love ICE
trump, I think they're so great
trump, You know, they moved thousands of MS-13 out of our country, thousands, and others too
trump, But ICE officers in this region of our country arrested nearly 7,000 illegal aliens with criminal records
trump, So you have 7,000 illegal aliens having criminal records, including those charged or convicted of murder, burglary, robbery, drug crimes, killings in the most violent way
trump, Right here in Wisconsin, cities run by far left politicians are releasing dangerous criminal aliens who abuse, assault and threaten innocent children
trump, Your children
trump, Last year, a place I like, the sanctuary County of Milwaukee, released an illegal alien criminal with multiple charges for sexual assault of child
trump, Think of that, of children
trump, He's now at large
trump, They're searching all over and he's looking for yet another victim
trump, They're searching all over
trump, Allowed to go from your sanctuary city
trump, In the city of Madison, police arrested an illegal alien for sexual assault
trump, After authorities released him, he committed violent battery, only to be released one more time
trump, They're looking for him again
trump, Isn't that nice The same illegal alien was then arrested for a third time in September and charged with multiple sexual assaults, including sexual assault of a child
trump, Now that criminal is once again in Wisconsin jail and I call on your left wing officials to stop the madness and to work with ICE to ensure he is deported the hell back home
trump, Get him out of our country
trump, Democrats stand for crime, corruption and chaos
trump, Republicans stand for law, order and justice
trump, It's true
trump, It's true
trump, We believe Wisconsin should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens
trump, We are removing these illegal criminals and gang members by the tens of thousands and we will not let them back
trump, We made a deal with Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico, where they accept them back
trump, Under the Obama administration, they get them, they bring them back
trump, And Honduras and Guatemala, which they get that, we're not taking them back, but with us, they take them back
trump, They take them back
trump, Very great
trump, It helped a lot when we were paying them hundreds of millions of dollars a year
trump, Think of it
trump, I just said, we're not paying them anymore
trump, All of a sudden they said, We would love to have our wonderful gang members back
trump, We would love to have our gang members back, sir
trump, Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, we have reduced illegal border crossings, seven straight months in a row, and we're being helped by our new 100 miles plus of wall
trump, Illegal crossings are down 78 since May and we have ended catch and release
trump, That was a tough one
trump, Our very big and very powerful border wall is going up at a record speed and we're fully financed now
trump, Isn't that nice That wasn't easy
trump, That was not easy
trump, We're adding new miles every week and we are on track to soon build that wall
trump, You're going to have a wall like no other
trump, It's going to be a powerful, terrific wall
trump, And walls do work
trump, I hate to say, remember the Democrats, You don't need walls
trump, Oh really We need drones
trump, They wanted us to put drones flying around, taking pictures of everybody
trump, Now, did you see on part of the new wall two days ago, illegal aliens with drugs on their back were climbing the wall
trump, They got to the top
trump, You know that paddle on top is called a climb resistor
trump, It's very slippery and very hot, very hot, and they got stuck on the wall
trump, They couldn't get off the wall
trump, Did you see that I was watching the news
trump, I was surprised that the fake news showed it and I said, Isn't that a beautiful sight They couldn't get over the wall
trump, Couldn't get off
trump, They had to get the fire department to get them down
trump, Do you believe that 30 feet up, that's like almost a four story building
trump, Washington Democrats have never been more extreme than they are now
trump, They're going crazy
trump, They're going totally loony
trump, Nervous nancy, how about Nervous … How about her district Her district is so filthy dirty
trump, It's filthy dirty with all of the things, I won't say it, but the needles and everything else
trump, These are areas that were, 10 years ago, the best in the country and now they're disgusting
trump, She ought to spend more time back in San Francisco taking care of her community, instead of wasting everybody's time
trump, But taking their cues from socialist Bernie Sanders, AOC, all these people, liberal lawmakers are pushing a government takeover of healthcare that would strip 180 million Americans of their private health insurance
trump, Many of you have great insurance
trump, Republicans will never let that happen
trump, They'll probably change their mind before the … See, this is why I don't like talking about it now
trump, I'd rather wait six, seven, eight months, let them say it 5, 000 times when they have to do it, and then talk extreme late term abortion, because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God won five times
trump, I said, I've done one, but I've won
trump, But it's the beep
trump, But no, seriously, we're all smart people
trump, How is it good when they say, We're going to raise your taxes Is the world going crazy They say, We're going to raise your taxes
trump, We're going to open borders
trump, Everybody can come in … for everybody's health insurance
trump, Schooling
trump, You know, one time … we're going to get everybody a Rolls Royce, and CNN or one of them said, They never said, and they never promised a Rolls Royce
trump, Donald Trump lied tonight
trump, I said, Every illegal alien will have a Rolls Royce
trump, They said, He lied tonight
trump, These people are sick
trump, But they're the party of late term abortion, socialism and corruption
trump, The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American Dream, and of course, honest Abe Lincoln, right Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background and from every race, religion, color, and creed
trump, We are a movement
trump, There's a movement like nobody's ever seen before
trump, You know, when I mention this, anything I say that's even slightly false, it's headlines
trump, Trump said this
trump, These people
trump, He said this
trump, This is one of the greatest … I would say this
trump, This is the greatest movement in the history of our country
trump, I really believe that
trump, Never been a movement like this
trump, I mean, there have been some great movements where somebody came along and out of nowhere won the state of New Hampshire, won Iowa, won South Carolina down the way, won a state some place
trump, But we won 32 states
trump, There's never been a movement like this, never happened before
trump, But we're a movement for all Americans who believe in fairness and justice, equality and dignity, opportunity and safety
trump, We are a big tent and we are a big party of big ideas for the future
trump, That's why African Americans are joining the Republican Party like nobody ever thought even possible
trump, They love us and we love them
trump, And to give former prisoners a second chance at life, we passed
trump, It was us, not the Democrats
trump, They came to me, they wanted help, I gave them help
trump, I got it done
trump, I called Republicans that maybe wouldn't have been so inclined, some of them
trump, Some of them very much inclined
trump, Some of them very conservative were very much inclined
trump, But I got the people that we needed
trump, Obama couldn't do it
trump, Bush couldn't do it
trump, Nobody could do it
trump, I got it approved, and from the day it was approved, I got no thanks, I got no credit
trump, And that's okay, because you know, right But we passed bi-partisan criminal justice reform and that's helped so many people
trump, I mean, you know the story of Alice Johnson
trump, You know so many different stories
trump, It's helped so many people, especially in the African-American community, the Hispanic community
trump, It's helped a lot of people
trump, It's a different world
trump, To uphold the rule of law, we have confirmed 187 federal judges, a record, who will interpret the constitution as written
trump, 187
trump, Last spring, Wisconsin voters, as you know, elected a great judge to your State Supreme Court, and this spring you have a chance to reelect another terrific judge, Justice Daniel Kelly
trump, Go vote for Justice Daniel Kelly to defend the rule of law in Wisconsin
trump, Daniel Kelly
trump, We are aggressively combating the opioid epidemic and we've done great … Look, until you get rid of it, you never did great, but we have done numbers that nobody thought possible
trump, In 2018, drug overdose deaths, the overdose deaths, fell for the first time in decades, including by 10 in the state of Wisconsin, 17, 18, 19 and even 21 in a couple of states
trump, China is now putting a big stop, a big lid on Fentanyl, which is a disaster coming out of China
trump, Said to president, You've got to do it
trump, People are dying, got to do it
trump, They're doing it
trump, We are fighting very hard for school choice and it's moving along well in Wisconsin
trump, Milwaukee created the first school choice program 30 years ago to free children for failing government schools, and now my administration is working to give school choice to every child in America who needs it
trump, As we continue rebuilding our military, workers are building brand new Humvee replacements … you know about that … in Oshkosh and magnificent new little old combat ships in Marinette
trump, A lot of ships, a lot of Humvees
trump, I recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem
trump, We recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, something they've been trying to get for 52 years
trump, For years you watched as your politicians apologized for America
trump, Now you have a president who is standing up for America, and we are standing up for you, the people of Wisconsin
trump, At stake in our present battle is the survival of the nation
trump, What these people are doing, they will destroy our nation
trump, They will destroy our nation
trump, And our last election was so important
trump, I don't know, maybe the most important ever, but it was so important
trump, I really believe that this election maybe in its own way will be just as important
trump, I can't say more, but just as important, because we need time for that tree to grow
trump, You plant a tree and it takes time
trump, We need time for that tree to grow, and we have other things that we want to do
trump, If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for to secure, then we must devote everything we have toward victory in 2020
trump, Have to do it
trump, Only this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp once and for all, and I have found out what a swamp it is
trump, Bad people
trump, I have become the expert all what a swamp
trump, You know, when I used to say, Drain the swamp, I had no idea it would be that bad
trump, But we're winning
trump, We're here and they're not
trump, We're winning
trump, We're winning
trump, Bad people
trump, Dishonest, bad people
trump, With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity
trump, Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration, which now we're already doing
trump, We're already doing a lot of it
trump, You've got to get loopholes
trump, You know, you need their votes
trump, We have loopholes, like visa lottery
trump, We put names in a lottery and they come in, they become American citizens
trump, Do you think these countries are giving us their finest Oh, let's give them our best citizens, put them in
trump, These people are crazy to allow this to happen, so we're stopping it all
trump, But ending catch and release was a very big thing, and we did that with no Democrat help
trump, They wouldn't do it
trump, It's called loopholes
trump, Who wouldn't want to end loopholes We will enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase, Made in the USA
trump, We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America in less than 10 years
trump, Who would've thought that We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms
trump, And above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America
trump, We support, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States of America
trump, We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement
trump, We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life
trump, We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way
trump, We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag
trump, And we live by the words of our national motto, In God we trust
trump, They'll always be there
trump, We'll never let up remove it
trump, Those words will always be there
trump, From Milwaukee to Monroe, from Bayfield to Green Bay, good luck this weekend
trump, And from West Bend to West Dallas, we stand on the shoulders of the most courageous men and women ever to walk on the face of the earth
trump, Our American ancestors crossed the oceans, settled a continent, tamed the wilderness, revolutionized industry, pioneered science, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, landed men on the face of the moon, and made America the greatest nation in the history of the world, and we are making it greater than ever before
trump, Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country
trump, We are returning power to you, the American people
trump, With your help, your devotion and your drive we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning
trump, We are one movement
trump, We are one people
trump, We are one family and one glorious nation under God
trump, America is thriving like never before, and ladies and gentlemen of Wisconsin, the best is yet to come
trump, You watch
trump, Because working together, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again
trump, Thank you, Wisconsin
trump, Thank you
trump,
trump,Well, I thank you very much
trump, So I want to start by saying, Hello, Nevada
trump, How are you doing How are you And I'm thrilled to be in Douglas County, but people are coming from all over the place
trump, There's a lot of people for Douglas County, isn't it We have thousands and thousands of loyal, hardworking American patriots, that's what we have
trump, And 52 days from now, we're going to win Nevada, and we're going to win four more years in the White House
trump, And then after that we'll negotiate, right ‘Cause we're probably, based on the way we were treated, we're probably entitled to another four after that
trump, And it should never happen to another President
trump, That's just a dishonest group of people
trump, But here we are, and we're going to be here for another four years
trump, The governor of your state- … tried very hard to stop us from having this event tonight
trump, He didn't like us having… They can have riots and they can have all sorts of things and that's okay, you can burn up the house, that's okay
trump, We call this a protest because if you call it a protest, you're allowed to have it
trump, It's okay
trump, So if anybody asks you outside, this is called a friendly protest, okay It's true
trump, You can't have political rallies
trump, That's because of me, because if Biden were here, he'd have about three people
trump, Do you ever see him with his little circles The circle You know why he puts the circles Because he wants to be like correct with COVID, but it's not really because they can't get anybody to fill up a room
trump, So they put these big circles
trump, So he can't get anybody to fill
trump, Nobody wants to go
trump, Oh, boy, the fake news, look at all those people back there, the fakers
trump, That's true
trump, Boy, they covered
trump, Did you see the other day, now they're finding out that to do an interview, an interview, they ask him a question
trump, That means they're giving him the questions, they never gave me questions before
trump, So to do an interview, he demands on getting the questions, and his people write out the answer
trump, So they ask him a question
trump, He goes, Bring it up closer, I can't see it, dammit
trump, Great
trump, This is something
trump, You know, we have a debate coming up in three weeks
trump, And here's the problem
trump, Winston Churchill
trump, Did you ever hear of Winston Churchill Winston Churchill was a great debater
trump, Great
trump, And if Joe gets off the stage, walks off the stage, if he makes it, which I think he probably will, in all fairness, he's been doing this for 47 years, right I think he probably will
trump, If he gets off the stage, they're going to say it was the single greatest debate they've ever seen
trump, Winston Churchill was nothing compared to Sleepy Joe
trump, You know that, you know that, they're going to say, What a great performance
trump, He was great today
trump, He was great
trump, This guy was great
trump, Nah, he's not great
trump, But your governor tried to stop us
trump, He tried to stop us
trump, The governor of Nevada, he tried to stop us, and we went to different venues
trump, Kelly O'Donnell, she's a fading reporter for NBC
trump, Do you know that She was on, she said, Well, they have a crowd tonight
trump, Behind her, it looked like 25,000 people
trump, That's what we have, by the way, a lot more coming in
trump, But she said, He's got maybe a thousand people, a thousand
trump, You know what I got I have a thousand people here
trump, No, this is the fake news
trump, You know what It's not a question of how many… They are just a bunch of dishonest people, I've never seen anything like it
trump, Being in real estate and being in New York and being in all over, I've seen a lot of dishonest people
trump, I think the media, the fake news is the most dishonest group of people I've ever seen anywhere in my entire life
trump, And that includes, by the way, leaders of foreign countries that aren't our friends, okay That's a big statement
trump, They really are bad news
trump, But here we are, and this is really amazing
trump, The governor tried to stop us, he couldn't, but think of this, he's in control of millions of votes
trump, Here's a guy calling venues, telling them not to have the rally, calling different venues, Don't have the rally
trump, We're not going to let you have the rally
trump, And he's calling, this governor who was a political hack, he was a political hack, and then he became governor
trump, And this is the guy that we're entrusting with millions of ballots, unsolicited ballots, millions and millions
trump, And then we're supposed to win these states, and we have a guy that would do that where he won't let us have, and we call it a protest and therefore we can do it
trump, But you want to know something It's a disgrace
trump, So who the hell is going to trust They say, Trust government
trump, Well, how would you trust a guy that fought that we aren't here, that we can't have all these thousands of people Boy, you are really back far
trump, That's… Look at that
trump, No, but seriously
trump, And now he's in charge of the election and the millions of ballots
trump, So if I'm up like millions of votes, he can rig the election, he can rig the election
trump, And I'll tell you what, whether it's in North Carolina, whether it's in Michigan, whether it's in other states where they're sending out, they're going to be sending out 80 million ballots
trump, And it's Democrats
trump, They're trying to rig this election, at every single place in the last year, year and a half, go modern day, forget about… Tiny amounts, a congressional race in New York, a small number of votes
trump, If you go to New Jersey, if you go to Virginia, if you go to Pennsylvania, if you go to California, look at some of these races, every one of these races was a fraud, missing ballots
trump, And I don't mean like 1
trump, I mean like 20, 25, they're trying to rig the election
trump, They should make people, if you register, if you want a solicited ballot, that's where you ask for it
trump, You have to sign papers
trump, You get it because you can't be there
trump, That's one thing
trump, When they send 80 million ballots to people, they have no idea where they're going
trump, Actually, they probably do have a good idea where they're going, and that's our problem
trump, They send 80 million ballots out
trump, Where are they going Who are they sending them to Are they sending them to certain areas and not other areas Are they sending them to Democrat areas These are all controlled by Democrat governors, like your politically motivated governor
trump, So, just to finish on that, look, just to finish on that, he's a guy that tried to silence us by not having this
trump, And it ended up, our crowd turned out to be a lot bigger than NBC, which is owned by Concast
trump, C-O-N, Concast
trump, C-O-N-C-A-S-T, Concast
trump, It's really Comcast, but I call it con because it's a whole con
trump, I'll tell you what, in the old days, I think it should still be, news when they broadcast had to be reasonably accurate, right And they had licensing
trump, Today, they can do whatever the hell they want
trump, It's fake news, and it's a disgrace
trump, And you know what, back there, and I'll tell you, it's hurting our country
trump, It's hurting our country
trump, They're the biggest problem that this country has is the fake news media, worse than the Democrats, because the Democrats are their partners
trump, They play together
trump, Joe Biden spent the last 47 years selling out America, offshoring your jobs, throwing open your borders, depleting our military and sacrificing your children's future in China
trump, I've spent the last four years bringing our jobs back to America, securing our borders, rebuilding our military and standing up to China like never before
trump, Nobody has ever stood up to China like we have stood up to China, and you haven't seen the last of it
trump, Sleepy Joe Biden, who surrendered, you know where he is now, he's in his damn basement again
trump, No, he's in his basement
trump, He's in his basement
trump, But I can be bad to him because he put the most vicious ad on television that I've ever seen
trump, Do you know what I'm talking about Where I'm standing over the graves of our fallen warriors, our fallen heroes
trump, These are great people, the greatest people there are, and I'm standing over there and they have some sleazebag reporter from a third rate magazine having some source quoting me saying, I won't even use the term, but saying bad things
trump, And there's nobody that loves our military, respects it and the people more than me
trump, And they took… And I didn't even ask
trump, We had 25 people that were witnesses that are on the record already that have said that never took place
trump, It never took place, what they said
trump, And yet pathetic Joe, and he's a pathetic human being to allow that to happen
trump, Here's the problem, he doesn't even know what happened, I don't think
trump, I think he has no idea, but he's a pathetic human being to let that happen, where they put an ad like that, where I'm standing over graves
trump, And then they said, He said this, with no sources, no nothing
trump, They got nothing
trump, And I have 25 real witnesses with the names, with everything, saying it never happened
trump, And they put an ad like that up, they're a disgrace
trump, But you know the good part Now I can be really vicious
trump, I can be really vicious
trump, And we'll start by saying, we're going to start by saying that the Democrats are trying to rig this election because it's the only way they're going to win
trump, The only way they're going to win is to rig it
trump, Biden's surrendered your jobs to China
trump, Look, his son walked away with a billion and a half dollars, give me a break, give me a… His son's going to say, Dad, you can't take this money away
trump, Don't do it, Dad, please, I don't… You know how much experience he had There's a young man here, he's a very young, young man, handsome young guy
trump, He's about like 12
trump, You know what He's got more experience than Hunter
trump, Hunter
trump, Where's Hunter Where is he With no experience, no knowledge of energy, no job, got thrown out of the military… You know he got thrown out, by the way
trump, I used to be nice about that
trump, Now I don't
trump, Once I saw that ad, I don't have to be nice anymore
trump, Okay, I really mean it
trump, And by the way, on that ad, I know some horrible people, horrible human beings, some of the worst people in the world, I really do, they're horrible, none of those people, and they're the worst, the worst, real estate developers in New York, you don't get much worse
trump, I know some of the worst people in the world, not one person do I know that would say that, standing on top of graves, of heroes, really, not one person
trump, So I will tell you this, so now we can play it like it is
trump, Let's face it, Joe is shot
trump, Let's face it, okay He's shot
trump, So not that he has anything to do because he won't know what's happening
trump, He'll just be locked up in a room someplace, and the radical left is going to be running our country
trump, Four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years Thank you
trump, But now he wants to surrender our country to the violent left wing mob
trump, You know that
trump, If Biden wins, China wins
trump, If Biden wins, the mob wins
trump, You see what's going on with all these democratic or I always say Democrat-run cities and states
trump, It's a disaster
trump, It's a disaster
trump, And we keep saying, Let us bring in the troops
trump, Well, we did it in Minneapolis, we ended it
trump, In 45 minutes, it was ended
trump, They went through two weeks
trump, By the way, we could do it in Portland in half an hour
trump, It would all be over
trump, But we have these stupid people that think… How about that poor mayor Is that pathetic, Wheeler, is that pathetic They forced him out of his home
trump, He's now finding a new home, it's so nice
trump, It's pathetic
trump, Honestly, it's pathetic
trump, We could solve that problem in a half an hour, just like we did
trump, And by the way, the US Marshals did a great job in Portland
trump, They did a great job
trump, You know what I mean
trump, If Biden wins, the rioters win, the anarchists win, arsonists, flag burners, they all win
trump, I'm running for reelection to bring prosperity to Nevada, to the whole country
trump, I've been here a long time
trump, I have some things in Nevada that are very good to put violent criminals behind bars and to ensure the future belongs to America, not to China
trump, I do get a kick out of watching a guy, Oh, I'm going to do this
trump, He copied my whole plan
trump, You see, he says, Buy America, I said, Where the hell have you been for the last half century Thank you
trump, Could I ask the fake news to take your cameras and show all the way back there for hundreds of yards, all the way back there
trump, Take your cameras
trump, Go as far as the eye can see
trump, No, no, tell NBC News it's not a thousand people
trump, You can't see it
trump, You can't see it down here
trump, You won't believe how many people
trump, That thing goes back… So the bottom line is when we win, America wins, that's what's happening
trump, And nobody's done to China what I did
trump, Look, billions, tens of billions of dollars of tariffs we took in
trump, I gave 28 billion to farmers
trump, The farmers are doing very well
trump, They're doing very well
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you, President Trump
trump, 28 billion
trump, 16 billion one year 12 billion
trump, They were targeted
trump, I said, How much is it Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture, great guy, said, How much were they hurt by Sir, 12 billion two years ago and 16 billion last year
trump, I said, All right, good
trump, We'll take it out of China
trump, We gave them 28 billion, to the farmers
trump, That never happened before
trump, You think Joe Biden would even think about it He wouldn't even think about it
trump, He wouldn't even think about it
trump, No, he's more worried about, does he have a teleprompter to answer a reporter's question
trump, The worst part about that isn't the fact that he's doing that, because let's face it, he's unable, okay It's not that, it's that the fake news would give him the questions
trump, They never gave me the questions
trump, Did you ever give me questions, back there Did you ever give me… They don't give me questions
trump, The fake news would give him questions, but of course now Donna Brazile works for Fox, so that's gone a long way
trump, Remember Remember when Donna Brazile gave crooked Hillary the questions, right To a debate And then she said, Well, I don't think I did it
trump, I don't remember
trump, I knew she was in trouble when she said, I don't remember doing that
trump, I don't remember
trump, She didn't remember
trump, Oh, okay
trump, Well, as long as you don't remember
trump, It's true
trump, It's true too
trump, It's true
trump, You know what, I used to stand back and I'd say, Be quiet, please
trump, Don't say that
trump, It's really not nice
trump, You know it's true
trump, She deleted 33… Think of it
trump, They'll never find the emails because they were acid washed, deleted
trump, But you know what She got a subpoena from the United States Congress, right And she and her lawyer deleted 33,000 emails after she got a United States subpoena
trump, And you say, Why isn't she guilty of a major crime Right And then she took her telephones and she smashed them with a hammer
trump, Right And then she took the other ones, and she deleted them
trump, And now the Mueller scam, these people, the worst people
trump, I have a friend, a very smart guy, very streetwise guy
trump, He said, You have to be the most honest guy in the world to go through three years of investigations, where they have the worst human beings in the world
trump, They worked for the Democrats
trump, They worked… I mean, Mueller didn't have a clue
trump, This guy was totally… But look at this Weissmann, how bad was Weissmann He deleted his phone
trump, That's illegal
trump, He deleted everything
trump, They all deleted
trump, And they all said, Oh gee, we made a mistake
trump, We're sorry
trump, They all used the same mistake
trump, They all made… It was, Oh gee, we didn't mean to do that
trump, Every one of them, all of them
trump, I think it was 31 different phones, they deleted
trump, These are criminals we're dealing with
trump, And they've got to… There has to be a repercussion
trump, There has to be a repercussion
trump, We're dealing with criminals
trump, So I don't care if you say it anymore because you know what She illegally deleted, and her lawyers should go to jail with her, okay And the fact is the Republican party doesn't play it rough and tough like those people, they don't play it the same way
trump, They're too nice
trump, And we have better policy
trump, Thank goodness we have better… We believe in borders
trump, We believe in no sanctuary cities
trump, We believe in lowering taxes
trump, We have better, but our people don't… We have some that are very good
trump, Jim Jordan, good, right Jim Jordan
trump, Mark Meadows, good, right No, we have some very good, but I'll tell you what, we play it so nice, and in the end it's not right because what they get away with… And Obama and Biden got caught spying on our campaign using the intelligence, I put that in quotes, using intelligence to spy on our campaign, and they got caught
trump, They got caught
trump, And if it was me that got caught, forget about it
trump, But they got caught and somebody said,  Well I know, but he was President
trump, Oh great, I'm President too
trump, And a hell of a lot better President than he is, I can tell you that
trump, Obama came into office, they gave him the Nobel Prize, like almost immediately, right In fact, he didn't even know why he got it
trump, He didn't even know, he had no idea why he got it
trump, And he was right about that because nobody else does either
trump, They still don't know, but we've done a lot of things
trump, So we were nominated a few days ago for a Nobel Prize, which is a big thing
trump, Nobel Peace Prize
trump, And then yesterday we were nominated a second time for another Nobel Prize
trump, Now, that's a big thing
trump, To me, it's a big thing, even though obviously it's a very political thing, but it's a very big thing
trump, The Nobel Peace Prize, right I got, it was just reported
trump, I'm just reporting this, I got zero time on the nightly news, on the network news
trump, Zero, zero
trump, We got zero time
trump, Think of it, the President of your country is honored by being nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, and your nightly news, ABC, which is terrible, CBS, which is terrible, and probably the worst of all owned by Concast, they spend a fortune on PR, and then every time I get up, I call them Concast and sort of wipe out their fortune
trump, But they are bad people
trump, But NBC is the worst of them all, not one mentioned
trump, These people are corrupt
trump, Not one mentioned, not one mentioned
trump, So your President gets a Nobel and, at least a nomination, and they don't mention it
trump, Joe Biden cannot lead our country because he doesn't really believe in our country
trump, Right now, I don't think he believes in anything, he just wants to go to sleep
trump, That's all
trump, Please, darling, I want to go to bed
trump, I'm exhausted
trump, I made one speech yesterday
trump, But darling, they gave you the answers and the questions
trump, I know, but that was a big strain because my eyes, I couldn't see the teleprompter
trump, This guy is the worst
trump, I am… And you know, it's going to maybe come back to haunt me because we have a rigged election
trump, It's a rigged election
trump, It's the only way we're going to lose, but I'll tell you what, he is the worst candidate in the history of Presidential… He is the worst candidate in the history of presidential politics
trump, He doesn't know he's alive
trump, He doesn't know he's alive
trump, And I got to know President Xi of China very well, President Putin of Russia, Kim Jong-un
trump, By the way, what happened to the war I thought we was going to war with Kim Jong-un
trump, Where's the war Where's the war Oh, I see
trump, Oh, I see
trump, It never happened, did it Never happened, did it Well, maybe some day, could happen
trump, No, remember Trump is going to be …  You know my personality, right Trump is going to be a war at within the first week after he wins
trump, Where's the war
trump,In fact, the peace prize was because I stayed out of wars, and by the way, ended certain Wars that could have happened that you don't even know about
trump, And look what we did just yesterday in Europe, and look what we did with Israel, and you just saw that, with United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you very much
trump, Thank you very much
trump, Now, after this is over, you'll have like at NBC, this third-rate reporter stand up
trump, They had a small crowd, a insignificant crowd, in a great location
trump, You know how great it was We landed, we had to drive for 50 minutes
trump, That's how great
trump, But I like it anyway
trump, I'll take it
trump, I'll take it anyway
trump, I like it
trump, You're my kind of people
trump, We love each other
trump, I like it
trump, We landed the big, beautiful Air Force One
trump, I just asked as we're coming in, Why couldn't we have landed here I would have rather, then I could have had the plane right behind me
trump, Instead, we have the beast
trump, See the beast
trump, What you don't know is the beast costs almost as much as the plane
trump, It's a hell of a car
trump, It's a walking army tank, the beast
trump, But we could have
trump, I said, Why don't we just land here And we couldn't
trump, So I get off the plane
trump, Oh, good
trump, How long will it be About 50 minutes
trump, That's a long drive
trump, And driving here, there were tens of thousands of people on the streets with flags
trump, And then you read these fake reporters and they say, President Trump is tied in Nevada, tied
trump, I don't think so
trump, The only way we're tied is if they screw around with the ballots, which they will do in my opinion
trump, Okay We're not tied anywhere
trump, I asked some people that traveled with Obama
trump, I said, Was it the same thing They say, Not even a tiny fraction of what you have
trump, There's not even a fraction
trump, We have more enthusiasm
trump, We have more spirit than any campaign that anybody's ever seen
trump, It's true
trump, And that includes 2016, where the enthusiasm obviously was great
trump, How about all those states that we weren't supposed to win No, he won't win there
trump, He won't win there
trump, Then all night long, Donald Trump won the great state of Texas
trump, Donald Trump won the great state of …  this and that, and one after another
trump, Was that one of the coolest things, watching their people go crazy They went crazy
trump, No, they went crazy
trump, How is he going to do in Georgia Well, I think George is going to be very close
trump, It's going to be very close
trump, They go, The polls in Georgia have closed
trump, Donald Trump wins the state of Georgia
trump, You know why Because we won by so much, that they can do it simultaneously by saying, The polls closed, and he won
trump, We had many of them
trump, Right And by the way, we're doing great
trump, I just had … Florida is a biggie, a good one
trump, And we are winning in Florida by a lot, so that's good
trump, A lot
trump, I'll tell you here, because you don't read about that stuff
trump, They don't like to write that
trump, They don't like to write it
trump, They have all fake polls
trump, I'll tell you what, the polls are worse than the writing
trump, Actually, in my opinion, the polls, they're suppression polls, they're meant to make people discouraged, Even me, I'm supposed to be discouraged
trump, And fortunately, four years ago, we weren't discouraged, because if we would have believed the polls, nobody would have voted
trump, The concept is really make people feel so that on election, they go, Darling, let's go out to dinner
trump, It's so sad about the president
trump, I wish he was going to win, but let's go out to dinner
trump, Then we'll come home
trump, Let's not bother voting, right Let's not bother voting
trump, See, it's a suppression, but my people might don't get suppressed
trump, My people go out and vote
trump, My people go out and vote
trump, There's no suppression
trump, Phony polls
trump, How about the guy The New York times hired this pollster, this great genius
trump, He never called one wrong
trump, I don't know
trump, Three, 46
trump,
trump, I don't know what the hell … It's called three 40 … What's his deal 00
trump, We were given a very tiny chance
trump, What chance did he give us Like 9, something like that
trump, You know, they gave him millions of dollars shortly before, because he never called one wrong
trump, He called that one wrong
trump, He called that one wrong
trump, And this is the one … I mean, I must tell you they're a little more accurate
trump, At least here they have us even in a lot of places
trump,  He's even
trump, Well, we're not even, we're not even
trump, This is going to be the greatest victory
trump, This is a more important election than four years ago, I'll tell you, more important
trump, Because at no time before, has there been a clearer choice between two parties or two visions, two philosophies, two agendas for the future
trump, There's never been anything like this
trump, On November 3rd, Nevada will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity, like we had
trump, We had the greatest economy in the history … not of our country, in the world
trump, We were beating everybody
trump, We were beating China
trump, Remember, if you go back, some of you go back, if you go back 10 years, 15 years, five years, everything was … In 2019, China will overtake the United States as the largest economy
trump, And that didn't work out too well for them
trump, That didn't work out
trump, We were just doing leaps and bounds
trump, We were doing so great, and then we got hit with the plague, the China plague
trump, And we're not thrilled
trump, It's a disgrace
trump, Nobody should have died
trump, Nobody should have died
trump, We got hit
trump, The whole world got hit, but they stopped it from going into the rest of China
trump, They stopped it from going into China, but they didn't stop it from coming into the US and Europe and 188 countries
trump, So whether or not we allow Biden to impose the biggest tax increase in the history of our country, 4 trillion, or ban … He wants to ban energy, ban American … He wants to stop fracking
trump, Hey, by the way, when he was running as a Democrat, in the worst debate performances I've ever seen
trump, Okay What do you think … He was unable to answer anything
trump, Are you awake, sir Sir, please wake up
trump, And who was the worst Who treated him the worst Kamala
trump, Kamala
trump, She's another beauty
trump, She started off as a favorite
trump, She was at 15
trump, Then she went down to 14, to 12, to 10
trump, She was like a dropping rock in water
trump, She was going down so fast
trump, Then she went down to five and four and three, two, and then she said, I got to get the hell out of here
trump, This is getting embarrassing
trump, And nobody treated him worse than Kamala
trump, Right She called him a racist
trump, She called him everything
trump, She was horrible to him
trump, And he says, She was Kamala
trump, She's just great
trump, Oh, yeah
trump, These people, these people
trump, You're supposed to choose the people that did well
trump, She got out before Iowa, as I remember
trump, Right She didn't want to run in Iowa, and then Bernie got … Again, this guy is the greatest loser ever because- No, no
trump, No, he's a good sport, Bernie, crazy Bernie
trump, He's so crazy, but he's a good sport, because with Hillary, they really did
trump, Do we have any young children here I know it's on a lot of television
trump, Could you turn the television off just for a minute, just for about three seconds He got screwed
trump, Right Okay
trump, Now you can turn it back on
trump, But then they really did with this last one, because if Pocahontas, Elizabeth Warren, if she would have left the race one day before the big Super Tuesday, I mean, Bernie would have her philosophy, right Liberals
trump, And I would say, she'll be president
trump, If he ever wants, she'll be president within the first month or so, I would say
trump, I think it's just an excuse
trump, Using him as just an excuse to get the super libs in there, so they can destroy our suburbs, demolish our Second Amendment, erase your borders and indoctrinate your children with poisonous, anti-American lies in school
trump, So under my leadership, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world
trump, And now we're doing it again
trump, We're doing it again
trump, You've seen the numbers
trump, And we're developing a vaccine in record time
trump, It will be ready before the end of the year and maybe much sooner than that
trump, They're very unhappy about that
trump, It's amazing
trump, We have a couple of really great experts, one who's … We call him Dr
trump, Scott
trump, You know who I'm talking about He's great
trump, He said, this is the only time … They were grilling him on television, saying, Well, the vaccine's going too fast
trump, You know why that's too fast Because they don't want it to happen before the election
trump, He said, This is the only thing in the world
trump, I've never seen anything like it
trump, Everybody wants a vaccine
trump, And when we start getting it fast, because President Trump happens to be president …  and we've done this in record time, years ahead of schedule
trump, If this was Sleepy Joe and Obama, you wouldn't have a vaccine for three years
trump, But listen, he said, This is the craziest thing
trump, So you're going to have a vaccine quickly
trump, Right And everybody's upset about it
trump, So now they're trying to hurt the vaccine
trump, And they're trying to say as many bad … They know nothing about it, but they're trying to hurt it, and it's a shame
trump, But he said it better than anybody I've heard
trump, He said, You're trying to hurt this country by saying bad things about the vaccine, because we're going to produce it early
trump, It's the craziest thing
trump, Think about it
trump, Now, having a vaccine is good, but we're rounding the turn regardless
trump, We're rounding the turn, and it's happening
trump, I mean, it's happening
trump, You see
trump, Florida is way down
trump, Texas is now way down
trump, Arizona, governor's done a great job
trump, All three governors have done a great job
trump, And Louisiana now, they had a spike, but they had the spike, but the spike was able to be handled, because now we understand
trump, And what we did, we saved millions of lives, because I hated to do it, but we had to close it up, understand this disease, and then open up again
trump, And we opened, but we would have had 2 million, two and a half, or three million people
trump, Think of it
trump, We're at like around 180,000
trump, One is too many
trump, One, too many
trump, But we would've had two and a half, three, three and a half million people
trump, It would not have been acceptable, would not have been sustainable
trump, We've done an incredible job
trump, And these people that have done it with me, the ventilators, the vaccines, the therapeutics, these people … I mean the hospitals, the beds that we built, the ships that we sent to New York, the ships that we sent
trump, To have an ungrateful governor in New York, Cuomo, to have an ungrateful governor
trump, We sent him ships
trump, We sent them ships
trump, We sent them
trump, We built a convention center with 2,800 beds, and he didn't use the beds for senior citizens
trump, He hardly used the beds at all
trump, He hardly used the ships at all
trump, He said we did a phenomenal job, and now he gets political
trump, He wants to get political with me
trump, A real wise guy, but that's okay
trump, You got to see what they are doing between him and de Blasio
trump, That's a beauty
trump, What they've done to my beautiful city
trump, I love that city so much
trump, What they've done is so horrible
trump, The highest taxes in the land, crime all over the place
trump, They're like 300 up in crime
trump, We need Rudy to come out of retirement
trump, But we're defeating the China virus
trump, When Biden was vice president, he was a complete disaster on the swine flu, which was a much easier thing to handle
trump, Joe Biden's own chief of staff said that when Biden managed swine flu in 2009, they quote, Did every possible thing wrong
trump, This is the guy that worked for him in charge of the swine flu
trump, And 60 million Americans got H1N1 in a period of time
trump, And it's just purely a … He said it was just … we were lucky
trump, He said, It's just lucky that there weren't great mass casualties
trump, Different kinds of a disease, a little bit
trump, And what he said is amazing
trump, He said we did nothing right
trump, This is the man that's going to tell us all about building ventilators
trump, You think Joe is going to be able to build thousands of ventilators a month Which now we're doing, and sending them to all these countries, all over the world, who have no hope of building ventilators, and they need them badly
trump, So it's an amazing thing
trump, The outbreak was so rampant that Obama-Biden, the administration, told States to stop testing immediately, and they ordered the CDC to stop counting cases because they looked like hell, okay We didn't do that
trump, By the way, the reason we show so many cases, because we have the best testing program in the world, by far, by far
trump, Biden's record demonstrates that if he had been in charge when the China virus arrived, hundreds of thousands of more Americans would have died
trump, As vice president, he presided over the worst and the weakest and the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression
trump, You've heard that before
trump, It was the most pathetic recovery since the Depression
trump, No state was hit harder by Biden's failure than Nevada
trump, And I was out here and that right about that
trump, You got hit hard
trump, This is not the guy you want
trump, But Biden wants to raise your taxes so high
trump, He would eradicate your economy
trump, He'd put on new regulations, and it wouldn't be him again
trump, I'm going to keep saying it
trump, It will be the people that control him
trump, He's a puppet
trump, And then he wants to do a complete shutdown
trump, We're setting records
trump, We just set a job record for four months, 10
trump,4 million people
trump, Listen to this
trump, So when we had this pandemic worldwide, look, it's a terrible thing that a thing like this happened
trump, People were saying we could go to 41, 42 unemployment
trump, You know what we are now 8
trump,4
trump, I don't say that's … If you would have said that … And we have the strongest, highest stock market in history, so your 401ks are doing great
trump, If he got in, we would have the greatest depression in the history of our country
trump, I mean it
trump, I think 1929 would look like good times
trump, All right Because he'd do everything wrong
trump, He'd raise your taxes
trump, He'd raised the hell out of interest rates
trump, He'd do everything wrong
trump, The Biden shutdown will permanently destroy the lives and dreams of tens of millions of Americans, inflict totally lasting harm on our children and lead countless deaths from suicide
trump, Don't forget when you do these shutdowns, your state is shut down
trump, You got a governor
trump, You shut down, except if you have a riot
trump, You're not shut down for riots
trump, Riots, you can have, they can burn the hell out of the Strip
trump, They can burn the hell out of Reno
trump, They can do whatever the hell they want if it's a riot
trump, But if you want to go to church, you can't do it
trump, If you want to be in a group of people, you can't do it
trump, But there's a lot of harm done on the other side
trump, There's a lot of tremendous harm done
trump, Remember, the cure can't be worse
trump, Remember that
trump, And on the other side, drugs, suicide, depression, substance abuse of different kinds, heart disease
trump, You have tremendous problems on the other side
trump, Open your schools, open up
trump, We got to open up this state
trump, And I guarantee you … And by the way, the states that are open are doing really well
trump, They're doing much better than the ones that are closed
trump, I don't know if you've been seeing the numbers
trump, And this is just arithmetic
trump, The states that are open are doing great
trump, The states that are closed, North Carolina, what he's doing to that great state, he's got it locked down, shut down
trump, Michigan, what she's doing
trump, And we're trying to get Big 10 football by the way, but we won't even
trump, Michigan, what she's doing to Michigan is unbelievable
trump, Take a look at what they're doing to Pennsylvania
trump, And here's another governor in charge of millions of ballots
trump, So I'm going to win Pennsylvania, but what's he going to do with these ballots Where are they going Who are they sending Who's sending it back Who's signing They don't even have to have an authorized signature in Nevada
trump, Do you know that They don't have to have … You don't have to have an authorized signature on a ballot No
trump, They're trying to rig an election, and we can't let that happen
trump, I hope you're all going to be poll-watchers, I hope you are, because with you people watching the polls, it's going to be pretty hard to cheat
trump, I'll tell you, I wouldn't want to be a cheater
trump, They'll figure a way
trump, No, they are
trump, It's a very dangerous thing
trump, It's a very dangerous thing, and I totally mean it
trump, And I've been at it
trump, And you see people
trump, And by the way, it's not even politics
trump, It's common sense
trump, They said millions of ballots
trump, People are getting ballots
trump, People died and they're getting ballots
trump, They're sending them to dogs
trump, You see that Dogs got ballot
trump, Everybody's getting ballots
trump, Probably everybody, but Republican are going to get the ballots
trump, Right And they're unsolicited
trump, So when you say, solicited, because I like solicited better as a word than absentee
trump, Absentee, nobody knows what the hell it's supposed to represent
trump, It's not really a good definition
trump, One is solicited, where you ask … You solicit the ballot
trump, You want it, you sign papers
trump, They send it to you
trump, You send it back
trump, It's okay
trump, It's good
trump, But unsolicited, where they take millions of ballots
trump, So what happens I happen to think the postal people are great, but what happens if one of the post guys, before he gives the ballots, he takes a whole handful and hands them to some Democrat political operative, right And so, he hands him a thousand ballots, and the guy doesn't even have to … you don't have to have verification to do that
trump, Now, here's the good news
trump, We're in front of a court
trump, And hopefully, the court's going to rule, because this is the greatest scam in the history of presidential politics
trump, These people are … they've gone crazy
trump, Biden and his party of liberal hypocrites want to lock law-abiding Americans in their homes, which is what they're doing
trump, And they want to keep them out of church
trump, They really do
trump, They're fighting God, they're fighting guns, and they're fighting oil
trump, Think of it
trump, I don't think they'll do too well in Texas
trump, Did you see where they said We think the race will be quite close in Texas, but the president has an edge
trump, Listen, I'm in favor of oil and energy
trump, I'm in favor of religion and God
trump, Okay And I'm in favor of our great Second Amendment, guns
trump, So he's against our Second Amendment
trump, Okay, you know who he'd put in charge
trump, Beto, Beto
trump, Or as he says is, Beto, Beto
trump, So when Beto was legit and then Ted Cruz beat him, and Ted did a very good job
trump, I tell you, he did a great job
trump, But Beto went totally south
trump, He's gone crazy
trump, So he now is a big gun guy
trump, He wants to take guns away from everybody
trump, So who did Biden put in charge Beto
trump, Remember Beto was interviewed in some magazine or third-rate magazine, most of them are, but remember And Beto said, this was at the beginning before he got beat to hell
trump, I said, He thought this was easy, didn't he But remember when Beto said, I was born for this
trump, As soon as I hear somebody's born for running for president, I said, He's out
trump, That's the end of him
trump, Nobody's born for this
trump, This is tough stuff
trump, I had a great life, I'll tell you
trump, My life was so beautiful
trump, What the hell did I do this for But you know what You know what We are doing things that nobody's ever done before
trump, And I say it all the time, and that's what makes me happy
trump, We're dealing with very sick and very bad and evil people
trump, But I'll tell you no administration in three-and-a-half years, no administration has done what we've done in the first three-and-a-half years
trump, But they want to punish you for praying in church while they let agitators and arsonists burn your churches down
trump, Look at Washington
trump, They want to burn the churches down, and that's fine
trump, But you want to go pray in church, they won't let you do that
trump, Just last week, Biden proudly accepted the endorsement of pro-criminal, anti-police, Portland district attorney, who has a policy of releasing rioters, vandals, criminals, and violent extremists without any charges
trump, No charges
trump, Never saw anything
trump, By the way, all of these places were talking about are Democrat- run, Chicago, New York, Portland, Seattle
trump, The only reason Seattle got settled, because they knew we were going in
trump, We told them, we're going in tomorrow morning
trump, We're going to open it up
trump, We're going to take it
trump, It would have taken us 20 minutes
trump, So they sent people that night, because they didn't want to be embarrassed
trump, But look at what we've done
trump, And so, every place we've touched, we solved the crime, but they have to ask us
trump, If they don't ask us, we're not supposed to do it, but maybe we do it anyway
trump, And it usually takes anywhere from 25 minutes to … And it usually takes anywhere from 25 minutes to about one hour
trump, Wasn't that a beautiful sight though in Minneapolis, right They're burning the poor city down
trump, I love that state
trump, I think we have a chance of winning in that state, first time in many years for a Republican
trump, They're burning Minneapolis
trump, You don't think of Minneapolis that way, right You don't think of it
trump, The city is burning down
trump, You have this fake CNN reporter, what's his name Velshi, the nice shaved head
trump, Maybe I should try that, should I try that No, I don't think …  Donald Trump went down substantially in the polls, like about 40
trump, He showed up with a new haircut, it's called the shave head
trump, Ali Velshi
trump, And remember he said, No, this is a friendly protest
trump, It's a friendly protest
trump, And it's really quite nice
trump, And people are throwing bottles at him, he's being hit with tear gas
trump, This is a friendly protest
trump, And you look over his shoulder and the entire city was burning
trump, Do you remember the scene The thing looked like it was 30 blocks, it was just burning
trump, And he's talking about, this is all fake news and nobody would have known
trump, I knew it before I did it, but I never knew it to this extent
trump, I never knew it to this extent
trump, It is corrupt
trump, It's fake and they shouldn't be allowed to do it
trump, They shouldn't be allowed
trump, These are far left lunatics that Biden selects to staff his government
trump, There are policies Biden's pledged to apply nationwide
trump, You're going to have the suburbs, they have a plan
trump, It doesn't matter, it's a regulation, very horrible regulation for the … Does anybody live in the suburbs Because if you don't vote for Trump in the suburbs, okay
trump, Women that live in the suburbs
trump, They say, Oh, they don't like Donald Trump
trump, I said, I think they do
trump, Remember last time, remember it's the same thing
trump, No, it's the same thing
trump, Remember, last time, four years ago, Donald Trump will not do well with women
trump, I said, Why am I so bad Donald Trump will not … And then the votes started coming in
trump, He's doing very well, Jim, with women, I don't know what's going on
trump, We did very well with women
trump, We did well with everybody, we did well with everybody
trump, But they have a regulation
trump, And Ben Carson was fantastic, the head of HUD
trump, I said, Ben, they're going to destroy the suburbs
trump, And they wanted Corey Booker to head that program
trump, But the program was already doing damage
trump, They were playing with the zoning so they could build projects in the suburb, projects in the suburbs
trump, And I said, We're going to end it
trump, Somebody said, Sir, let's just amend it
trump, I said, Nope, we got to end it
trump, End it, I want to end it
trump, I don't want to have a lesser version
trump, But if he gets in, they will open up that whole program
trump, They're going to open it up on steroids
trump, They're going to open it up to a level that you wouldn't have believed possible
trump, And he will drive you out of the suburbs
trump, He will drive you out of the … he'll drive you out of everything
trump, They're open up their … I call it the suburban destruction program because that's what they've done
trump, And it's been a horrible program
trump, It's been very unfair to people with the American dream
trump, And let me just tell you something
trump, 30 of the people that live in the suburbs are minorities
trump, They're Hispanic, they're Black, they're Asian, it's the American dream
trump, And they want the American dream and they don't want that to happen
trump, That's why I'm doing so well with African American, with Asian American, with Hispanic American and with women
trump, But don't let them ruin the suburbs because they will put that regulation back immediately, immediately
trump, And don't let them ruin the suburbs because the suburbs are a special place
trump, The suburbs are the American dream
trump, That's where everyone aspires to and that includes minorities and everybody
trump, Don't let them ruin the suburbs
trump, And with that comes tremendous crime
trump, And I was talking the other day, Darling, somebody just moved next door
trump, Who is it It's a representative of Antifa
trump, She will look at her husband, say, Darling, we're out of here
trump, We're out of here
trump, Antifa
trump, Remember they were trying to blame other people
trump, They don't like to mention the name Antifa
trump, I said, it's Antifa and I was right
trump, I was right
trump, They're bad people
trump, And you know what, they have to pay a price for the damage and for the horror that they've caused, they have to pay a price
trump, And it's so easy
trump, It's so easy
trump, A lot of them now are wealthy
trump, They're like these wealthy, spoiled kids that have no clue about life
trump, They've got arms that are about this big but they were heavy jackets with lots … and you look and you say, Oh, that guy looks tough
trump, And then the jacket comes off and you see these two little … And they go home and they live in a basement too, their mom and dad's basement
trump, But Biden's plan is to appease domestic terrorists and my plan is to arrest domestic terrorists
trump, Joe Biden is a weak person
trump, He does whatever his left wing, puppet masters demand, you know that
trump, Look, Joe doesn't know what's going on, you know that
trump, I mean, let's be nice about it, okay
trump, And I'm being nice when I say it
trump, He'll never be able to protect your family, your loved ones or your community
trump, If Biden's elected his radical supporters won't just cause mayhem on the streets like you're seeing, all Democrats
trump, We could solve it so fast
trump, Chicago, a few weekends, think of it, 72 people shot, this is shot
trump, Somebody said, You mean with bullets I said, Yeah, with bullets
trump, 18 people died
trump, Now we're pulling our troops out of Afghanistan, out of Iraq, you see what's happening
trump, But let me tell you but we don't … there's nothing like that over there
trump, They don't have 18 people killed or 12 people in a short period of time
trump, Well, you have 70 people shot, where you have another weekend where they had, I think a few weekends ago, 38 people have been shot in Chicago
trump, I said, 38 It's not even believable
trump, And now when these people say it, they make it … they try and play it down
trump, And you're sitting there, I said, Did I just see 38 people were shot It's just a terrible thing
trump, And it could all be stopped
trump, It could all be stopped so quickly
trump, But they have to respect law and they have to have order
trump, Law and order
trump, But these radical lefts will be running the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security and the United States Supreme Court
trump, And you see what's going on there
trump, If we don't … The next president, hopefully it's going to be us, not me, us, but the next president is going to have one, two, three or four Supreme Court justice
trump, It's just, you know, just that time, right Just that time, going to be a minimum of one, I would say, but it will be a one, two, three or four
trump, And that's going to change the whole makeup of the Supreme Court
trump, That's going to take away your guns
trump, That's going to destroy your second amendment
trump, That's going to change the whole rationale thinking on so many different subjects like you wouldn't believe, including by the way, life, okay
trump, Life, pro-life, anybody pro-life here No, this is going to change the makeup of this country for 50 years
trump, I don't know that the country will survive 50 years, if that happens, it might not survive five years if that happens
trump, But the next president and you saw, I put out a list of an additional number of very conservative, highly thought of, highly respected judges
trump, And they are the only people that I will pick
trump, Meaning the first list, the second list, it's about 44, 45 people
trump, They are the only people that I will consider for the Supreme Court of the United States
trump, And I'm asking Joe Biden to do the same thing, but he can't because he's got a bunch of radical left maniacs that they want to put on the court
trump, And nobody can get elected, not even with Democrats, rational Democrats, will they vote for some of these people to be on
trump, So far he's refused to do it
trump, I'm probably forcing him tonight to do something, but he should put out a list of his judges so that you know where you stand
trump, Biden supports cutting police funding, you know that, abolishing … and by the way, did you see, we just got Chicago police today endorsed Trump
trump, That's not easy to do
trump, Chicago
trump, New York's finest, New York's finest endorse, Florida, Ohio, Texas
trump, We have everybody
trump, Is there a police officer in the country, if there is, they'll do a commercial
trump, This officer loves sleepy Joe Biden, he's so tough on crime
trump, So Biden's been going down very rapidly in the polls
trump, And now what he's doing is he's playing tough guy, that he's tough on crime
trump, And all of a sudden, he goes from demolished, demolish and defund, okay But he goes from, let's not give the police any money
trump, Let's not even say defund for him
trump, His people want to defund the police
trump, They actually have places, Seattle, they actually don't want to have police
trump, Minneapolis, they don't want to have police
trump, They don't want to have police
trump, What's going to happen You saw the commercial we put up
trump, A woman's being murdered
trump, I'm sorry
trump, We cannot take your call right now
trump, We will call you back within the next 24 hours
trump, A woman's being raped, right I'm sorry
trump, We could not respond right now because we have been defunded, but we will try getting there within the next week
trump, This is what you're going to have
trump, I mean, that was a strong commercial
trump, It had a big impact, but this is what you're buying with a guy like this
trump, This guy you're going to have Portland's all over this country
trump, And we can't allow that to happen
trump, Not here, he says, Not here in Nevada
trump, Well with your governor, it could happen here too, I can tell
trump, They want to abolish bail
trump, So they want to abolish cash bail like they did in New York
trump, They release people, the horrible criminals in New York, they release them, no cash bail
trump, And he calls law enforcement, Biden called law enforcement the enemy
trump, They're not the enemy
trump, They're our friends
trump, They're our great friends
trump, And without them, we wouldn't be here
trump, Here in Nevada rioters burned the city hall in Reno
trump, Does anybody know that Do you know that That's not a pleasant sight
trump, How did you allow that to happen I would've thought you people would've gotten out there, like, You're not going to burn our city hall
trump, And during the violent demonstrations in Las Vegas a 29- year-old police officer, you know about this, was deliberately shot in the head while he was doing his job, a vicious criminal left, he was a left person, a left
trump, He was a real left, all right
trump, And the, the young officer as you know, he's a young, brilliant, young guy and he's totally paralyzed
trump, Unlike Biden, while I'm President of the United States, I will always stand with the heroes of our law enforcement
trump, And on November 3rd, you will save America
trump, You're talking about saving America
trump, We cannot let this happen to our country
trump, Because I don't know if you can ever come back from what will happen, including our Supreme Court
trump, We're joined tonight by our terrific Republican congressional nominee, who has my complete and total endorsement
trump, Jim, where you Jim Jim Marchant, Jim Marchant, where are you A lot of people out there, Jim, it's not easy
trump, Are you doing well I just looked at a very solid poll
trump, Jim Marchant is a great guy and hopefully he's going to win and you're going to carry them over and you need it, you need it
trump, Thank you, Jim
trump, And also to a man that should have been governor
trump, He should have been governor, what happened I don't know what happened
trump, Nevada Attorney General, he's a great guy, Adam Laxalt
trump, And he's watching very closely
trump, And I'll tell you, Adam, please, he's a great lawyer, a great talent
trump, And he's going places but you have to watch
trump, He just said, our next governor
trump, I believe that's true
trump, You have my endorsement, but I will tell you this, Adam, if you could, because you're doing a fantastic job watching, watch all these votes coming in on the ballots, the unsolicited ballots
trump, Will you watch it, please Okay, all right
trump, All right, James Settelmeyer
trump, Where's James James, look at James, whoa
trump, Look at the size of James, I want you protecting me, James
trump, James is good

trump, I think we're all doing well
trump, I think we're all doing well, it's like a family
trump, Thank you James very much
trump, All of you guys, thank you very much
trump, A woman who did a fantastic job, she headed up Michigan
trump, We won Michigan, the first time in decades, Republicans won
trump, She was horrendous, she kept calling me, Sir, one more speech, please come over
trump, Okay, I'll do one more, Ronna, Ronna McDaniel
trump, I'll do one more, Ronna, one more
trump, I do the speech, two days later, I get a call
trump, One more, sir
trump, We need one more
trump, But we ended up winning Michigan, first time in decades
trump, Ronna McDaniel, Ronna
trump, She was great
trump, And I said when I won, I said, Well, who are we going to put at the RNC That's Republican National Committee, who we're going to put And I said,  How about that woman that ran … She was so tough
trump, I said, How about the woman that ran Michigan that we won, first time in so many years So thank you, Ronna, great job you're doing, we appreciate it
trump, And another man is doing a fantastic job, who's been a friend of mine for a long time, your GOP chair, Michael McDonald
trump, Michael, great job, Michael
trump, Thank you, Michael
trump, Thank you, Mike
trump, How are we doing, Michael Are we leading, I hope Okay
trump, I hear we're doing well
trump, Be careful of the ballots, that's the only way we're going to lose
trump, Can't have this happen to our country
trump, And also here are several really great members of a terrific association and they like Trump a lot, the Nevada Trucking Association
trump, Where are they, Nevada Trucking Nevada Trucking, thank you, thank you
trump, Thank you, fellas, thank you very much
trump, Great job, we appreciate it very much
trump, Those roads are going to get very nice
trump, They're already starting
trump, Tonight our hearts are with all of the communities in the West battling devastating wildfires
trump, I'm going there the day after tomorrow
trump, I'm staying in your state tonight, but I'm going to be going to California
trump, Spoke to the folks in Oregon, Washington, they never had anything like this, but it is about forest management
trump, Please remember the words, very simple, forest management, please remember
trump, It's about forest management and other things but forest management
trump, My administration is closely coordinating with state and local leaders and we want to thank the more than 200,000 people that are working on it and 28,000 firefighters and first responders who courageously and bravely are fighting out there
trump, They are fighting and it's dangerous, it's dangerous
trump, It's rapidly spreading, hundreds of thousands of acres, it's not been anything quite like this one
trump, We spent the last four years reversing the horrible damage Joe Biden inflicted over the past 47 years
trump, Think of it, he's been there 47 years
trump, And he always says, Well, why didn't you do this Why did … The guy just really in all fairness, I've been here three and a half years
trump, So it's not like they haven't been here
trump, He was a vice president for eight years and he only did one thing good
trump, He treated Obama good
trump, I was going to say something else, but they would have scolded me
trump, That's exactly what I was going to say, but I didn't
trump, It's better than you say it
trump, Do you want to shout it out Go ahead, shout
trump, That's what I said, that's what I was … thank you very … This can only happen in Nevada
trump, And we pass record tax cuts and regulation cuts to keep the family farms and ranches in the family
trump, Nobody even knows this
trump, We virtually eliminated the unfair estate tax, also known as the death tax
trump, Does anyone have a small farm, medium-sized farm or business Anybody If you want to leave it to your children, you don't have to pay tax now because of Trump
trump, I always say it and I mean it, if you like your children, it's great
trump, If you don't like your children, it doesn't mean a damn thing, don't leave it to them
trump, I ended the administrations … and if you look at that last administration, what they were doing on American energy, what they were doing, and now we are the world's number one energy producer by far and we are energy independent
trump, How about your gas prices That's not too bad, right You didn't think you'd ever see those prices, those under two dollar prices, did you Thank you President Trump, I appreciate it, sir
trump, Biden has pledged to abolish the production of American oil and shale and clean coal and natural gas, and he wants to ban fracking, right So he's in these debates with the other people and they're just eating him alive
trump, He did his best debate against crazy Bernie and I got to ask, why did he get better, all of a sudden What happened Why, do you have any idea why I think I know
trump, Why did he get better all of a sudden But he did his last event, but he was so bad
trump, And he raised his hand, no fracking
trump, There will be no fracking under my administration, he said
trump, And you know why I add the word, he said, because they will take what I said and they will put it as a commercial
trump, There will be no fracking under my administration, they'll have me saying that
trump, That's how dishonest these people are
trump, So I always have to add something because … but even then sometimes they'll cut it off at the end
trump, But he said, there'll be no fracking under my administration
trump, Now, all of a sudden he goes to Pennsylvania and his polls aren't looking very good because they do big fracking
trump, And he goes to Texas and he goes to Oklahoma and he goes to North Dakota and he goes to all these places
trump, It's not looking so good
trump, All of a sudden he says, I have nothing against fracking
trump, What are you talking about But always follow their first instinct because the first instinct is what is going to happen
trump, And he has to, because he signed … he has a manifesto
trump, I call it the manifesto with Bernie and AOC plus three, all these crazy people
trump, And it's a manifesto and it reads far worse than anything Bernie Sanders ever said
trump, I thought he'd take what Bernie did and move them somewhat to the right
trump, No, he took what Bernie said and they moved way further left
trump, It's the craziest thing I've ever seen
trump, But follow the original statements because that's what's going to happen
trump, And they cannot … you know solar, I like solar, but solar is very expensive and it doesn't have the power to fire up our massive plants
trump, We have big plants, including in this great state and you can't fire them up with this stuff
trump, You can't fire it
trump, We need the strength because we're competing against a lot of nations and they don't go through what we do
trump, They don't care about the air and they should, and they should, which is another problem
trump, I took you out of that crazy Paris Climate Accord, because it was totally disaster
trump, No, it was a way of hurting the United States
trump, I tell you, we would have had a close 20, 25 of our factories in order to even … it was so crazy, so expensive but I took you out
trump, I was surprised people, most people, they appreciate what I did
trump, Because you think it was easy doing that It was actually, I thought it would be devastating
trump, I got one day of bad press, after that, everybody forgot about it
trump, It wasn't that bad
trump, But I did the right thing for our country and we want to have our great plants working
trump, We want to have our great plants fired up
trump, They said manufacturing jobs are dead, right Sleepy Joe said, I'm going to bring back manufacturing
trump, Really Well, Obama said, you'd need a miracle to bring back manufacturing
trump, I brought back 650,000 jobs
trump, He said you'd need a miracle
trump, And now sleepy Joe is saying that, no, no, no
trump, I've got to bring back … He's not going to bring back anything
trump, I made history by signing an executive order making the official policy of the United States government to buy American and to hire American
trump, Now I did this long time ago
trump, And then I see a sign in front of Joe right here, right here, it said, buy American
trump, Oh great, Joe, thanks, Joe
trump, Where have you been for 47 years Because for 47 years, Joe Biden did the opposite
trump, He crushed the dreams of American workers and enriched foreign countries
trump, That's how China happened
trump, Hey, look what I've done
trump, I've taken billions, tens of billions of dollars out of China
trump, Nobody else did it before me, I mean, no other president
trump, In all fairness, in all fairness to Obama and Biden, I call him, Obiden because it's easier, Obiden
trump, In all fairness to Obiden, I mean, they didn't do any of that
trump, But now I see buy American
trump, Hey, he also copied on the pandemic
trump, Did you see he copied everything I was doing Except one thing, he wouldn't have closed the country to China so hundreds of thousands of people would have died from that
trump, But two months, two and a half months later, he admitted that I was right
trump, Thank you very much, Joe, I appreciate it
trump, And yesterday he made, I think he made a mistake
trump, Well, what do you think, the USMCA, what's better that or NAFTA Well, no, the USMCA is better
trump, Was that Jake Tapper I like Jake Tapper, was that … I don't think he was doing … I don't think he likes me too much, but that's okay
trump, They said what's better, they said, what's better
trump, He goes, USMCA
trump, Well, that's the deal that Trump made
trump, Oh, it is Oh
trump, That's a great deal we made
trump, We took the horrible NAFTA deal
trump, We got rid of the NAFTA
trump, We got rid of TPP
trump, We got rid of that terrible, terrible South Korea deal, which Hillary Clinton said, will produce 250,000 jobs
trump, She said, this will produce 200 … she made it
trump, Hillary, crooked Hillary
trump, She made it, no wait, she said it's going to produce 250,000 jobs
trump, And she was 100 right, it produced 250,000 jobs for South Korea, not for us
trump, It produced 250,000 jobs for South Korea
trump, Not for us
trump, South Korea did very well with that deal, but I changed that deal a lot
trump, That's now a good deal
trump, Earlier this year, I kept my promise to American workers
trump, When we ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand new USMCA Mexico-Canada Agreement into law
trump, You're not going to see companies leaving for Mexico very much anymore
trump, They're not going to be leaving your community, going to Mexico, making a product, selling the product back in, not being taxed at the border
trump, Doesn't work that way anymore
trump, It's probably the biggest reason I ran for president if you want to know that… and these stupid, endless wars
trump, I saved the Uni-… but that's one of the reasons Washington doesn't like me
trump, They love those endless wars
trump, You got to ask them, Why Do you ever watch where they're very critical of me
trump, I mean, We don't like him on foreign policy
trump, Really Look what I've done
trump, Look what I've done
trump, Israel… We're signing deals all over the place
trump, These guys that are lecturing all the time, they don't have a clue
trump, They're clueless
trump, They were clueless
trump, That's why for 40 years you got nothing except blood in the sand
trump, That's all you got
trump, Blood in the sand
trump, I saved the US auto industry by withdrawing from last administration's job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership
trump, I took the toughest ever action to stand up to China's rampant theft of American jobs
trump, They don't like me too much
trump, Joe Biden's agenda is, Made in China
trump, My agenda is, Made in the USA
trump, That's the way
trump, For the last four years, I've been delivering for our incredible Hispanic… I love a Hispanic community
trump, Oh, there was a poll today
trump, Did you see it Did you see the poll Oh, this was a biggie
trump, They had a poll today that with the Hispanic voter, they call them Latino, Hispanic
trump, They use different terms
trump, To me, I just loved the people
trump, I don't care, but let me just… Did you see it Trump is leading Biden with the Hispanic community
trump, Trump is leading Biden
trump, Well, Hispanics like tough people
trump, They like people that are going to produce jobs
trump, They like… And by the way, the Hispanics understand the border better than anybody else
trump, They're better than anybody else
trump, No, but we're being… you know, it's unusual that a Republican would be leading a Democrat, not… it's habit
trump, You know what the problem is, it's habit
trump, But the Hispanics get it
trump, And we're leading with the Hispanic community
trump, And that's because you had the lowest job numbers in the history of our country
trump, You had the best home ownership
trump, Every statistic was the best
trump, And now we're doing it again, except we're doing it very rapidly
trump, Remember 8
trump,4
trump, We could have been at 44, if stupid people ran it, 8
trump,4
trump, I'm fighting for school choice, safe neighborhoods, low taxes and regulations on Hispanic-owned, small businesses
trump, We're fighting
trump, You know, the Hispanic-owned, small businesses, they're great business people
trump, I know it from being in business
trump, They were very tough
trump, They were great business people and they get it
trump, They get it like very few people get it
trump, I'm also standing up for religious liberty
trump, Joe Biden would be… So Joe Biden would be a disaster for all communities, not just the Hispanic communities, pledged to wage attacks on Catholic organizations, like the Little Sisters of the Poor that we're helping
trump, And we're winning with them
trump, We're helping them
trump, They got hit so hard by Oh Biden
trump, They got hit so hard
trump, I remember them in the Supreme Court, the Little Sisters of the Poor
trump, They get hit by Biden
trump, And then he says, How wonderful
trump, He's such a wonderful person
trump, He supports taxpayer-funded, extreme, late-term abortion
trump, And I mean, ninth month, ninth month, ninth month
trump, And he'd allow violent mobs to burn down your business
trump, And he would hand your country over to the socialists
trump, But I believe it's worse than socialists
trump, I do
trump, I think it's a step worse than socialist
trump, And it starts with a C
trump, That is why we're going to win a record share of the Hispanic vote in November
trump, So important
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you
trump, It's so important
trump, We're bringing it back very fast
trump, I think next year is… Next year, I believe will be as good or better than the year we had last year
trump, Unless somebody comes in and decides to quadruple your taxes, then I can't
trump, Then all bets are off, but we're going to have… We're lowering taxes
trump, He's raising taxes
trump, We're going to have tremendous growth
trump, Joe Biden's party continues to attack our incredible border agents
trump, They're incredible people, more than half of whom happen to be Hispanic-Americans
trump, Did you know that I know all of them
trump, Jose, how you doing Juan, how you doing Every sixth time, I'd say, Hello, Jim, how are you These extraordinary patriots deserve our admiration, gratitude and respect, not Joe Biden's contempt
trump, He's got contempt for these people that are so great and brave
trump, That's a tough job
trump, My administration's achieved the most secure border in American history
trump, We ended the catch and release disaster
trump, Remember you'd catch somebody, What's your name I don't know
trump, What's your address I don't know
trump, Okay
trump, Go into our country
trump, That's okay
trump, You couldn't arrest anybody
trump, We ended it, stopped asylum fraud and we've deported over 20,000 gang members, including MS13 and over a half a million criminal illegal aliens
trump, Now think about it
trump, Think of that number
trump, Think if you at a half a million people spread throughout the country that were criminal, illegal aliens
trump, Some of these are very violent people and we get them the hell out
trump, We're stopping human trafficking, protecting the victims, most of whom are women, most of whom are women
trump, Human trafficking because of the internet that's a tremendously big and horrible business
trump, These are the worst human beings of all
trump, But most of the victims are women, children to a much lesser extent, but women and human traffickers
trump, And you know what made it that way is the internet
trump, Who would think It almost sounds like an ancient crime
trump, It's not
trump, It's very modern because of the internet because of the computer
trump, And it's a horrible thing and we've stopped so much of it
trump, We have an incredible group of people that go after these animals
trump, And we built now over 320 miles of border wall and are adding 10 new miles a week
trump, And the wall will very soon be finished
trump, It'll be finished
trump, We've invested 2
trump,5 trillion in the US military
trump, We've rebuilt our depleted… It was a depleted military
trump, Now we have the newest, we have the best we've ever had and launched the first new branch of the United States Armed Forces in nearly 75 years, the US Space Force
trump, And we did things that people said couldn't be done
trump, After 52 years, we passed VA Choice in VA Accountability and 91 of our veterans now approve of their VA care
trump, They think it's doing great
trump, The fact is I did more in 47 months as president than Joe Biden did in 47 years
trump, It's true
trump, It's true
trump, I withdrew from last administration's disastrous Iran nuclear deal
trump, We killed the founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi
trump, We eliminated the world's number one terrorist and mass murderer of American troops, Qasem Soleimani
trump, He's dead
trump, He's gone
trump, Biden voted for the Iraq War
trump, He opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden
trump, He opposed killing Soleimani
trump, He oversaw the rise of ISIS and he cheered the rise of China as a very positive development
trump, Oh, really Tell me about it
trump, Tell me about it
trump, Not too positive
trump, Joe Biden has been on the wrong side of history for 47 years
trump, In fact, the secretary of state, secretary of defense said about him, He's never called it right
trump, He never called it right
trump, If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would right now have died
trump, When the virus arrived, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II
trump, You know that, especially with ventilators and equipment and masks and shields
trump, We're delivering life-saving therapies that have achieved among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country in the world
trump, And you don't hear that from the fake news
trump, Europe's excess mortality rate is 24 higher
trump, And these are statistics that come from people that do this stuff, right This is not done by my secretary
trump, 24 higher than the United States and despite their punitive lockdowns, they're once again seeing a spike
trump, They're seeing a big spike in cases over there
trump, They did the heavy lockdowns, just like you're doing right here
trump, And they're seeing a spike
trump, And there's no reason for that
trump, The United States has experienced the smallest contraction of any major Western nation
trump, Think of that
trump, And by far, the fastest recovery
trump, And if they wrote about it properly, it would be a proper thing, a proper thing to do
trump, Through our historic relief programs, we've saved more than half a trillion Nevada cops and jobs and all of this yet
trump, So many people going out
trump, We've saved 42,000 Nevada businesses
trump, Think of that
trump, Biden would terminate this comeback
trump, He wants to end it
trump, He would terminate this comeback
trump, He would put your families in danger
trump, He will totally destroy Social Security
trump, And in my opinion, if you look at what he's going to do to Medicare, they will destroy Social Security
trump, They will
trump, You called it
trump, You know what you're talking about Exactly, right
trump, He's going to massively raise your taxes
trump, Reimpose crippling federal regulations, destroy your Social Security and destroy protections for pre-existing conditions
trump, He's going to destroy that and decimate your 401ks and retirement savings and stocks
trump, Your stocks are going to go down like you never saw anything go down before
trump, He'll obliterate your Second Amendment
trump, He'll give you… And he would, he would give free… He wants to give free healthcare to illegal aliens that will bankrupt Medicare
trump, He wants to give… You saw him raise his hand
trump, Remember the debate where they're all standing there and he looked around, Who's going to give free healthcare to illegal aliens And everyone's raising hands
trump, He's going, Oh… Now take a look
trump, I'm not kidding
trump, It's sad
trump, It's pathetic
trump, He would end our travel bans on jihadist regions and increase refugee admissions 700, opening the flood gates to terror-afflicted nations
trump, You understand that
trump, He'll establish a national sanctuary city policy for criminal, illegal aliens
trump, He loves sanctuary cities, meaning the people that control him love sanctuary cities
trump, Biden, pledges to oppose school choice
trump, And he has stated that if he is elected charter schools are gone
trump, They're gone
trump, In the second term, and we've already started it very heavily, I will provide school choice to every parent in America
trump, A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs and a limitless future for all Americans
trump, Instead of letting Washington change us, despite all that we've been through and we've been through more than any president has ever been through with these characters and they're falling one after another
trump, But you do notice that I hope
trump, One after another
trump, Oh, I see the phones have been wiped out
trump, I wonder what that's all about, but that's a criminal thing you did
trump, We are changing Washington
trump, We are changing Washington
trump, Never forget that they're coming after me because I am fighting for you
trump, And it's true
trump, Over the next four years to conclude, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world
trump, And we will end our reliance on China once and for all
trump, We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States
trump, We will rapidly return to full employment, soaring economies and a record prosperity, even greater than last year
trump, We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, surge federal prosecutors into high crime communities and ban sanctuary cities
trump, We will appoint prosecutors, judges, justices, and believe… We will believe in enforcing the law
trump, We want law and order
trump, We have to have it
trump, We will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed
trump, We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life
trump, We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms
trump, We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of endless foreign wars
trump, And we are bringing our troops home as we speak tonight
trump, We will maintain America's unrivaled military might and we will ensure peace through strength
trump, We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency
trump, It's already signed, starts on January 1st
trump, I don't want anyone to… I know ours is a big deal
trump, I don't want Sleepy Joe to take care of… Can you imagine I'll be watching
trump, Prices have dropped substantially all throughout the country because of price… And I'm the one that got it done
trump, And he'll say, What did I do What did I do How did this happen And we'll further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs
trump, We just did favored nations
trump, We're going to come down to the lowest price anywhere in the world because we did a favored nations clause
trump, You know what that is We will… The drug companies don't exactly like me too much
trump, They're spending millions of dollars on negative commercials
trump, Please understand when you see those commercials, it means your drug prices are coming down
trump, We will strongly protect Medicaid and Social Security, which they will give up
trump, And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions and America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars
trump, We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools
trump, And we will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag
trump, And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God We Trust
trump, For years, you had a president who apologized for America
trump, Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the people of Nevada
trump, So very importantly, get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers and get out and vote on November 3rd
trump, From Carson City to Elko, from Las Vegas to Reno and from Clark County to right here in Douglas County, we stand on the shoulders of red-blooded American patriots who poured out their heart, sweat, and soul to secure our liberty
trump, They want to secure our liberty
trump, Think of it and defend our freedom
trump, Nevada was founded by pioneers and prospectors, miners and cowboys, innovators and trailblazers, tough people, great people who tamed the frontier, raised up the mighty Hoover Dam, lit up the brilliant lights of the Vegas Strip and transformed a sprawling desert into a shining oasis
trump, So true
trump, Our American ancestors made this into the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth
trump, And we are making it greater than it ever has been
trump, We are making it greater than ever before
trump, We are making it greater than it's ever been
trump, Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country
trump, We are returning power to you, the American people
trump, With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working
trump, We're going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning
trump, We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God
trump, And together with the incredible people of Nevada, we will make America wealthy again
trump, We will make America strong again
trump, We will make America proud again
trump, We will make America safe again and we will make America great again
trump, Thank you very much
trump,
trump,Thank you very much
trump, Thank you, Minnesota
trump, This is a great state
trump, We are going to win this state in a very short period of time
trump, Thank you
trump, This feels like the day before the election
trump, So we have 20,000-plus people inside
trump, We just set a new record
trump, And we have 25,000 people that we still love, outside
trump, And close to 100,000 people wanted to come tonight
trump, Thank you all
trump, This is great
trump, This is really great
trump, Thank you
trump, I want to thank our great vice president, Mike Pence, and Karen Pence, for being here tonight
trump, It is great to be back in the Twin Cities with the freedom-loving American patriots who make our country run
trump, You know that
trump, You know it
trump, For the next 13 months, think of that, it seems like yesterday, for the next 13 months, we are going to fight with all of our heart and soul, and we are going to win the great state of Minnesota in 2020
trump, America now has the number one economy anywhere in the world, and it's not even close
trump, You know I'm dealing with China right now
trump, They're in Washington
trump, We're going to see if we make a deal
trump, But they want to make it
trump, We're going to determine whether or not we want to make it
trump, But they've been very nice
trump, And today I got a call from one of the top representatives, he said, Congratulations, Mr
trump, President, on having a truly great, great economy
trump, That's pretty nice
trump, We picked up, since the election, trillions of dollars in value
trump, And China has lost trillions of dollars in value
trump, I will say this, if our opponent had won that election, you know what would have happened Right now China would become the … It would be the number one economy anywhere in the world
trump, And right now I can tell you they're not even close
trump, Our country is stronger than ever before because we are proudly putting, for the first time in a long time, we are putting America first
trump,  cops love Trump, Trump loves cops
trump, Our bold pursuit of this pro-American agenda has enraged, and you know what's happened, it's enraged the failed ruling class in Washington
trump, Not easy to get them out, but we're doing it slowly, but surely
trump, These corrupt politicians and the radical leftists got rich bleeding America dry
trump, And they knew that my election would finally end their pillaging and looting of our country
trump, And that's what they were doing
trump, And that's what they continue to try and do
trump, That is why, from day one, the wretched Washington swamp has been trying to nullify the results of a truly great and democratic election, the election of 2016
trump, They're trying
trump, They're not getting very far
trump, They want to erase your vote like it never existed
trump, They want to erase your voice
trump, And they want to erase your future
trump, But they will fail, because in America, the people rule again
trump, Do you remember that, just 19 minutes after I raised my hand and took the oath of office, The Washington Post, a terrible newspaper that doesn't know how to write the truth, published a story, and in this case, they might've gotten it pretty correct, they said, The Campaign To Impeach President Trump Has Begun
trump, That was the headline
trump, Little did we know they weren't playing games
trump, Think of that
trump, That was 19 minutes after the oath of office
trump, Months earlier, Peter Strzok, remember, he and his lover, Lisa Page
trump, What a group
trump, She's going to win 10 million to one
trump, She's going to win
trump, I'm telling you, Peter
trump, I'm telling you, Peter, she's going to win
trump, Peter
trump, Oh, I love you so much
trump, I love you, Peter
trump, I love you too, Lisa
trump, Lisa, I love you
trump, Lisa, Lisa, oh God, I love you, Lisa
trump, And if she doesn't win, Lisa, we've got an insurance policy, Lisa
trump, We'll get that son of a bitch out
trump, We got an insurance policy
trump, And we're living through the insurance policy
trump, That's what it is
trump, The phony Russia hoax
trump,  Lisa, I love you
trump, Now the do-nothing Democrat con artists and scammers are getting desperate
trump, 13 months, they got to move fast, because they're not beating us at the polls and they know it, despite the phony polls that you see all the time, their phony polls
trump, You know, polls are no different
trump, Remember I always used to talk about polls, I know polls very well
trump, Polls are no different than crooked writers
trump, They're crooked polls
trump, They're crooked polls
trump, No different
trump, Boy, that's a lot of media
trump, Look back there
trump, That's a lot of media
trump, They are so dishonest
trump, And frankly, they are so bad for our country
trump, They are so bad
trump, And they could be so good for our country
trump, They could be so good
trump, And maybe they'll change, and maybe they won't
trump, I've been waiting for a long time
trump, After I won the last election, I said, Finally it's okay
trump, Finally I'll get some great press
trump, They got worse
trump, They got worse
trump, I said, Finally, we're going to get … I said to the first lady, Darling, we're going to finally get respect
trump, We're going to finally get media and press coverage
trump, It's going to be great
trump, Look at what we've done
trump, And I'm telling you, they did, they got worse
trump, They know they cannot win
trump, You understand
trump, Well, if you didn't understand, honestly, there's no way anybody could win, because you'd believe them
trump, If you believe them, there's no way anybody could … Because it's like 94 … I can do the greatest things in history, and they'll make them bad to very bad
trump, And if I do a neutral, something neutral, it worked out okay, not great, it's like, Give him the electric chair
trump, That was terrible
trump, Right No, this is the worst
trump, These people and the Democrats, they're partners
trump, It's a partnership
trump, How about on the newscast, like the word manufactured, it's manu… And every newscast, Tonight, in a manufactured deal along the border … The word's never been used … All of a sudden every newscast is using it
trump, It's a talking point given to these fakers by the Democrats
trump, So they know they can't win the 2020 election, so they're pursuing the insane impeachment witch hunt
trump, I've been going through it now for more time than I've been in office
trump, Because, like Strzok with his insurance deal, this was before, remember this, this was before, that statement was made months before I took office
trump, That statement was made months before the election took place
trump, They said, Just in case, we're going to have an insurance policy
trump, That only means one thing, We're going to get him out
trump, So they're telling us
trump, We can't let that ever happen again to another president
trump, And Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, a lot of people, the great Mark Levin
trump, We have a lot of great people
trump, Lou Dobbs, great people
trump, You know what they said Every one of them, plus many others, There's no other man that we've ever met that could have taken it
trump, It's true
trump, Maybe I'm a little different up here
trump, I don't know
trump, But I enjoy it
trump, To me, I'm energized because we're draining the swamp
trump, The Democrats' brazen attempt to overthrow our government will produce a backlash at the ballot box the likes of which they have never ever seen before in the history of this country
trump, These are bad people
trump, My phone call, as an example, with the president of Ukraine, was perfect
trump, Everybody that looked at it
trump, And the only reason I released it was that the Democrats put out a phony narrative
trump, So I had no choice
trump, And I don't want to do that as president, every time a president from a country calls me, or I call them, we have to release the text
trump, How can you do business that way Who's going to want to speak to your president So the president of Ukraine reiterated today at a major news conference, on other subjects, that he was under absolutely no pressure
trump, He doesn't even know what they're talking about
trump, And he used the word, there was no blackmail during this call
trump, He used that term
trump, So in theory, that should be the end of it
trump, Think of it, a president of the United States who's made our economy, with a lot of help from all of you, frankly, but from Mike and from some of our great senators and some of our great people that we have with us, we made this the strongest economy in our history
trump, We've rebuilt our military
trump, We're taking care of healthcare like nobody's been able to do
trump, What we've done is incredible
trump, And by the way, we're protecting your Second Amendment
trump, If you don't have me, your Second Amendment is gone
trump, So we have the greatest economy, the greatest military
trump, We've rebuilt our military, 2
trump, 5 trillion, because when I took it over, it was a mess
trump, And what do they want to do Let's impeach our president, right I don't think so
trump, I don't think so
trump, I think we're going to have a turnout the likes of which we've never seen in the history of our country
trump, So we were really forced, just to put it away, we were forced
trump, I said, Just do it
trump, Got the approval from Ukraine
trump, I have to ask
trump, I said, Hey, do you guys mind They said, That's a strange request
trump, I said, Don't worry about it
trump, Do you mind And they said, Please, go ahead
trump, Nothing was said wrong on that call
trump, So we released the transcript of the call, which was so good that that crooked Adam Schiff, this guy is crooked, he had to make up a fake conversation that never happened- A fake conversation that never happened, and he delivered it to the United States Congress and the American people
trump, It was a total fraud
trump, And then Nancy Pelosi said, Oh, I think the president said that
trump, These people are sick
trump, I'm telling you, they're sick
trump, And you know what Had they waited one day longer, they would have had the transcript of the actual call, word for word
trump, It would've been perfect
trump, Instead, they released it, they went early, they said all these horrible things
trump, You know why Because they never thought in a million years that I was going to release a transcript of the call
trump, So Nancy Pelosi, upon hearing a false story from a whistleblower that had no clue what was going on in that call, or somebody gave her very bad advice, but also hearing it from shifty shift Nancy Pelosi said, a day before seeing the transcript of the call with the Ukrainian president, We've got to impeach him
trump, We've got to impeach him
trump, Right And then she saw the call and she said to her people, What the hell Nobody ever told me this was the call
trump, But she keeps going anyway because the press is fake and they play right into their hands
trump, The do nothing democratic extremists have gone so far left that they believe it should not be a crime to cross our border illegally, and it should be a crime to have a totally appropriate casual, beautiful, accurate phone call with a foreign leader
trump, I don't think so
trump, As our brilliant White House counsel wrote to the Democrats yesterday, he said, Their highly partisan and unconstitutional effort threatens grave and lasting damage to our democratic institutions, to our system of free elections, and to the American people
trump, That's what it is
trump, To the American people
trump, It's so terrible
trump, Democrats are on a crusade to destroy our democracy
trump, That's what's happening
trump, We will never let it happen
trump, We will defeat them
trump, I mean, look at their debates
trump, These people are crazy
trump, They want to spend 99 trillion to redo buildings all over the United States
trump, I said, What about China What about Russia What about India What about all these other countries where that stuff is just flowing out It's all right
trump, Let him give you the answer
trump, Man, did the cops act fast
trump, He's already gone
trump, That's unbelievable
trump, That's the fastest … You know I have … Look, I love law enforcement
trump, I love the cops
trump, I love the police, all of it
trump, Minneapolis, Minneapolis, you've got a rotten man
trump, You've got to change your mayor
trump, You've got a bad mayor
trump, You've got a bad mayor
trump, But you know what The police … I've done this a lot and every once in a while we'll have very little disturbance
trump, It's really … Actually, is there any place where we can have more fun than at a Trump rally And we've set every record at every place, virtually, that we've gone
trump, And one of the big musicians said, And Trump does it without a guitar
trump, Can you believe it Without a guitar
trump, But this guy … So I've had it a lot where … But sometimes it'll take the police like 30 seconds, 50 seconds
trump, It's like Roger Penske when you watch him, who's getting the Presidential Medal of Freedom, by the way, pretty soon
trump, He won 18 Indy 500s, 18, Roger Penske
trump, But it's like the way they change those tires, takes four seconds to change the whole damn thing
trump, I say, How the hell do they do it That's the way these cops just reacted
trump, That was a record
trump, I think it was a … I've had good service, but I've never had anything like that
trump, I look up, the guy is already gone
trump, Ah, we love you with the red shirts
trump, So now the Democrats are making a pathetic bid to save sleepy Joe, sleepy Joe Biden
trump, And you know what I'd love to run against him, to be honest
trump, Anybody like that
trump, If you can't beat him in a debate, you've got a big problem folks
trump, You can't beat him in a debate, you can't be president
trump, Because what are you going to do against President Xi and Kim Jong Un
trump, You can't beat sleepy Joe, but now we're going to meet with Kim Jong Un I don't think so
trump, But he's totally owned and totally controlled by the Washington swamp for many years
trump, Two months after president Obama put Joe in charge of Ukraine policy, they put Joe Biden in charge of Ukraine policy
trump, Listen to this
trump, And the press will not write it
trump, They say, In totally unsubstantiated charges … every time they talk about him
trump, President Trump has said that his son walked away with a fortune
trump, Now you know that's a totally unsubstantiated charge
trump, Really It's not an unsubstantiated, it's fact
trump, Joe's son Hunter got thrown out of the Navy and then he became a genius on Wall Street in about two days
trump, By the way, whatever happened to Hunter
trump, Where the hell is he Where's Hunter Hey fellows, I have an idea for a new t-shirt
trump, I love the cops, but let's do another t-shirt
trump, Where's Hunter Where is he Here's Hunter, being examined by sleepy eyes Chuck Todd or some of these people
trump, Hunter, it's so great that you're here, sir
trump, Hunter, I know they're giving you approximately 168,000 a month
trump, I hear they paid you a big check of 3 million
trump, I just want to speak on behalf of NBC who's absolutely one of the worst
trump, I just want to tell you … Hunter, Hunter I just want to tell you I couldn't be happier for you and your family and I know you don't know anything about energy and I know it's an energy company, but I think they made a great deal, Hunter
trump, And then they fly to China, and I'm dealing with people right now
trump, They're tough as hell, those Chinese negotiators, and Hunter, who's not too smart, Hunter
trump, He goes in, he has a meeting, he walks out in his fund with 1
trump,5 billion, with a B, one point five billion dollars
trump, These aren't the same Chinese negotiators that I'm dealing with, I can tell you
trump, These are not the same ones, but we are doing very well in that negotiation
trump, Now, think of it, where's Hunter Where is Hunter I want to see Hunter Hunter, you know nothing about energy, you know nothing about China, you know nothing about anything, frankly
trump, Hunter, you're a loser
trump, Why did you get one point five billion dollars, Hunter
trump, And your father was never considered smart
trump, He was never considered a good Senator
trump, He was only a good vice president because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama's ass
trump, True
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you
trump, It's true
trump, It's true
trump, And they're always saying the same thing
trump, Yeah, he got a billion five, we admit it, they admit it, it's nothing, but oh, it's not that same thing, president Trump made a totally unsubstantiated claim about Hunter Biden and his father
trump, It's not unsubstantiated, you crooked son of a guns, it's 100 true
trump, 100
trump, Even the smart guys on Wall Street, and I know all of them, they are smart
trump, They've never seen anything like that one before
trump, I've called them
trump, Does that ever happen Never happens
trump, Guy walks in, no experience, no nothing
trump, Walks out with a billion five
trump, Gee
trump, Flies in on Air Force Two with his father, the vice president
trump, Don't forget, that's when he was vice president
trump, So China gives his son 1
trump,5 billion
trump, How would you like to have Joe Biden take over negotiations right now with China I don't think so
trump, I don't think so
trump, Meanwhile, Biden allowed China to rip off America for eight years as vice president, and Barack Obama let him just rob us blind, and we're not doing that anymore
trump, Those days are over
trump, The Bidens got rich and that is substantiated
trump, While America got robbed, that's what happened
trump, Sleepy Joe and his friends out America, they didn't have tough negotiations
trump, I look at these trade deals and I say, Who the hell could have done this If you didn't … If you had no business instinct, no business ability, if you had nothing, if you're dumb as hell, you wouldn't make these deals, they're so bad
trump, I say, Who made these deals Who made these deals But we're ripping them all up and redoing them and they're going to be very good
trump, Wait until you see what happens
trump, Now that I'm your president, you see it
trump, America is winning again and we're respected again as a nation
trump, A brand new report just came out as I'm walking on the stage
trump, Hard to believe, actually
trump, It turns out that Joe Biden was vice president, he worked with the so called whistle blower
trump, This is nothing but a partisan witch hunt, sabotage, and I'm sure they're going to say it's totally unsubstantiated, but one of them wrote this story
trump, Congratulations, by the way
trump, That's very nice
trump, That's really good
trump, That's the way you should do it
trump, Good
trump, Good
trump, Good
trump, In the twisted worldview of Democrats and the media, it's okay for politicians to ship our jobs to foreign countries, flood our communities with drugs and crime, and enrich themselves at America's expense
trump, Their treachery is allowed because they go along with the rigged Washington game, and it is far more rigged
trump, When I ran, I thought it was rigged, but this is crazy what's happening
trump, But if you refuse to bow or bend to the Washington swamp, which I could do very easily, I'd be much more popular
trump, Folks, it would be so much easier
trump, But they smear you, they spy on you, and they target your friends, your family, your staff for harassment, for abuse, for destruction
trump, I came down to Washington with incredible people
trump, We won a great political campaign
trump, They were bright eyed and bushy tailed
trump, that's a nice phrase
trump, They came down, they were happy
trump, They wanted to turn the country around
trump, They wanted to do great things
trump, All of a sudden they get summoned and they get subpoenaed by Robert Mueller
trump, How good was he as a witness Not too good and by people that were, I call them the 13 angry Democrats, that turned into 18 angry Democrats
trump, It was disgraceful
trump, So people that were going down, Sir, what is this I look, Oh wow, that's a subpoena
trump, What the hell is this They took people … I really mean this
trump, They took people that were full of life and energy and vigor
trump, We had just won the greatest campaign in the history of American politics, it's true
trump, It's true
trump, And they destroyed their lives
trump, They destroyed their lives
trump, They went home
trump, I could name many people, one in particular, who came down, an incredible young woman
trump, She was going to help people
trump, She wanted to help people
trump, She had causes that were so good
trump, She wanted to help people, and she ended up going home, dark, dark
trump, Her life became hell
trump, They ruined people
trump, They destroyed people, good people
trump, People that ended up paying far more money in legal fees than they made
trump, Than they made
trump, They destroyed great people
trump, They're vicious, horrible, and the media was behind every single step
trump, They destroyed so many lives
trump, They destroyed so many lives, and they're continuing to do it
trump, And it's a disgrace
trump, When all of their ludicrous hoaxes have been exposed as frauds, these sinister fakers then tried to impeach you for daring to call out their own corruption
trump, There's nothing like the dirty political establishment, and I have to tell you, this is, friend of mine, very smart, brilliant guy, was with me about two weeks ago
trump, We just got rid of the Russia hoax and then a week later the Ukraine hoax starts
trump, I had a week of like, I can think about everything perfect
trump, It's so beautiful
trump, And he said, President
trump, I said, Call me Donald
trump, You've called me Donald for 35 years
trump, I will
trump, Thank you Donald
trump, I've lost all my friends because they're all scared to talk
trump, Honestly, I'm the president that they can't talk to me anymore
trump, It's like they're afraid
trump, They respect the office
trump, It's true
trump, They say, President
trump, I say, Do me a favor, Richard
trump, You've called me Donald for 35 years
trump, Call me Donald, please
trump, I want somebody to call me Donald
trump, True
trump, He said to me, I just told him call me … He said, President, I can't do it
trump, He said
trump, So he says, President, you've been here now for, think of it, almost three years
trump, Can you believe we're here three years We, we, it's we
trump, And we have to promise them no more than 16 years
trump, Okay No more
trump, No more
trump, 16 more years
trump, I'm only kidding
trump, Now they'll go back
trump, See, he wants to run for more
trump, But he said, President, could I ask you a question It's so important to me
trump, He's a great businessman, very successful
trump, He said, You deal with all of these nations, these great, powerful … Who is the worst to deal with Is it China Is it North Korea Is India Is it Russia Please tell me, Mr
trump, Pres, who is the toughest nation to deal with I said, You're not going to believe this
trump, It's the USA is the toughest nation to deal with
trump, The USA
trump, It's true
trump, Because we're dealing with some very sick and deranged people
trump, There is nothing that the dirty political establishment hates more than a president that they cannot intimidate, own and control
trump, They're trying to stop me because they know that I don't answer to them, I answer to you
trump, It's true
trump, I never say this
trump, I don't think I've ever said it in a speech, but they'll find out if I did
trump, They'll give me Pinocchios, he said it before, but I don't know if I ever said this before
trump, But I make, as president, about 450,000
trump, I give it away
trump, I don't care
trump, I don't want it
trump, I never hear anything
trump, Can you imagine if I didn't
trump, I give it away to … You can only give it, you can't keep it
trump, You can't actually make a gift
trump, You can give it to your different agencies
trump, So I can give it to health, I can give it to transportation, I can give it to military, but I give it away all the time
trump, Now, and if I ever did … But it's 450
trump, If somebody stays from, let's say, a middle East country in one of my hotels and we charge him 392 dollars and 53 cents for staying, and I never heard of the guy and I don't want to hear about him, they say, Trump is getting rich off our nation
trump, I lose billions being president
trump, I don't care
trump, It's nice to be rich, I guess
trump, But I lose billions
trump, If somebody rents a room someplace and they pay me two months in rent or hotel fees, I never heard of the people
trump, I never know who they are
trump, They say, Emoluments
trump, Nobody ever heard of the word emoluments before
trump, Emoluments
trump, It's the craziest thing I've ever seen
trump, I tell you, it's cost me billions of dollars to be president
trump, It really has
trump, And at some point I'll probably to prove that, and I look forward to doing it
trump,
trump, It's very easy
trump, It's very easy
trump, And there is nothing that makes me happier than making that decision to run and win and straighten out the mess that these people have created
trump, So in desperate attempt to attack our movement
trump, Nancy and Chuck, two beauties, have given control of the Democrat party entirely over to the radical left, including Minnesota's own representative Ilhan Omar
trump, I know you people
trump, I know you people
trump, I know the people of Minnesota, and I want to tell you, and I also, at the same time, it's both a question and a statement, how'd the hell did that ever happen How did it happen How did it happen Congresswoman Omar is an America hating socialist
trump, She minimized the September 11th attack on our homeland
trump, Where far more than 3,000 people died, saying, Some people did something big deal
trump, Some people did something
trump, She pleaded for compassion for ISIS recruits right here in Minnesota
trump, Omar laughed that Americans speak of Al-Qaeda
trump, You remember that tape Speak of Al-Qaeda
trump, But when we say something about the United States, you just don't say America with any intensity
trump, Remember that Representative Omar has a history of launching virulent anti-semitic screeds, whether you like it or not
trump, She's said the US support for Israel is all about the Benjamins
trump, She said that pro-Israel lawmakers have an allegiance to a foreign country
trump, Omar wrote that Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them to see the evil doings of Israel and the United States
trump, How do you have such a person representing you in Minnesota I'm very angry at you people right now
trump, She is a disgrace to our country, and she is one of the big reasons that I'm going to win, and the Republican party is going to win Minnesota in 13 months
trump, Thank you very much
trump, So we're honored to have with us today a special guest, a man that really is a terrific talented writer
trump, He knows a great deal about all those tangled lies of Omar
trump, Mr
trump, Scott Johnson of Power Line
trump, He wrote some stuff, I can't believe it
trump, Where's Scott Where's Scott Thank you, Scott
trump, Thank you, Scott
trump, What a job
trump, Man, do you have her figured out
trump, The only problem is, Scott, it's incredible talent, much more talented than most of these people that you heard about
trump, The problem is they never pick it up
trump, They don't want to pick it up, but we pick it up, Scott, and the people get it and we thank you for your great reporting
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you very much
trump, And Scott reported everything about Omar is a fraud, including her name
trump, Scott reports his sources told him that, quote, Omar's legal husband was Omar's brother and that she had married him for fraudulent purposes
trump, You mean like coming into the United States, maybe And as Scott says, We have seen a plethora of congressional scandals in our history yet we have never seen scandals like Omar's in Congress, and nothing gets done about it
trump, I hope that some of you people are looking, because what AOC has gotten away with campaign financing and what … I call it AOC plus three, that's what it is
trump, And Omar is one of the three
trump, What AOC has gotten away with all of that money that she used for her personal self with campaign finance is worse, and nothing happens to them, but it happens to you, and it's not fair
trump, The fact is, we're in a struggle for the survival of democracy in America
trump, The only message these radical socialists and extremists will understand- Message these radical socialists and extremists will understand is a crushing defeat on November 3rd, 2020
trump, With your help, we will win back the House, we will keep the Senate and we will win the White House
trump, And we're thrilled to be joined tonight by some incredible people that have helped me so much
trump, One of your tremendous talented, tough, Congressman Tom Emmer
trump, Tom
trump, Also a man, you don't want to fight him, and you don't want to play him in hockey because he was tough
trump, He just won, not that recently but pretty recently, and I was out here campaigning for him and working hard, and it turned out to be an easy race because everyone loves him and respects him
trump, Congressman Pete Stauber
trump, And a man who gets in the trenches, and he just doesn't care
trump, He wants to win for the people
trump, He loves you
trump, He loves this state
trump, He loves this country
trump, Jim Hagedorn
trump, Thank you
trump, And a great friend of mine with his incredible family
trump, He's a friend
trump, He's smart
trump, I guess you'd say he's brilliant
trump, His education is incredible, his military career has been incredible
trump, Then he ran for office, and now he's a United States Senator from the great state of Arkansas, Senator Tom Cotton
trump, Great guy
trump, And Minnesota Senate Majority Leader, Paul Gazelka
trump, Paul
trump, Thank you Paul
trump, Minnesota GOP Chairwoman, Jennifer Carnahan
trump, She's been incredible
trump, I said, Jennifer, are we going to win in 13 months She said, Honestly sir, I've never seen anything like this
trump, It's going to be easy
trump, Don't ever say… Just assume we're two points behind, okay Two points behind
trump, You never ever… Please
trump, Always just assume you're a little behind, but we're going to win this state by so much that people are going to be shocked
trump, Ad plenty of other states too
trump, We had a rally three weeks ago in New Mexico, and New Mexico's a hard state for Republicans, hasn't been won in a long time also
trump, And we had receptivity that was unbelievable
trump, The audience was 40 Hispanic, where we're doing great
trump, And you know, Hispanic, they understand borders better than anybody, better than we do
trump, They understand safety, they understand their job, they don't want people taking it away, they don't want crime
trump, They understand it better
trump, That's why we're doing so well, but we're in New Mexico, and I'm telling you, that was electric
trump, But honestly, all evenings are electric
trump, We haven't had any bad ones
trump, We haven't
trump, They're all electric
trump, A woman who headed up the great state of Michigan for me, a state that hadn't been won in a long time by a Republican for whatever reason, but it hadn't been won
trump, I guess we didn't have the right candidates, right But a woman who would call me constantly
trump, I'd say, I don't want to talk to her
trump, She's giving me a headache
trump, Sir, if you make one more trip, you're going to win Michigan
trump, I say, All right, I make the trip, I go back home
trump, I get a call the next morning, Sir, we need one more
trump, This went over and over and over, and we ended up winning the state of Michigan, and I said, Who the hell was that woman that kept bugging me to go back to Michigan and speak just one more time every week One more time, sir
trump, And her name is Ronna McDaniel
trump, She's fantastic, and she's the head of the RNC
trump, She's great
trump, And our campaign manager, a man who's really been… They used to say that Crooked Hillary had a very very sophisticated campaign
trump, After she lost, they said, I guess it wasn't sophisticated
trump, We had a sophisticated campaign
trump, Nobody knows the world of computers better than this guy
trump, Brad Parscale
trump, Remember when they used to say it You know, I never got credit
trump, My father used to teach me, if you can do it for less and win, that's good
trump, He wasn't talking politics
trump, The last thing… He's looking down
trump, He's definitely looking down, not looking up
trump, He was great
trump, He was tough, but he was great
trump, But my father would say, If you could do it for less and win, that's a good thing, not a bad thing
trump, If you can build a building for less money than the guy across the street, and if it's a nicer building and you can rent for less, you're really… That's like a good thing
trump, So in the campaign, we spent much less money than Crooked Hillary Clinton, much
trump, And we won
trump, And we won
trump, We won 306 to 223
trump, That's a pretty big… Remember Remember they said electoral college
trump, By the way, when you run, if you're running, the electoral college is like the 100 yard dash, and the total vote, you don't go certain places
trump, You focus
trump, Electoral college
trump, We have to explain to them, it's different
trump, So we won 306, and do you remember they sued to say one's the 100 yard dash
trump, You practice
trump, One's the mile
trump, You practice
trump, It's a different race
trump, Winning the total vote is much easier in my opinion
trump, The electoral college, I had to go to 22 different states
trump, For the total vote, I'd go to four states maximum, right Much easier
trump, It's much easier
trump, I'm all for it, but the electoral college is better for our country because it forces you to go places that you wouldn't go
trump, I love Maine
trump, I went to Maine four or five times
trump, I needed one point
trump, Maine gave me one point
trump, And what happened What happened I went there numerous times
trump, Everyone said, Why Because I was told by these fraudsters back here in the media that Trump cannot get to 270
trump, He cannot get… They had me maximum, if everything worked, right At 269
trump, So I kept going to Maine, and you know what We won that one point in Maine
trump, We won it
trump, It's true
trump, But I kept going
trump, They say, Why I said, Well, first of all, it is really a beautiful place, but we won the point
trump, But they said, He can not get to 270, and I heard this for months and months
trump, I had such a headache, almost as bad as listening to Mike's damn commercials about those pillows
trump, Maybe I need one of those pillows to cure my headache
trump, Does it cure headaches I think so
trump, But here's the thing
trump, Here's the thing
trump, So they said, He cannot get to 270
trump, In other words, you can't win
trump, You don't get to 270, it's over
trump, You can't win, right He cannot do it
trump, There's no way of doing it, and they were right
trump, I got to 306
trump, They were right
trump, But I didn't get to 306
trump, You got to 306
trump, We won incredible states
trump, We won incredible states
trump, We won Wisconsin, we won Michigan, we won Pennsylvania, we won North Carolina, we won South Carolina, we won Florida
trump, What a run
trump, Do you remember the evening that we won I think… Look, forgetting me, I think it was won of all of us together because we all worked hard
trump, I was the messenger, but we all worked hard
trump, That was our victory, not my victory
trump, But that was one of the greatest nights in the history of television, one of the greatest nights, and hopefully it'll go down when we're allowed to get all of this stuff seeded… You know, it's like a tree
trump, You plant it
trump, You plant it
trump, It has to go, but it needs a little… That's why we need the four more additionally years
trump, It's got to grab on and catch, so they can't destroy it
trump, So they can't destroy it
trump, But I think it'll go down, and I hope it's going to go down as one of the greatest evenings in the history of this country, because it's never happened, anything like that before
trump, And these guys don't even question it
trump, They just sit back and say, I guess he's right about that
trump, I'll never forget the night before, I was at a tremendous arena
trump, The place was going crazy
trump, It was like this, going crazy, and two reporters that hate my guts, they looked at themselves, they looked at each other
trump, Famous shot
trump, They're looking like this and they're saying, What the hell is going on They knew
trump, They knew
trump, And I didn't need Beyonce and Jay Z, and I didn't need little Bruce Springsteen and all of these people
trump, They'd get all these people
trump, They'd come in because she couldn't get a crowd
trump, They'd come in, they'd sing
trump, They got Bruce Springsteen
trump, Okay He'd do about two songs and leave
trump, What happens is, they leave, and then everyone leaves with them, and she's still speaking in front of the same lousy crowd
trump, It's the craziest thing I've ever seen
trump, And then they complain
trump, Sometimes I'll use terrible word like hell
trump, The other day I used the word hell
trump, I got hell from… They said, He used terrible language
trump, I used the word hell
trump, It was so bad
trump, But you've got to hear Jay Z, the words he was using, he was using the F word all over the place, and then the next day they say I use bad language
trump, The word hell is a terrible word
trump, These people are sick
trump, But that was an amazing evening
trump, I'll never forget that evening
trump, Look
trump, Outside of your family and your children and things… I love you too, darling
trump, It was one of the highest rated evenings in the history of television
trump, You add up all those networks
trump, Remember the woman crying Oh my God
trump, No, they weren't biased at all
trump, Now, another very special man who's with us today, but he'll never be a man to me, he'll always be my boy, you know what I mean Right He's my boy
trump, He's my little six foot six boy, Eric Trump
trump, And the parents understand that, right They may be big and strong and older
trump, To a parent, a child is always their boy or always their little beautiful girl, and I know that's probably politically incorrect
trump, They'll say, It was terrible what he said about women
trump, Terrible
trump, But they're our boy and they're our girl, and it doesn't matter how old we get and how old they get, is that a correct statement And I'm also proud to endorse your next Republican Senator from Minnesota, a man that I've known, a man that is tough and smart, a man that's running against somebody that's never done a damn thing in the Senate, Mr
trump, Jason Lewis
trump, And Jason did a great job in Congress
trump, Congressman Lewis, thank you very much, and thank you for putting up with all of this stuff because I'll tell you, it's going to be nasty
trump, It's going to be nasty
trump, They're going to make up stories about you
trump, They're going to say things that's going to want to make your wife say, Why did I marry this guy Just say, Don't worry about it
trump, It's just another phony story
trump, Thank you very much Mr
trump, and Mrs
trump, Lewis
trump, Jason, thank you
trump, And Jason, they can say that about Tom Cotton
trump, He's too perfect, this guy
trump, He can't say… They can't say it about you, Tom
trump, Anyway, good luck Jason
trump, Do well
trump, And I don't know why, but with all of the great people I just introduced, for tonight, maybe this is the most important person, because I turned on a very good show in the morning
trump, Fox and friends
trump, They treat us great
trump, I just want fairness
trump, What a great group
trump, Ainsley and Steve, and by the way, Brian has gotten a lot better, right And how good does Jessie Waters do How good Right Just some really great people
trump, And again, Tucker's been very good I have to say
trump, He's been good
trump, Smart
trump, He's been great
trump, Tucker, and the legendary Sean Hannity
trump, Great
trump, Number one
trump, Number one show
trump, Sean's got the number one show
trump, And Laura Ingraham is knocking them out of the park, Laura
trump, And you go over, Maria Bartiromo, and the great Lou Dobbs
trump, How good are they Lou Dobbs
trump, And many more
trump, And many more
trump, How about Greg Greg used to hate me
trump, Now, he's good
trump, Oh, we can't forget… We can't forget Judge Jeanine
trump, I would be in such trouble if I forgot Judge Jeanine
trump, No, these are… And there are many more
trump, I just… Look, I'm just rattling some names off, but they're just terrific people
trump, They're terrific people
trump, But a man that I have to really say something very special about… 00 slot, because I'm out of there pretty good, and I see a handsome young man named Bob Kroll, Cops For Trump
trump, And he's talking about this lousy mayor they've got
trump, Now, he didn't quite say that, but I say it
trump, He's talking about this lousy mayor that won't let the cops, the police, the law enforcement… My father always used to say, Son… And he meant it to
trump, Never say cops
trump, It's disrespectful
trump, Say police officer
trump, I said, Okay Pop
trump, But honestly, the truth is with time, I love you guys whether you're cops, police officers, law enforcement
trump, I'll call you whatever you want
trump, It doesn't matter
trump, You are so great, so respected
trump, You don't even know how much our public loves you
trump, You don't know it
trump, You don't know it
trump, You don't know it
trump, But I see this guy, and I don't know if he's done a lot of television before, but he was very effective and very good
trump, And he was saying how the police aren't being allowed to take care of this rally, and yet with President Obama and Bush and all these people, they were fine, fine
trump, Everybody comes
trump, They fall asleep at a rally
trump, But they weren't allowed to do the job for us, and they went wild
trump, So what I want to do… Go home to Mommy
trump, Mommy says, I saw you on television tonight
trump, I love Trump
trump, Don't you ever do that again
trump, Yes Mom
trump, Yes Mom
trump, But the job he did before the election, I came right here to Minnesota, and I pledged to address this really important issue, and it's the issue of law enforcement
trump, And when I saw this man, this great gentleman on television pouring out his guts, pouring out his heart… I don't know him
trump, He knows I've been good to law enforcement
trump, He knows I've been good to, as my father would say, The police
trump, He knows I love the cops
trump, He knows that, and so does everyone else
trump, I mean, it's so many shirts, so many red shirts, and there are plenty of people here without the red shirts, and I want to just tell you, the respect that we have for law enforcement is unbound
trump, It's unbound
trump, Come up here
trump, Bob, come up
trump, Say something
trump, Thank you fellas
trump, I'll see you later
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you very much
trump, Thank you
trump, Great people
trump, Thank you
trump, What a group
trump, I think your very weak mayor made a mistake when he took them on
trump, As you know, for many years, leaders in Washington brought large numbers of refugees to your state from Somalia without considering the impact on schools and communities and taxpayers
trump, I promised you that as president, I would give local communities a greater say in refugee policy, and put in place enhanced vetting and responsible immigration controls
trump, And I've done that
trump, Since coming into office, I have reduced refugee resettlement by 85, and as you know, maybe especially in Minnesota, I kept another promise
trump, I issued an executive action, making clear that no refugees will be resettled in any city or any state without the express written consent of that city or that state
trump, So speak to your mayor
trump, You should be able to decide what is best for your own cities and for your own neighborhoods, and that's what you have the right to do right now
trump, And believe me, no other president would be doing that
trump, If Democrats were ever to seize power, they would open the floodgates to unvetted, uncontrolled migration at levels you have never seen before
trump, Do you think you have it bad now You would never have seen anything like what they want to do
trump, But in the Trump administration, we will always protect American families first, and that has not been done in Minnesota
trump, We've also implemented the strongest screening and vetting mechanisms ever put into place
trump, We are keeping terrorists, criminals and extremists the hell out of our country
trump, And I want to thank the country of Mexico
trump, The president of Mexico has been incredible
trump, We have now, 27,000 Mexican soldiers
trump, They're great, and they're tough, and they are now protecting our border, and those numbers have gone down like this
trump, Thank you Mr
trump, President
trump, We will not make the mistakes made in European countries, that allow a violent ideology to take root in our country, on our shores
trump, We're not going to allow it to happen
trump, And as you all know, to protect our citizens from those who would do harm to us, I instituted a very controversial, very hard to get, travel ban on some of the world's most dangerous countries
trump, And the other day, one of the fake news reporters in the back said… They were talking about the travel ban, and they said, Well you know, the president has lost in court
trump, They said, Where On the travel ban
trump, And he's right
trump, I lost, and then I lost at the appellate division, and then I won at the United States Supreme Court
trump, Right And he knew that, but he said I lost on the… And he was right
trump, I lost, and then I lost again, but then I won, and we have the travel ban
trump, But instead of saying, He lost, and then he lost at the appellate, and then he won at the United States Supreme Court, he said, He lost on the travel ban
trump, These are very dishonest people
trump, Do you understand that Very dishonest people
trump, In the Republican party, we believe that those who seek to join our society must embrace our values, honor our history, and love our people
trump, Democrats also support deadly sanctuary cities, which release dangerous criminal aliens into the heart of your communities, and we're not letting it happen anymore
trump, Republicans believe American cities should be sanctuaries for Americans, not for criminal aliens
trump, My administration is taking historic action to secure the border
trump, We have reduced illegal border crossings by over 60 since May, and we are building the wall faster than anyone ever anticipated it could be built
trump, And this is a serious wall
trump, You've all seen it
trump, It's going up rapidly, and you think that was easy I had every Democrat in Congress fighting me, fighting me, fighting me
trump, I had a lot of the rhinos fighting me
trump, They say, See, he's not getting it built
trump, He's not getting… Let me tell you
trump, You have every Democrat fighting you
trump, We took it from here, and we took it from there, and we took it from all over the place, and we got that thing
trump, That's the biggest patchwork of financing you've ever seen, and that sucker is going up, and it is the finest, it is the strongest, it's largely 30 feet tall, which is the maximum height that they wanted
trump, I went to the Border Patrol, and I sat down with 15 representatives of the Border Patrol, and I said, What do you want What's your ideal I actually said, I want to give you the Rolls Royce, and they killed me for that
trump, They said, It's not an American made product
trump, Yeah, they happened to be right
trump, No, they're right about that one
trump, They're actually right there, Tom
trump, But I said, I want to give you the Rolls Royce of walls
trump, Tell me
trump, And they told me everything, and then we built some alternative walls
trump, We built all different types
trump, We built about seven of them, and then we had climbers come in
trump, The one that worked the best was the one we're building
trump, It also, unfortunately… The bad news, it's also the most expensive
trump, But we got it for the right price
trump, We got it for the right price
trump, It's steel, it's hardened concrete, it's deep, it's high, it's a thing of beauty
trump, And it's going to keep bad people out of our country
trump, That's what it's going to do
trump, And the Democrats knew this
trump, Most of the Democrats four years ago, they wanted a wall
trump, Now all of a sudden, they don't want a wall
trump, You know why they don't want a wall Because I want it
trump, That's the only reason
trump, And I just thought of it a year ago
trump, I said, Man, this could've been so much easier
trump, All I had to do is say, We don't want a wall, and they would've given me all the financing I wanted for the wall
trump, What was I thinking We're not going to build a wall, and they would have forced me to build it
trump, I would've… It's true
trump, Under this administration, we are also ending the- … this administration
trump, We are also ending the endless wars
trump, We have to do it, folks
trump, We have to do it
trump, We have totally defeated the ISIS caliphate, and I did that in rather quick time if you remember, because we have the greatest fighting machine, now
trump, When I came in and was totally depleted
trump, We have great generals, we have great warfighters, and they did it so fast
trump, I flew to Iraq, I met with the generals, right I met with the generals
trump, I said, I hear it's going to take a year to two years
trump, Sir, we can do it in two weeks
trump, I said, What They don't let us fight, sir
trump, They don't let us fight
trump, We want to fight
trump, They don't let us fight
trump, I said, I let you fight
trump, I said, How come if they say it's going to take anywhere from a year to two years, you say you can do it so quickly He said, Sir, we're going to hit them from the front
trump, We're going to hit them from the back
trump, We're going to hit them from the sides, from underground, from overground
trump, We going to hit the hell out of them
trump, And they did
trump, And we won very quickly
trump, But from now on, we want to fight where it is to the benefit of the United States of America, not to the benefit of other countries
trump, And we will only fight to win
trump, We're only going to fight to win
trump, We don't fight to win
trump, We don't fight to win
trump, The Turks have been fighting with the Kurds for two centuries, and Turkey, as you know, is a NATO ally
trump, But I've been rough on them
trump, We've defeated 100 of that ISIS caliphate, and no longer have any troops in the area
trump, We don't have any troops
trump, The troops have been pulled out
trump, Where Turkey is carrying out now a very tough campaign against the Kurds, get them out
trump, So Turkey is right now waging a very tough campaign against the Kurds
trump, We got along with the Kurds, and we helped the Kurds
trump, And don't forget they're also fighting for their land
trump, You know that
trump, But they're fighting
trump, So we have three choices
trump, You're ready Here are the three choices
trump, We don't have any soldiers there because we've left
trump, We won
trump, We left
trump, Take a victory, United States
trump, We left
trump, Take a victory, take a victory
trump, Bring our troops back home
trump, I told this story yesterday, I have to sign letters, it's the hardest thing I have to do
trump, I sign letters, Dear Mr
trump, and Mrs
trump, Smith from Arkansas
trump, Dear Mr
trump, and Mrs
trump, Jones from Alabama
trump, Dear Mr
trump, and Mrs
trump, Somebody from some great state, I'm sorry to inform you, your son has been killed in combat
trump, I'm so sorry
trump, And every letter is individually done because sometimes the parents, they're grieving, and they get together with other parents, and I don't want to see that it's like the same letter
trump, So we do different letters
trump, It's the hardest thing I have to do
trump, Hardest thing
trump,it's the hardest thing I have … I was telling Tom Cotton, it's the hardest thing that I have to do
trump, And I sign those letters, and it just, it breaks your heart
trump, And by the way, there's a time to fight
trump, Nobody fights harder than I do
trump, But there's a time, and there's not necessarily a time
trump, But I send these letters out, quite a few
trump, And sometimes I send letters out, it's called blue on green, where we're teaching people how to fight and then they turn the gun on our soldiers and shoot them in the back
trump, And that's the hardest thing for a parent
trump, I have all of them
trump, I know everyone
trump, That's the hardest thing for a parent when they get notification, because they learn how their child has died
trump, When the so-called people that were teaching how to fight turn the gun on them, and shoot
trump, We've had a lot of that, a lot of it in Afghanistan, more than we've ever had proportionately before
trump, It's a horrible, horrible thing
trump, But I have to sign these letters
trump, And sometimes I go out to a place, Dover Air Force Base, it's a very tough experience
trump, Mike Pence goes, I go, other people go, Tom Cotton goes
trump, We go out there, and we meet the parents and the families, the wives, the children, the sisters, the brothers
trump, We meet them, and we talked to them, and their son or daughter is being flown in from some far away place in a coffin, and these things are just impossible
trump, I don't know how parents can do it, even
trump, And I'll meet them
trump, And we have a particular Colonel, that's all he does
trump, So good
trump, So professional
trump, That's what he does
trump, He said, I greet the dead, sir
trump, I greet the dead
trump, And what happens is this big incredible machine flies in, this tremendous cargo plane, and it flies in so powerful, so big
trump, I'll be talking to some of the parents, and they'll act like they're fine
trump, I said, How are you doing We're fine, sir
trump, We're fine
trump, We're really good
trump, I say, That's great
trump, And I'll tell the Colonel, I'll say, Colonel, I think they're doing great
trump, No sir, they're not going to do great
trump, You'll see
trump, And I didn't know what he was talking about, this is the first time
trump, Then we went outside to the runway, and this incredible machine is flying in, and it lands, and it comes over, and it pulls up, and we have military guards, we have incredible talented musicians that do this
trump, That's what they do
trump, What happens is that door opens up, and the Colonel told me, he said, Sir, when that door opens up, those same people that you think are okay, do things that you'll never see
trump, You will hear sounds like you've never heard
trump, That's what he does
trump, I saw that door open up with a coffin with a flag over it
trump, The door was opened, and these beautiful soldiers, five or six on each side, lifting the coffin and walking down the runway, the plank, they call it, off this cargo plane
trump, And I see parents make sounds, that were just 20 minutes ago absolutely fine, make sounds, scream and cry like you've never seen before
trump, The Colonel was telling me that, Sir, you'll see things that you've never seen before
trump, A mother who was fine 20 minutes ago, you think, breaking the military line and jumping off, and then jumping onto a coffin of her son or her daughter, jumping on, on top of the flowers, on top of the American flag
trump, I've seen this
trump, Then I have all these people that want to stay
trump, They want to stay
trump, And I don't want to stay
trump, We were supposed to be in Syria for 30 days
trump, We've now been there for 10 years
trump, We were supposed to be in Afghanistan for a short period of time
trump, We're now going to be there for close to 19 years
trump, It's time to bring them home
trump, It's time to bring them home
trump, It's true
trump, Time to bring them home
trump, We've done our job, we've defeated everyone that we're supposed to defeat
trump, And now we are, we are policing, we are now policing
trump, That's what we're doing
trump, We're policing
trump, And that, as I said, no more respect for the police, but these are military people, and those are police, but we are now policing
trump, We're not fighting, we're policing
trump, And you know what After all of these years … One other story, and I have to tell you
trump, I go to Walter Reed on Friday, and I do it quite often
trump, I gave out five Purple Hearts
trump, And I meet people that are so beautiful, so amazing
trump, I met five warriors, and one was so badly hurt, with the loss of arms and a leg, another one … they're just very, very devastated
trump, But these are great, great people
trump, And I gave out the Purple Heart
trump, And I see the parents, and I have to say, Walter Reed, I want to just say, the doctors there, the job they do, you know, you hear so many complaints about doctors and about the vets, and the vets' care, and nobody's done better
trump, We got choice for the vets
trump, We did things for the vets that nobody thought would be possible
trump, But I saw these young men, and I gave them their Purple Hearts
trump, And their parents were there crying
trump, And one of them was so amazing
trump, I said, What's your problem Sir, my face was blown apart
trump, My nose was absolutely just blown apart
trump, He said, Sir, it's incredible
trump, And I looked at him, I said, That's the most beautiful nose I've ever seen
trump, What do you mean He said, A doctor worked on my face for 10 hours in the field
trump, He said there were a thousand fragments
trump, Now I don't know if that's right, but well, a lot
trump, He meant a lot
trump, He said there were a thousand fragments
trump, He rebuilt my nose with glue
trump, He glued the bones together
trump, He rebuilt my nose
trump, I say, You have the most beautiful nose I've ever seen, and it's true
trump, And his father came over to me, he said, Sir, father was crying, he said, Sir, honestly, my son looks better now
trump, He said, My son did not have a good look
trump, He knows
trump, Now look at it, it's beautiful, it's beautiful
trump, But these doctors at Walter Reed, and these Army, and Marine, and the medical doctors, they are unbelievably great people
trump, And they see sights that you and I hopefully will never see
trump, They see things that nobody will ever see, and there's nobody like them
trump, And I have to give a shout out to those people, there's nobody like them
trump, So in the case of Turkey, and Syria, and the Kurds, we could send in a thousand troops for a military conflict with Turkey
trump, No, you don't want to do that
trump, We could hit Turkey very hard financially
trump, Or we could mediate a deal between Turkey and the Kurds
trump, I like that
trump, You know Let's mediate a deal
trump, But remember they've been fighting each other for hundreds of years, and we were artificially put there, in this case by President Obama
trump, So we did our job
trump, We knocked out
trump, And I'll tell you another thing, we have to be treated fairly
trump, We have to be treated fairly
trump, We're not treated fairly by other nations
trump, We captured many, many ISIS fighters
trump, Most of them came from Europe
trump, They came from Germany
trump, They came from France
trump, They came from all of these countries
trump, And we called them, I called them myself in many cases, I said, Take your fighters
trump, They said, We don't want them
trump, You take them
trump, I said, No, no, no, we did you a big favor
trump, They're citizens of Germany
trump, They're citizens of France
trump, They're citizens of these various countries in Europe
trump, Take your fighters
trump, We don't want them, sir
trump, We don't want them
trump,' And I said, How unfair are we treated We do them a great favor, and they won't take the fighters
trump, So we're doing some things that are pretty amazing
trump, Every once in a while you have to change course, and do what you have to do
trump, The United States has spent 8 trillion in the Middle East
trump, We've lost thousands of brave soldiers, and tens of thousands of terribly wounded people, great people, their lives will never be the same
trump, These wars produced only chaos and bloodshed
trump, And all of the blood and treasure we sacrificed, made the Middle East, really it's less safe, it's less stable, and it's less secure
trump, And I say it all the time
trump, The single greatest mistake our country made in its history was going in to the quicksand of the Middle East
trump, We spent 8 trillion and lost thousands of lives
trump, And by the way, the other side, we can talk about that, lost millions of lives
trump, What did we do So we're going to pull them out, and we're pulling people out, and we're trying to make good deals, and we're going to bring our soldiers back home, and we may need them for something else, and they'll be ready
trump, Previous administrations lust for regime change, and also put historic Christian communities in vastly more danger than they were before we started
trump, They are some of the biggest victims of these power vacuums and reckless foreign adventures
trump, The Christians, the Christians
trump, And we work hard with the Christians
trump, We have tremendous evangelical support
trump, We work hard with the Christians
trump, So we're slowly getting out of the Middle East
trump, We're doing it carefully
trump, And we're rebuilding our military like we have never rebuilt our military before
trump, When I came into office, a very prominent general told me, because it looked like we could have a big conflict with someone, said, Sir, we have no ammunition
trump, We had old planes
trump, We had planes that were so old, they didn't fly
trump, We had people going to the desert, the plane graveyards, airplane graveyards, picking up parts
trump, I never want to hear a President of the United States hear those words again
trump, I never want to have a President hear the words, Sir, we have no ammunition
trump, Think of that
trump, Think of that
trump, Now, thanks to more than two and a half trillion dollar worth of investment in our military, we have more ammunition, more missiles, more rockets, more tanks, more fighter jets, and more of everything else than we've ever had before
trump, And we have no choice
trump, You look around the world, and we have no choice, unfortunately
trump, And the Democrats want to dismantle our military
trump, After years of building up other countries, we are finally building up our country
trump, That's what we have to do
trump, We're replacing the disaster known as NAFTA with the brand new U
trump,S
trump,-Mexico-Canada Agreement, USMCA, a giant victory for our farmers, ranchers, workers in Minnesota
trump, Congress should pass USMCA immediately
trump, We hope that Nancy Pelosi can start thinking about passing some legislation instead of thinking about nonsense
trump, And to protect our industrial backbone, I placed tariffs on foreign aluminum and foreign steel
trump, I'm also fighting back against years of chronic trade abuse from China
trump, And the supply chain of China, which was unbreakable, is now breaking wide open
trump, And they understand that
trump, And I don't blame China for what's taken place over the last 25 years
trump, I blame the people that led our country that let that happen, where hundreds of billions of dollars a year was taken from our country to build China
trump, It's not China's fault
trump, In the previous administration, they put our nation's natural resources under lock and key, including thousands and thousands of acres in a place called Superior National Forest
trump, Last year, I traveled to Duluth and announced that we would be ending this injustice, reopening Superior National Forest, and restoring mineral exploration for the iron ore mines of Minnesota
trump, Tremendous jobs
trump, And now the iron range is back in business
trump, The last time I was here, a man came up to me, he said, Sir, President Obama took our heart away, took our life away
trump,' I'll never forget it
trump, A man, strong guy, had tears in his eyes
trump, He said, You gave us back our life, because they took it away from him
trump, We gave it back
trump, Best iron ore there is anywhere
trump, My administration is also fighting the Democrat socialist healthcare agenda that would obliterate Medicare
trump, Republicans will protect Medicare, and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions
trump, And for those of you that have private healthcare, health insurance, 180 million people, they are going to end it, obliterate it, and most people are thrilled with it
trump, We are going to leave it
trump, You're going to have your plan the way you want it
trump, And there's no plan like those plans
trump, Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb, right up to the moment of birth
trump, That is why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion, because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God
trump, Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, and blatant Washington corruption
trump, The Republican Party is the party of the American worker, the American family, and it's the party of the American Dream
trump, For years, you watched as your politicians apologized for America
trump, You remember that Gee, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry
trump, Now you have a President who's standing up for America, we are standing up for Minneapolis, and we are standing up for the great state of Minnesota
trump, We begin this political campaign with the best record, the best results, the best agenda, and the only positive vision for America
trump, We begin this campaign with right now almost three years of perhaps the most successful administration in the history of our country
trump, Together, we will help millions more citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity
trump, With your help, we will reelect, and we will elect a Republican Congress to create a safe, modern, fair, and lawful system of immigration
trump, We will enact trade deals that ensure more products are proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase Made in the USA
trump, We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer, and ending the AIDS epidemic in America within 10 years
trump, Nobody thought that could be done
trump, Going to be done
trump, We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms
trump, And above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one America
trump, We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States
trump, We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement
trump, We believe in the dignity of work, and the sanctity of life
trump, We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag
trump, And we live by the words of our great national motto, In God We Trust
trump, We stand on the shoulders of American Patriots who built this country into the greatest nation ever to exist in history
trump, Our ancestors crossed the oceans, settled a continent, tamed the wilderness, revolutionized industry, pioneered science, won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and put a man on the face of the moon
trump, Proud citizens like the people of Minnesota helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country
trump, We are returning power to you, the American people
trump, With your help, your devotion, your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning, winning
trump, We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God
trump, America is thriving like never before
trump, And ladies and gentlemen of Minnesota, I will tell you this with great certainty, the best is yet to come
trump, Thank you very much
trump, And just in concluding, together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again
trump, Thank you, Minnesota
trump, Thank you
trump,
trump,Thank you, thank you very much
trump, Thank you very much
trump, That is a beautiful site right behind me, isn't it That's a beautiful site
trump, Thank you very much
trump, And a very big hello, Wisconsin, we've been very good together
trump, And I'm thrilled to be with thousands of loyal, hard-working American patriots
trump, 47 days from now, we're going to win Wisconsin and we're going to win four more years in the White House
trump, This is the most important election in the history of our country
trump, I feel that way so strongly, so do you
trump, Joe Biden devoted his entire career to offshoring Wisconsin jobs, outsourcing your factories, throwing open your borders, dragging us into endless ridiculous foreign wars and surrendering your children's future to China
trump, You know what he's been doing I just see he's up there tonight getting softball questions from Anderson Cooper
trump, They don't ask me questions like that
trump, And the audience isn't quite like this
trump, Do you see what his audience … they've got cars
trump, They have car in a parking, it's the weirdest thing I've ever seen
trump, And CNN is going, Oh, this is so beautiful
trump, It's not beautiful
trump, They have cars in a parking lot
trump, What a deal, I'll tell you, what a deal
trump, Biden's supported every disasterous global sellout for half a century, including a NAFTA, China
trump, You take a look at China's entry into the World Trade Organization and TPP
trump, He supported them all, Biden, surrendered your jobs to China and you know that
trump, I probably wouldn't be here if it weren't for that, it was one of the big things, one of the big reasons I decided to say to my great wife, our first lady, let's go have some fun
trump, Let's go have some fun
trump, She's done a great job and very popular
trump, And the family is all over the place, all over the country
trump, But unlike Joe, who lets you down when he'd never even came back to Milwaukee to apologize or just to pay respects, I came to Wisconsin and I've been here a lot since, since we started this, a lot
trump, And you've been a tremendous beneficiary of what I've done and I have to, because you've been with me, you've supported me and we've had great victories together, all victories, so I want to thank you
trump, Now Biden wants to surrender our country to the violent left-wing mob
trump, You see what's happening
trump, If Biden wins very simple, China wins
trump, If Biden wins, the mob wins
trump, If Biden wins, the rioters, anarchists, arsonists, and flag burners, they win and we're not into flag burners
trump, We don't like flag burners
trump, I'd like to say, pass a law, one year in jail, you started burning flags, we put you in jail for a year
trump, We should do that
trump, They would have done that, it's a different world, I guess, but it's sort of coming back to the way we have to have it because we're for law and order
trump, They say, don't use that term, it's too tough
trump, No, everybody wants law and order
trump, Minorities want law and order
trump, Everybody wants law and order
trump, They have to have it
trump, I'm running for the reelection and a very important reelection to bring jobs in factories back and that's a continuation
trump, Because I don't know if you know it, the single greatest year Wisconsin has ever had was last year
trump, The second best year that Wisconsin has ever had was the year before
trump, And guess what the third was the year before that And you're going to have your best year economically next year, it's all heading in that direction despite the pandemic given to us by China
trump, We want to put the violent criminals behind bars and we have to ensure the future belongs to America, not to China, not to other very terrible forces out there, because if we win, very simply America wins
trump, And that's what we want, we want this great country to win
trump, Over the last three and a half years, we've secured America's borders
trump, Fixed the disastrous trade deals, they have been the worst ever
trump, Not even … it was not even … when I looked at these, I studied them and I used to talk about them, they had to be bad
trump, When I started studying, I said, Who are the people that made these deals2 Grossly incompetent people
trump, Brought back our manufacturing jobs, rebuilt the awesome power of the U
trump,S
trump, military and obliterated the ISIS caliphate
trump, We open obliterated it
trump, Obama was not able to do it, he wasn't able to come close
trump, It was just announced that in 2019, before the virus came in from China, we grew median income by a record of 4,400 in just one year, achieving the highest median income in U
trump,S
trump, history
trump, That's in the history of our country
trump, In the first three years, we lifted six point six million people out of poverty, the largest poverty reduction of any president in the history of our country
trump, That's not bad
trump, And I didn't even make these numbers up
trump, These are numbers that … they sound good to me
trump, We built the greatest economy in the history of a world
trump, This is the greatest economy in the history of the world
trump, And then the virus came in, we closed it down, we saved millions and millions of lives
trump, We'd be at two and a half million, two million, three million
trump, A number that would not be sustainable, would not be acceptable
trump, A horrible number, there shouldn't have been one person that died
trump, It should have been stopped at China
trump, They stopped it for their country, but it came out to us, to Europe, to the rest of the world, 188 countries
trump, We will deliver a safe and effective vaccine before the end of the year
trump, And it could be very, very soon
trump, You've been seeing what's going … could be very, very soon
trump, Could be, it's amazing how all of a sudden they hate the vaccine
trump, When they thought it couldn't be done, they said, Well, he's got to get a vaccine
trump, And then all of a sudden, they're looking like it's going to be very close
trump, We're doing great
trump, We're doing great with vaccines and therapeutics, Remdesivir, all sorts of other things that are bringing the rates down, like at numbers that nobody can believe
trump, But we have three vaccines right now, they're in the final stage, clinical trials
trump, We worked it for the FDA where they approved it fast
trump, They went very fast, very quick, at levels that nobody else could have ever achieved
trump, No other administration, certainly the last one, because the last one was grossly incompetent
trump, In fact, that's why I'm here, because if it was good, I wouldn't have run
trump, If they did their job, I wouldn't have run
trump, I was very happy in my other life
trump, I was very happy, but I'm very happy in this life
trump, More happy, because nobody has produced in three and a half years, the first three and a half years, nobody has done what we have been able to do, nobody
trump, So we'll defeat the virus and next year will be truly, I think, from an economic standpoint and from other standpoints, maybe the best year of all
trump, Hard to believe we're going so fast, the numbers have been incredible
trump, We've had employment numbers, the best ever
trump, We've had retail sales numbers the best ever
trump, You see them all, they come out every day
trump, And our stock market is for the most part, at a new high
trump, And if people have 401ks, if you want to have your 401k go down like to depression levels, I think you should vote for sleepy Joe, because he's going to raise your interest
trump, He'll be raising your interest rates
trump, I watch him though, he's denying all this up
trump, Everything that he said, he's now denying
trump, He said, no fracking, right There will be no fracking during the … he didn't know what fracking was, but he said there's no fracking
trump, The reason is because everybody else, all of the radical left candidates up there, they couldn't get too far left, so Joe agreed
trump, Then he gets the nomination, now they're all angry
trump, You know that crazy Bernie, all of the left democrats, they don't want to vote for him anymore because he made promises and now all of a sudden he forgot that he said no fracking
trump, He said, Well, now we can do some fracking
trump, But remember this in politics, it's always the thing that they say first, that's what they're going to do
trump, No guns, no religion, no energy, no oil, remember that
trump, Remember, he put Beto in charge of his gun policy, right Beto, crazy Beto
trump, Remember when Beto went out, he said, I was born for this
trump, And that's when it all came down
trump, As soon as I heard that, anybody said they were born for this, that doesn't play well
trump, But he's in charge of the Second Amendment
trump, And you won't have a Second Amendment
trump, Frankly, you wouldn't have a Second Amendment if I didn't get elected, it would have been obliterated
trump, It would have been torn up
trump, Maybe it would have been totally knocked out
trump, But there's tremendous pressure on your Second Amendment
trump, As long as I'm here, you'll always have a Second Amendment
trump, But I want to just say, they do disinformation, they make up a phony story and then they go with it
trump, They make up a totally phony story
trump, It's called disinformation
trump, And one of the things, oh, what they did, the worst of all was the soldiers
trump, Because, nobody loves our soldiers like I do and they made up a phony deal
trump, And that's why I say the gloves are off because when they do that, that's worse than what I'm going to talk to you about, that's big 10
trump, You know we got it back, right We got big 10
trump, But the soldier story, about standing over their graves, you know the one I'm talking about, then they do a commercial
trump, And I said, the good news about that is the gloves are off
trump, I can now call him grossly incompetent, the man is incompetent
trump, He's been there for 47 years, he didn't do a thing
trump, Now all of a sudden, in years where he was never considered smart, but now he's really not considered smart
trump, And now all of a sudden he's going to do what he never did in 47 years
trump, He's got to do this and that and everything that I'm doing, everything that we're doing
trump, But I want to congratulate the big 10 conference on yesterday's announcement that the fall season will start very soon
trump, Oh, I hope your team does well after all that
trump, I hope that team does well
trump, But I especially want to thank a football legend, he was great
trump, Wisconsin's own Barry Alvarez, he was great
trump, Good, got to be careful when you do that, a lot of times you don't like people too much
trump, They say, Oh, but he's a good man
trump, We worked with him
trump, We worked with a whole group, including the commissioner of the league, did a very, very good job, did a very good job
trump, But we called them, and the reason is that they took an ad
trump, In other words, another one, disinformation
trump, They took an ad saying I was against football
trump, I'm the one that said they shouldn't close
trump, But I said that, if they close, they close
trump, But then they took an ad saying I'm the one, I didn't want it
trump, I wanted it closed
trump, So then I said, Well, no, I don't
trump, I want it open
trump, Let me call up the commissioner
trump, We called up the commissioner and he was great
trump, He said, You really think so And bottom line, we worked very hard, lots of calls to lots of different states, lots of people
trump, We dealt with the players, the parents of the players, who are really the boss, that's okay, I won't say that
trump, But these are players that have a shot at the NFL
trump, They have a shot at pro-football
trump, We want the NFL to proudly stand when they sing our National Anthem
trump, Or their ratings are going to continue to go down like they did last weekend, down 27
trump, Because people don't want that
trump, You know what, we have enough politics, right We have politics here
trump, We have politics all over
trump, In fact, sometimes I have to turn it off
trump, I can't do it anymore
trump, I can't watch me
trump, It's always … I can't watch me
trump, I can't watch
trump, But no, we have enough politics
trump, We don't want to watch now on Sunday, all, here we go again with the politics, let them play football, let them stand and salute or put your hand on your heart and be proud of our country and be proud of our great American flag
trump, And then go home to the mansion and have a good time
trump, Take a nice sauna and then if you want, after you recover, you come out and you go and you do your thing, whatever the thing may be
trump, But people don't want to see it and the ratings are down
trump, Here we go again
trump, I thought we taught them that lesson two years ago
trump, Didn't we think I thought we taught that lesson
trump, But Biden would absolutely eradicate your state's economy
trump, I know this state very well
trump, It's one of the reasons I made the great deal with Canada and Mexico, but Canada, because they were taking advantage of you so badly on your dairy products
trump, You had a 287 tariff on your dairy products with Canada
trump, People don't realize Canada is one of the toughest negotiators and they treated your state and this country very unfairly until I came along, very, very unfairly
trump, Did you know that 287
trump, But I saw some farmers and this was like the straw that broke the camel's back
trump, They had something called specialty milk
trump, Does anybody know what that is Right, you know
trump, A lot of people … it's a small little grouping of milks, specialty milk
trump, But this was the final straw
trump, And I met some people and Canada finally did it to them like they did it to everybody else
trump, And they raised a tariffs massively, they made it impossible
trump, They tried to take over that business too, along with all of them, it was just massive and horrible what they did
trump, And that really got me going, the little specialty milk, specialty products, a small portion, but you know what, that was it
trump, And we have a great deal
trump, The USMCA is a great deal and I'm very honored to have done it
trump, But it was all because of specialty milk and the way you were taken advantage of by Canada
trump, You know, they have the wonderful, Oh, Canada, we love to hear the song, right But let me tell you, they are very tough
trump, And they've taken advantage of our country for many, many years
trump, And I will tell you this, they're not so happy now, but at least they got a deal, but you're happy
trump, And it's about time you were happy
trump, You now have a great deal and you're not going to have your companies leaving for Mexico anymore or Canada
trump, And you're not going to have them make your product in Mexico or Canada, send it over here with no tariff, with no tax
trump, Where we lose tax, we lose jobs, we lose our companies, we lose everything
trump, And they make a lot of money selling the product to us, same product
trump, So we're not doing that stuff anymore
trump, There's a tremendous disincentive, it's called, like, let's not do it
trump, And you haven't seen that lately
trump, You haven't seen too many companies leaving have you It's sort of an amazing thing
trump, It's a little bit like what we did with the statues
trump, So on the statutes, they were knocking them down three or four months ago
trump, I said, Do we have any laws No, but there was a very old law
trump, I said, What was it You get 10 years in jail, 10 years in prison, they actually use the word prison, which is a tough word
trump, You get 10 years in prison if you knocked down a statue or a monument
trump, I said, Let me see that law, I want to see that law
trump, Right, Glen, right I want to see that law
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you very much
trump, So big tax cuts, big regulation cuts
trump, The Democrats, they want to … the Democrats, they want to just really break us down in terms of our competitive ability to compete with other nations
trump, Do you notice what's happening with Japan You notice what's … We have taken billions and billions of dollars in from China
trump, We charge them a fortune
trump, In fact, many farmers in this group, because you got to love Trump
trump, I gave you 28 billion, right Thank you very much, China, right You were targeted
trump, 12 billion, Sonny Purdue, Secretary of Agriculture
trump, I said, Sonny, how much have they been hit for, targeted for Remember when China said we're not going to do anything, we're not buying
trump, They thought they were going to put pressure on us
trump, Sonny said, Sir, 12 billion, the year before last and last year was 16, total of 28 billion
trump, We took 28 billion out of the tariffs
trump, China never paid us 25 cents, not 25 cents with Obama and Biden
trump, And in all fairness with no president, they paid us nothing
trump, They pay us now tens of billions of dollars
trump, I took a small portion of it, I added it up, 16 and 12, 28, and I said, 28 billion is going to the farmers
trump, Did everybody get that money, right You had a very good year, the farmers have had a very good year
trump, Last week, China ordered and you have to understand, I view China differently now than I did six months ago, we made a great trade deal but I view it differently because I don't know if I can ever view it the same
trump, But last week they know how I feel and they're very smart
trump, So instead of saying, we're not going to do business, which would have been okay with me
trump, We would have worked it out somehow, you would have been very successful, the farmers
trump, But last week, they had the largest order of corn
trump, Did you know this In the history of our country
trump, Did anyone know this, the farmers From China, thank you very much
trump, The largest order of soybeans in the history of our country
trump, And one of the largest cattle orders in the history of our country, because they're very smart
trump, Somebody else would have said, well, let's not do business
trump, And then it would have been easy for me, but they gave us so much
trump, I have every farmer calling up saying, please do me a favor
trump, We love this
trump, We love this
trump, This is a great deal
trump, It's a great deal, but we feel differently about it, don't we We just feel differently about it
trump, I don't talk about it like I used to, I talked about it, it was great
trump, And it turned out to be a great deal, but I don't talk about it the same way
trump, At no time before has there been a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies or two agendas for the future than these two parties, you got law and order on one side and you have chaos on the other
trump, On November 3rd, Wisconsin will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity or whether we will allow Biden and the Democrats to impose a four trillion dollar tax hike, ban American energy, confiscate your guns, which is what they want to do
trump, Shut down the economy, destroy the suburbs
trump, You know they were destroying our suburbs, you know that, right I don't know, if somebody said, you just doing okay in the suburbs I said, How can I do okay, I saved the suburbs
trump, What I've done is saved the suburbs
trump, And you know this, I don't have to go into it, but I saved the suburbs
trump, I think the suburbs … Last time, four years ago, Oh, he's not going to do well with women
trump, I did great with women
trump, They said, Well a big thing
trump, Remember that
trump, No, but was that one of the greatest evenings ever, remember And remember all the fake news, look at all the … Oh la, that's a lot
trump, That's a lot of people back there
trump, Look at that, the red lights are on
trump, Don't worry, I won't say anything bad about you CNN
trump, Because as soon as I see, as soon as I- Because as soon as I see … As soon as I'm getting ready to say something about fake news, et cetera, et cetera, the lights start going off so I'm not going to … One just went off I think
trump, You can tell by the lights, they got that little beautiful red light
trump, You see it But I won't say anything bad about them but they are fakers and do you remember when they … Remember when they were saying that the polls are terrible
trump, Actually these polls are very good compared … That was so bad it was like why did anybody vote
trump, They're called suppression polls
trump, They make them so bad that you lose all your appetite, you lose all your spirit, they take your guts out, and you don't go and vote, and your wife looks at you and says, Darling I love that guy, but he's not going to win
trump, He doesn't have a chance because the polls, he's down 10, he's down 20, he's down 50 points, darling
trump, He can't possibly win
trump, Let's go have dinner and then we'll come home and watch his concession speech
trump, But my people didn't buy that because my people went out to vote
trump, Instead, we watched her concession speech
trump, Crooked Hillary, that was a real piece of work
trump, Remember when she was saying, Will you accept the decision of the voters Will you accept that decision I wasn't perfect, I said I'll see how it works out
trump, I should have said, Yes, I will, but I couldn't do that because I know how crooked she is
trump, Would you accept the decision The anchor said to me like, Will you accept They're coming after me, I said, You're supposed to be going after her a little bit too
trump, Did you ever see debates where you had all of the anchors plus the candidates against me Here we sit, is that Air Force One, yes, that's Air Force One
trump, How did that happen A lot of the times I'd say to the anchor, I'd say, Wait a minute
trump, Wait a minute
trump, This isn't fair
trump, I mean I'm watching what they're doing with Biden where he's using teleprompters, Move it up, move it up, I can't see, I can't see
trump, He's shot
trump, He's shot
trump, President Xi of China is not shot
trump, Putin is not shot
trump, Kim Jong-un, remember we're supposed to be in a war with him, what happened to the war No, it seems to be good
trump, Did you see the Middle East two days ago Remember our incompetent negotiator John Kerry He never got up to walk
trump, The guy's getting beaten on every point, I say, Walk
trump, Walk
trump, Get up and leave the table
trump, You're giving up
trump, They'd say, We want this
trump, He'd say, Well, I'd rather not
trump, We want this
trump, Okay, you got it
trump, We want that
trump, You got it
trump, We want that
trump, Say no and walk
trump, They'll probably possibly call you back and if they don't that's okay too
trump, But right now I will tell you Iran, if we win, Iran will be calling us within the first week, they're dying to make a deal
trump, GDP down 27
trump, They don't have too much money for terror anymore, it's actually amazing, do you notice what's going on Now I don't want to speak too loud, but I did put out on social media the other day that if they hit us in any way, any form, written instructions already done, we're going to hit them 1000 times harder than we've ever hit them before
trump, So hopefully they will just come and we'll make a deal and they'll go back to being a rich country, let them go back and be rich but they cannot have a nuclear weapon
trump, They cannot
trump, That deal was so bad that Obama made
trump, 150 billion, they got 150 billion for nothing
trump, You know the deal is practically … If I didn't terminate it which I'm proud to have done, but if I didn't terminate it, they got 1
trump,8 billion in cash, how about that If I didn't terminate that stupid deal, first of all you wouldn't have the deal in the Middle East and all these countries are joining, it's happening fast
trump, They want to all join
trump, We did it, you know, the reverse
trump, We did it the … Thank you very much
trump, Thank you very much
trump, You know it's interesting, thank you very much
trump, I knew I like you
trump, So the Nobel Peace Prize
trump, So the funny thing, a lot of people don't know because the fake news doesn't write about it
trump, So if you're a president, right And you are nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, you're the United States, no, but think of this
trump, That's a big deal
trump, I mean Obama got it like in his first couple of weeks and nobody knew why he got it including him, remember He couldn't tell you why
trump, He had no idea
trump, To this day, he has no idea why he got it
trump, But if you're a president and you get nominated, then two days later, you get nominated, did you know this, a second time, for a different deal
trump, Kosovo
trump, Serbia
trump, They've been killing each other for hundreds of years
trump, I stopped a lot of death and I did it like easy, it wasn't hard for me
trump, It's sort of a natural thing to do but we did a good thing
trump, But you know what They did a check
trump, So I got nominated twice for the Nobel Peace Prize, that's a big deal, I don't know
trump, I should have gotten nominated seven times because we did a lot of other things, but these are for two different deals, and not one mention was made on the evening news
trump, Think of it
trump, I got rid of the prosecutor, here's the billion, right But they don't want to play that too often
trump, You have to look around for it
trump, It's a very unfair deal but as the expression goes, we won, I don't know how the hell we did it
trump, When you look at the opposition, when you look at how unfair it is and these guys know very well, you look at how unfair it is, it's pretty damn good, but we have a lot of support
trump, We have tremendous support of the people
trump, These rallies, look at this rally
trump, These rallies … These rallies are incredible gap ever polled
trump, I'm not a believer in the polls but I believe that one
trump, It's the biggest enthusiasm gap, he's got no enthusiasm
trump, The only enthusiasm is for the people that want to beat us, they want to beat me
trump, That's the only thing he's got, the people that want to … They couldn't care less about him
trump, He could be that piece of wood that was left in the ground
trump, Biden will hand the left wing mob the keys to your kids' classroom
trump, Earlier today I took a historic stand against the hateful lies being fed to America's youth, the parents know all about it
trump, I checked, they're doing it in Wisconsin too
trump, I was a little surprised, I'm a little surprised
trump, I'm a little surprised you let it happen actually but we're going to get rid of it
trump, I announced that we're launching a new pro-American lesson plan for students called 1776 Commission
trump, We're going to teach our children the truth about America, that we're the most exceptional nation ever to exist and we're getting better every single day
trump, Sleepy Joe Biden is wholly owned and controlled by the far left
trump, He even opposed sending the National Guard into a place called Kenosha, did you ever hear of Kenosha How about that, did we do a good job I wish we did it a little sooner but we finally got your governor's okay
trump, We have to do that if … We got to get the governors to say please do it
trump, How they don't do it, how they don't do it in some other places when you look at what's going on with Chicago, right When you look at what's going on with Portland, those are just anarchists
trump, You know how long it would take us to fix up Portland in terms of ending it all I'd say far less than an hour, I'd say a half hour
trump, Look what we did at Minneapolis
trump, We're doing well in Minnesota because they saw what happened
trump, Now they shouldn't have allowed it to go on for 11 days, they should have called us immediately but do you remember that beautiful night Nice evening, a little problem, there were a lot of buildings in the background that were burning down to the ground as reporters said, No, this is a peaceful protest
trump, I don't know if it's your state but a couple of them they have … You're allowed to protest, so you can't go to church but you can rip the hell out of the streets, of Main Street, of 5th Avenue, break up the stores
trump, Burn down the buildings
trump, Climb over each other's face, you can climb right over their face
trump, You don't have to wear masks, you don't have to do anything
trump, 25,000 people walking down the street, looters, anarchists, agitators, burning down stores, throwing things at police
trump, They've taken the authority away from our police, our great police
trump, They've taken their authority and their dignity away
trump, We're giving it back, we have to, we have to
trump, By the way, I was endorsed by New York's finest and we're with them all the way
trump, I was just endorsed two days ago by Chicago Police
trump, I think that takes courage, right Philadelphia, Florida, Texas, everybody, Ohio
trump, I don't know, did anybody … Is there one group of … Even if it was a tiny little group of two or three police, did anybody endorse Sleepy Joe I don't think so
trump, But we did a great job in Kenosha
trump, We got out there, I went there as you know, a little while ago but had we not gone in that place would … It would have been burned to the ground
trump, They did damage, we should have gone in
trump, I wanted to go in the first night, we would have stopped it immediately but it was a great outcome as was in Minnesota
trump, Again, if they would have called us early it would have been over
trump, Portland, I'd love to go there
trump, That would be so easy
trump, You know in Seattle, they heard we were coming in, they gave up
trump, They heard we … I said, That's enough
trump, We're going in
trump, I don't care
trump, We're going in
trump, Do you have permission
trump, No, we're going in
trump, They took over a chunk of the city, and when they heard we were going in it's like, Well we give up, that's it
trump, That was the end of the Settle problem
trump, It's a terrible thing that's going on
trump, All in Democratic run, super liberal run, cities
trump, The red cities are doing great
trump, I think we're doing great all over, the Republican cities, we're fair
trump, We're not stupid
trump, How stupid these people are
trump, Did you see Chicago 48 people shot, six died
trump, You know we're in Afghanistan, we're pulling the troops, you know that, we're coming back, we're almost finished
trump, We're pulling … Finally, these endless wars
trump, These endless wars, and we had to fight other things but we've done a great job but we're acting like a police force over there
trump, No, we're pulling the troops, we're almost out of Iraq
trump, That's another one, we're down to about 2,000 troops, did you know that Sean 2,000 troops
trump, So Syria, we're out but we kept the oil so we have some … Was it okay that we at least kept the oil I feel badly because we have some troops … Well you haven't pulled the troops
trump, No no, we're gone, we pulled all the troops out of Syria
trump, Remember we were supposed to be guarding the border between Syria and Turkey I said, Why are we doing that They said, Well, we are
trump, I said, Wait a minute, we have an army of 100,000 here, an army of 25,000, 30,000 here
trump, We got 5,000 soldiers
trump, That's a very dangerous position to be in
trump, I don't like it
trump, They've been guarding their own borders with different names for a thousand years
trump, Why the hell do we have to be over there guarding their border We want to guard our own borders, right, where we're doing very well
trump, Where we're doing very well
trump, We're doing great on our southern border, I hate to say this, but that wall is going up very rapidly, 10 miles a week
trump, We're up to 330 miles and the wall will be finished very soon
trump, You think that was easy, that was not easy, our great congressman over here, that was not easy
trump, The Democrats were totally in favor of the wall until I said when I came in, We will build the wall
trump, As soon as I said it, they were against the wall
trump, They said, We don't want you to build the wall
trump, Walls don't work
trump, I said, No no, walls always work
trump, You know what else works The wheel
trump, The wheel and the wall, you can go back
trump, Come back in 1,000 years from now
trump, The only two things I know for sure, you're going to have a wheel and you're going to have a wall
trump, The computers, they come up with a brand new computer, it's genius, 12 days later, it's obsolete
trump, But walls are never obsolete, neither are wheels
trump, So I made one mistake and I tell this to these guys because they were great warriors for me, the congressmen
trump, They were incredible actually
trump, I tell it to them
trump, I should have said instead of we will build the wall, we will build the wall, we will build … Then the Democrats held us up and fought us and sued us and everything else and now we won so many lawsuits on the wall and we had the military money, I can build like 10 walls with all the money we have
trump, It's the craziest thing
trump, Maybe we'll build it double thick or we'll go twice as high
trump, No, but the wall is great
trump, Everything, everything, that they wanted, but I made one mistake
trump, I should have said, We will not build a wall
trump, Then they would have insisted that we build it, I could have saved two years of litigation
trump, We will not build a wall under any circumstances
trump, Then Pelosi would say, We demand that you build a wall
trump, These people are terrible
trump, Crazy Nancy, crazy as a bedbug
trump, She's crazy as a bedbug
trump, She decided to make a nice little stop-in at the beauty parlor, how did that work out Not too good, it didn't work out too well
trump, Can you imagine The owner of the beauty parlor is a MAGA lady, she loves Trump
trump, Can you believe it I don't know what it is but I think if I owned a beauty parlor, I had a customer, I'm not sure I'd be turning her in
trump, The owner turned Nancy in
trump, That's a lot of hate
trump, That's serious hate, right No, she's a great owner
trump, As far as I'm concerned, I think she's fantastic
trump, She's for us
trump, They said, What made you do it You know what she said, Because I see how hard our president has to work
trump, I see what they put him through
trump, I see what he puts with and I turned her in
trump, How about that How about that We love her
trump, She can do my hair anytime
trump, I think I'm going to call her in
trump, Check it out, maybe you can do something
trump, Maybe you can improve it, it's not bad though
trump, I have friends that … I have friends my age, they're not looking too good
trump, Instead of standing up for America, Joe Biden and the Democrats, they condemn America and war is always waged on our great law enforcement
trump, We love our law enforcement
trump, Kamala Harris, that's another great beauty, Kamala Harris, that's a beauty
trump, Remember, I tell this story all the time
trump, When you pick somebody, you pick somebody that's hot, that's going in the right direction, right She came out, she was at like 14, 15 in the polls, and she started going down, down, down, it never stopped
trump, It drove her crazy
trump, She was terrible at the debates
trump, Wait till you see what … I don't want to put pressure on him but wait till you see what Mike Pence does to her in the debates, but I don't want to put … I don't want to put pressure on Mike
trump, Do we have a great vice president Is he good He's great, and he loves this state
trump, Loves all the states actually
trump, He's just a great American but do you remember his last debate What he did to that character from Virginia That one wasn't good
trump, The other guy's jumping around, Mike is just sitting there, we love America, we're going to lower your taxes
trump, Thank you, you win
trump, No, Mike is great
trump, But Kamala Harris and 13 members of Biden's staff urged their supporters to donate to a fund to bail out rioters, take them out of jail, get them out of jail as soon as possible
trump, Including one who attempted to murder a police officer, a man who was accused of sexually assaulting an eight-year-old girl
trump, This is what we're dealing with
trump, This is what we're dealing with
trump, You know Kamala was considered, is considered further left than Crazy Bernie, think of that
trump, They got there … I mean seriously, watch
trump, You know the manifesto that Biden and … It's not Biden, Biden has not agreed to anything
trump, His people, his representatives, because Biden doesn't know he's alive, let's not kid ourselves
trump, Biden
trump, Biden didn't agree, he didn't, they just told him what's happening
trump, They said, Listen, you're against fracking but now you have to be in favor of fracking because you lucked out
trump, Elizabeth Warren decided not to drop out and when she stayed, Pocahontas, you know Pocahontas Did anybody ever hear of her She's another great one
trump, Pocahontas
trump, I said to her a long time ago, I've got more Indian blood in me than you do and I have none, I have none
trump, Sadly
trump, I'd love a little bit of it, but I have none, I said … I turned out to be right
trump, She choked and she went for a blood test
trump, Remember Was it 1024th Meaning maybe nine hundred years ago, there was a little action going on
trump, Crazy Pocahontas, she's a nasty one though, isn't she She's a terrible person
trump, I was hoping that she'd win so we could go after her because I think Kamala is not as smart but she's a little bit less vicious
trump, I think this
trump, The one who treated Sleepy Joe the worst was Kamala
trump, She accused him of MeToo, she accused him of everything
trump, She accused him of … That he was a racist, right That he was a racist Because what he's done to the black population of this country was a terrible thing
trump, She's accused him of everything under the book, the busing, remember, the busing scandal
trump, So I said brilliantly he'll never pick her because she was too terrible to him
trump, She was the worst of everybody
trump, By far, I would say, but she picked him and hopefully that's going to be history, it's not going to matter, and that is no way for a woman to become the first president, that's for sure
trump, If a woman is going to become the first president of the United States, it can't be her
trump, That would rip our country apart
trump, This is not what people want and she comes in through the backdoor, this would not be what people want, especially because it's her
trump, Biden has called to end cash bail, you know that right, for vicious criminals Meaning if you assault a copy or anybody else, you're right back on the street the next day
trump, He called for police and he calls them all the time the enemy
trump, He says they're the enemy and he just thinks it's terrible
trump, He think it's terrible
trump, Now he's liking the police much more
trump, It's a little late
trump, Remember, first instinct, that's where they're going, and he has no choice because he has to, because again, I was going to say, the radical left hates him because they think he deceived them because they agreed on that manifesto and that manifesto is seriously a leftist dream and he agreed from the Green New Deal, getting rid of your planes
trump, No more airplane trips
trump, Remember the crazy senator from Hawaii Do you like the Green New Deal I love it very much, he said
trump, Oh okay, well you're the senator from Hawaii, that's right, the beautiful island of Hawaii
trump, She said, Under the Green New Deal you basically can't fly in an airplane
trump, Oh that's a problem
trump, So they said they'd build a bridge from the mainland to Hawaii
trump, It's 2,000 miles long but these are minor details
trump, Remember her when they explained to her that planes are out, cows are out
trump, Cows, they don't want cattle, they don't want cows
trump, Did they withdraw that one That was a tough one, wasn't it They don't want cows, bad for the ozone layer
trump, Who would even think of that You'd got to be sick to even think it, okay Give me a break
trump, Give me a break and I guess under that theory this big guy is next, he's next
trump, No, it's a sick deal going on there
trump, To do it the way they want would cost 100 trillion
trump, That's more money than this country could earn in 1,000 years to do it right
trump,  We don't like that building, the windows are too large
trump, Okay, let's rip it down and build a new one
trump, What windows are you going to have You're not going to have windows anymore
trump, Environmental
trump, They love wind too, right The big windmills, I always say, the greatest graveyard in the world for birds, just walk under a windmill
trump, You will see more dead birds than you will ever imagine, what's happening, including eagles
trump, You know, in California they put you in jail if you shoot a bald eagle, right You go to jail, right These windmills are knocking them out of the sky all day long
trump, It's unbelievable, and yet they want wind, and wind also is very, it's very hard to store the electricity from wind
trump, So if you go home and you want to watch television because President Trump is on and you want to watch one of his very brilliant State of the Union addresses, if the wind isn't blowing, the husband looks at the wife, says, Darling, I'm sorry, you can't watch tonight
trump, The wind is not blowing
trump, Sorry, you can't watch tonight
trump, The wind is not blowing
trump, And she looks at me, I like the old days
trump, It's much better
trump, But the rhetoric of Biden and the radical left puts your law enforcement in serious danger
trump, Last weekend, two Los Angeles sheriff's deputies were ambushed and shot at point blank range
trump, And we have everybody looking for that creep that did it
trump, I called him an animal the other night
trump, I said, He's an animal, and we were challenged by some people on the left
trump, He's not an animal
trump, He's a human being
trump, He's not a human being
trump, They got to find him
trump, They got to find him
trump, And the penalty has to be very fast, very swift and very, very severe
trump, You can't do that
trump, We call for the death penalty if you kill a policeman
trump, You know that, right But the anti police demonstrators, they cheered and cheered when they saw this
trump, And then they tried to stop them from even getting into the hospital
trump, As president, I'll always support the heroes of law enforcement and I'll fight to ensure that criminals who murder police officers do indeed get the death penalty
trump, They want prisoners to vote too, they wanted to
trump, I said, So what about the Boston bomber Remember Bernie Sanders He wanted all prisoners to have
trump, And I said, Does that mean everybody Yes
trump, So we sent in a question, Does that include the Boston bomber Is he entitled to a vote And even Bernie is going, Oh man, let's get into a different question
trump, This is not a good question
trump, But we want to get that, we want to take care of it
trump, If you look at all of the problems that we have, you look at crime, even somebody brought it up today, we're doing a great job relative to other countries on the coronavirus
trump, You know how many names we have Like 22 different names
trump, I call it the China virus
trump, We're doing a great job
trump, But if you want to really see a great job, take New York and some of these other Democrat run states out of it
trump, You'll see numbers that are unbelievable because New York had a very, very hard time
trump, A lot of bad things happened
trump, But you take a few of the states out and you'll really see numbers
trump, But by comparison to other countries and by almost all metrics, we've done an incredible job, including the job of helping the world with ventilators and all of the things that we built
trump, And I think our task force has been incredible
trump, And Mike Pence has done a great job
trump, Biden opposes the death penalty for cop killers or mass murderers
trump, Biden says he wants to protect black lives, but his radical platform will cut short the lives of thousands of African American citizens
trump, The Democrat party's war on cops has already led to surging homicides in Democrat controlled cities
trump, Yet Biden supports imposing these failed policies nationwide
trump, They ask him, What about nationwide What about the fact that you just had your Democrat national convention Where, by the way, we had far many more viewers, millions and millions of more viewers
trump, We had millions of more
trump, I thought it was a great thing
trump, Did anybody hear Herschel Walker that night It was … well
trump, You talk about a good football player
trump, He was some player
trump, What a great guy
trump, But all of them, everybody
trump, The first lady did great, Ivanka did great
trump, They all did, they did great
trump, We had some … and some incredible stories, some very sad stories when you look and see what happened
trump, But Biden's plan is to appease the domestic terrorists
trump, My plan is to arrest the domestic terrorists
trump, Joe Biden is a weak person
trump, He's always been a weak person
trump, And that was in prime time
trump, And prime time was 25 years ago
trump, And let me tell you, he's not old
trump, I always defend him on this
trump, I have friends that are 85, 89, 92, 95, and they're 100
trump, There's just something wrong with Joe
trump, He's off, okay He's off, and I have no problem saying it anymore when I watch the disinformation, because this is not disinformation
trump, This is fact
trump, If he's elected, his radical supporters won't just be causing mayhem on the streets, they'll be running the Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Education
trump, And most importantly, they will put many judges on the United States Supreme Court
trump, We can't have that
trump, We'll have a totally different country radical left judges
trump, And that has to do with the Second Amendment
trump, It has to do with right to life, it has to do with so many different things that will turn your world upside down
trump, And they'll have one, two, three or four, whoever is the next president
trump, And hopefully, that's going to be us
trump, Not me, us
trump, It's us
trump, But I put it, and think of this, by the end of the term, we'll have approximately 300 brand new, great federal judges, Court of Appeals judges 300, which is a record, 300
trump, Give or take a little, tiny bit, but 300
trump, Nobody thought that was possible
trump, I want to thank President Obama
trump, He left us 142 openings
trump, Nobody gets left one opening
trump, A federal judgeship is a big deal
trump, Nobody gets left any openings
trump, He gave us 142 openings
trump, Thank you very much
trump, What happened They thought Hillary was going to win, so they didn't push it
trump, And then they said, Wait a minute, these polls are getting a little close at the end
trump, And they tried like hell to get some judges approved, but it didn't work
trump, That's what happens
trump, You got to go and you have to act fast
trump, You got to get it done
trump, Get it done, right We get things done like nobody's ever gotten it
trump, Oh, he was a great president
trump, He was great
trump, He left 142 judges for the Republicans
trump, He was a great president, right If you are of that side of the plate of that ideology, and you had a president that left you 142 federal judgeships, I don't think you'd rate him as doing a good job
trump, Hey, look at what happened in Iraq, look at what happened with ISIS, look at what happened with our military, look at what happened with our vets
trump, Our vets are better taken care of now than they've ever been in the history of our country, but never forget they are coming after me because I am fighting for you
trump, And that's true
trump, That's true
trump, And we're winning the fight and we're winning this election
trump, This election, we are doing well
trump, They refuse to say it
trump, They refuse to say it, and they hate to say it
trump, It just drives them crazy
trump, But that night, remember they started off by saying, This will be a very short evening for Donald Trump
trump, That was Donald Trump in those days
trump, Now, it's President Trump
trump, I lost all my friends because of this position
trump, I had friends
trump, Hey, Don, let's go to dinner
trump, Okay
trump, Good, Richard
trump, I'll go
trump, Hey, Don, let's go
trump, Okay, Larry
trump, I'll see you later
trump, I'll meet you at a restaurant in New York
trump, Everybody was nice and loose
trump, You could have a great conversation, and you don't want to know what we talked about
trump, It's just none of your business, but we were loose
trump, All of a sudden, I'd become president of the United States
trump, And these are a lot of … I know a lot of important people
trump, Actually, the people I like the best are the people that are less successful because it makes you feel so powerful
trump, I always say, never go out with a successful person
trump, You'll understand
trump, But I know a lot of very successful people, very, very successful
trump, And now they call me up, Mr
trump, President, sir, would you like to get together sometime I say, Loosen up
trump, Yes, call me Donald
trump, You've known me for 30 years, call me Donald
trump, Oh, thank you so much
trump, Thank you, Mr
trump, President, I appreciate it
trump, I lost all my friends because it's respect for the office, let's face it
trump, It's different
trump, They used to be loose, they used to be great
trump, You could sit back, I'm not a drinker, but you could sit back and have a drink, whatever the hell you're drinking
trump, And now, you can't do that anymore
trump, You can't do it anymore
trump, So I have to rely on people in Congress to be my friends
trump, And we just happened to have a couple tonight
trump, And one of them who's been a great warrior and he's doing a fantastic job, I just saw you on television by the way, Bryan
trump, Does everybody know Bryan Steil Bryan Steil young, handsome, but a warrior
trump, When the fake impeachment happened, it was a total fake, what did we finish up with the Republicans 197 to nothing, right at the house
trump, One night, it was a fake impeachment
trump, I got impeached over a perfect phone call of congratulations to the president of Ukraine, who I never met before
trump, If you're going to do something, at least know him a little bit, right I never met him
trump, And then they said it was eight times, quid pro quo
trump, That was Adam Schiff
trump, Shifty Schiff, right And he went before Congress and he repeated my conversation, except that he made it all up
trump, Remember he repeated it And then I said, Ah, fortunately, we had that whole thing essentially recorded
trump, I'm glad I did, but these are very deceptive, deceiving, sick people
trump, And I said, Well, he lied because there was no quid pro quo
trump, It was a perfect conversation
trump, But by that time it was too late because they had already embarrassed themselves by doing it
trump, And Nancy Pelosi was all set
trump, She loved doing it, she from day one, but she thought it was what Schiff said
trump, When she saw the conversation, she said to her people, What the hell did you get me into So they could have dropped it, but they said, Let's give it a shot
trump, He's another beauty, Mitt Romney
trump, He's a real beauty
trump, He couldn't get elected dog catcher right now in Utah
trump, So we have another great one and he's really a friend of mine, and he's been solid
trump, He loves his country and he loves his state, Glenn Grothman
trump, Glenn, thank you very much, friend
trump, And a man who just got elected, and he's from an area that I know very well, we did very well, we got our big, big, fat, beautiful contract that produced lots of jobs
trump, But he was taking a legend's place, so it's never easy to replace a legend
trump, That's Duffy, in case anybody … And they was running and we did a lot of work for him, and it was great
trump, And he reacted very well under pressure
trump, A lot of people don't react well under pressure
trump, They choke, they choke
trump, He was under a lot of pressure and he ended up winning by like 18 points
trump, And now, he's your congressman
trump, He's doing a great job
trump, You got to vote for all these people on November 3rd, Tom Tiffany
trump, Thank you, Tom
trump, And we have a great congressional candidate, Derrick Van Orden
trump, Where's Derrick Derrick, good luck
trump, I hear good things, Derrick
trump, You got my total support
trump, I hear very good things
trump, I could only be supportive
trump, Our record is like 222 and three, so I don't like to have a loss
trump, And I support you a 100, you know that
trump, You have my total endorsement, all right I hear you're fantastic
trump, All right
trump, And your former congressman who I hope is making a lot of money in the private sector because he deserves it, especially his wife, Rachel deserves it, she's just fantastic
trump, He's fantastic because I know he's coming back into government in some form
trump, He can come with us
trump, He can stay here
trump, He can maybe run for governor or maybe do something, Sean Duffy
trump, Sean Duffy
trump, No, but he was the World Champion tree climber
trump, And I love sports, right Anytime you know the world champion at anything, but especially that, and I'll never forget
trump, I was asking about it
trump, How was it was He said, well, he broke his back numerous times
trump, He broke a lot of bones
trump, I said, Let me ask you a question
trump, How much harder was it to go up the tree than down He said, It was easy going up
trump, The hard part was coming down because if he missed, that was where the danger was, right That was where the danger
trump, But many times, world champion
trump, Could you still do it today A little bit heavier, he said
trump, You got to carry a little bit more weight
trump, That's all right
trump, That's not a good sign though, right Anyway, great job
trump, We love having you Rachel, thank you very much
trump, You are a friend
trump, Fox and friends, and plenty of other places, right A lot of personality, a lot of personality
trump, Rachel, she's been our friend from day one, I think from day one
trump, And her fantastic family too
trump, Tonight, we're also praying for everyone in the path of Hurricane Sally
trump, We're out there working very hard
trump, We are working in Florida and Alabama and Georgia
trump, We have FEMA
trump, We have everybody there
trump, We just finished in … take a look, we just went to Louisiana, Texas
trump, We're getting hit by some big hurricanes, but we have it under control
trump, Really good
trump, Our coast guard has been fantastic, by the way
trump, Unbelievable, the bravery
trump, They go into these storms
trump, They go into these storms
trump, They say, How dangerous is it Sir, it's very dangerous
trump, I say, Yeah
trump, All right
trump, He said, Would you like to try it sometime I say, Admiral, no, thank you
trump, I'll take a pass
trump, I think they might have a problem with me doing it, but I will tell you, they are … In Texas, they saved 16,000 people two years ago, the coast guard, US Coast Guard
trump, I think there's no brand to me, that's gone up more than the US Coast Guard
trump, So it's great that we're getting them new ships
trump, Those ships are all coming in
trump, Nice new ones, all built in the USA, beautiful ones
trump, Most of them have already arrived
trump, My administration will be by their side through every step
trump, We're working again, very, very hard in the Panhandle
trump, The Panhandle, we love the Panhandle
trump, It got hit hard
trump, We spent the last four years reversing the horrible damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years
trump, We passed record tax cuts and regulation cuts
trump, Nobody's ever done more, more than anybody else has ever done to keep our family farms in the family
trump, We've virtually eliminated the unfair estate tax, also known as the death tax
trump, So if you die in 100 years from now, and you have children who you love as opposed to children that you can stand … is anybody here they have children that they don't like, or perhaps can't stand Because if you do, don't listen to the rest of this
trump, But if you have a family that you love and you have a small business or farm or whatever, they were being put out of business
trump, They'd have to go and borrow the money to pay the estate tax, the death tax
trump, And it was a terrible thing
trump, We got rid of it, so now you can leave your farm, your small business to your family
trump, And just hope they remember you every once in a while
trump, It's always a difficult situation, but it was
trump, It was ruining farms
trump, They'd have to go out and sell the farm, they'd have to go out and get partnerships, they'd have to go out and borrow money from banks
trump, And then all of a sudden they're in foreclosure proceedings and they've never done that before
trump, They don't have to worry about that anymore
trump, If you love your family, that's a big deal
trump, They've been trying to get that, Sean, for what, 30 years they've been trying to get that, right Especially for the farmers, because it's that kind of a business
trump, It's a great business, but it's day to day
trump, You have a bad crop, all of a sudden you can't pay interest on a loan to pay your state tax, right And they lose their farm
trump, So we're not going to have that anymore
trump, We achieved American energy independence for the first time
trump, Totally independent
trump, We don't have to be in those far away places unless we want to be
trump, Biden pledged to abolish American oil, American jail, clean coal, natural gas
trump, He said the fracking, I told you that, but we're not going to let him get away
trump, We'll be bringing that up on occasion
trump, For 47 years, Joe Biden crushed the dreams of Wisconsin workers and enriched foreign countries
trump, That's what happened
trump, Before I got here, what was happening with Japan And we pay our deep respects to Prime Minister Abe of Japan, a great friend of all of ours, a great friend of mine
trump, He's going to be leaving office very soon, like in a matter of a day
trump, And he was a great gentleman
trump, He's a tough negotiator, I'll tell you that
trump, He made very good deals against the United States, but he's somebody that's going to be missed
trump, He's a great gentleman
trump, He championed every special interest, Biden, every special interest
trump, And he sold out on trade
trump, He sold out like almost nobody ever before
trump, Earlier this year, I kept my promise to American workers when we ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law
trump, I saved the US auto industry by withdrawing from the last administration's job killing catastrophe, the Trans-Pacific Partnership
trump, You ever hear of that beauty That would have really hit you
trump, In 2017, I signed a historic executive order making government policy to buy American and hire American
trump, I'm watching this Biden and he's got his sign in front, Buy American
trump, Oh, by American
trump, I've been saying that for like 20 years, right Where the hell has this guy been They were actually accusing him of plagiarism
trump, I also took the toughest ever action to stand up to China's rampant theft of Wisconsin jobs
trump, And it's all jobs, but you got hit particularly hard
trump, Biden has vowed to remove those tariffs and allow China to resume its pillaging
trump, He wants to take the tariffs off that are paying us tens of billions of dollars a year
trump, I fought like hell to keep them into the China deal and he wants to remove them
trump, So tens of billions of dollars, billions and billions, I gave it to the farmers
trump, I gave it to a lot of people, but I gave most of it by far, to the US Treasury
trump, He wants to take them off
trump, So let me just ask you just a very innocent question
trump, There's a young man, about four years old up front, I think he could give the answer
trump, Who do you think would like to have China How do you think China would feel about this election In one case, they paid billions and billions of dollars a month to the US
trump, We never got ever, 25 cents from China
trump, In the other case, he said, We're going to take them off
trump, I think they might be inclined to go for Sleepy Joe
trump, This is like a dream for China
trump, Joe Biden's agenda is made in China
trump, My agenda is made in the USA
trump, It's very simple
trump, So we did many things
trump, Not only China, not only the 28 billion farmers
trump, We did so much and I'm proud to announce that I'm doing even more to support Wisconsin farmers
trump, Starting next week, my administration is committing an additional, you've been asking for this for a long time, 13 billion in relief to help farmers recover from the China virus, including Wisconsin's incredible dairy, cranberry and ginseng farmers who got hurt badly
trump, Been after that money for a long time
trump, When the Wisconsin timber industry was threatened, I imposed tariffs on dumped foreign timber and subsidized products, saving many, many timber jobs in your state
trump, If Joe Biden gets in, the radical left will shut down Wisconsin's timber production for environmental reasons
trump, Do you believe that Oh, boy
trump, It's so sad to see it, and that would happen
trump, But we can't let that happen
trump, We've come too far
trump, We're so good
trump, If that virus hadn't hit us, and it did, and it hit the whole world, but if it hadn't hit us, we would have numbers the likes of which nobody thought were even remotely possible
trump, But it did, and we saved a lot of lives
trump, They keep saying, Oh, they just … By the way, if we had two people die, they would have said he did a terrible job
trump, If we had 100 people die, if we had 1000, no matter what we do
trump, We have trade deals
trump, We announced a trade deal, everybody is saying how great it is
trump, Schumer and Pelosi see it, they have no idea what the deal is, We don't like the deal
trump, Did you look at it Oh, of course, we looked at it
trump, It doesn't have tariffs
trump, Oh no, it does have tariffs
trump, They know nothing about the deal
trump, Automatically, anything we do, they just take the reverse
trump, But you know what I'd probably do it to them too, so I can't complain
trump, And perhaps no issue have our opponents more thoroughly betrayed working families of all backgrounds than on the subject of immigration
trump, Under my administration, we've achieved the most secure border in American history
trump, We ended the catch and release
trump, You know what catch and release is You catch up them, they may be a killer, they may be a criminal at the highest order, you take their name
trump, Then you're supposed to bring them to a court, like Perry Mason, right But we actually catch them, take their name, release them, say, Come back in about four years for your court case
trump, We ended all this stuff
trump, And you think that was easy It wasn't easy, let me tell you
trump, It was tough, but we have a really good, secure border
trump, And the president of Mexico has been terrific
trump, We right now have 27,000 soldiers from Mexico guarding our border, free of charge
trump, We stopped asylum fraud, and we've deported 20,000 gang members and over a half a million criminal illegal aliens of the worst kind
trump, We're enforcing the clear requirement that newcomers to our country must be financially self-sufficient and not reliant on welfare
trump, They have to sign a document
trump, We invested 2
trump, 5 trillion in the US military, including major contracts to build new warships that helped save the historic shipyard in Marinette
trump, How about that I was there two months ago
trump, Marinette
trump, That's a great company, but it was having a hard time
trump, And now, they're building, what was that, like 6 billion worth of ships And their beauties
trump, They've started already, and we worked very hard on that
trump, And we had a lot of help from your congressman on that one, because a lot of people wanted that contract
trump, But we got it for Wisconsin, remember that
trump, We launched the first new branch of the United States Armed Forces in nearly 75 years
trump, That's right, the Space Force
trump, The fact is, and somebody said it on the other side, an opponent said whether you like it or not, Trump actually did more as president than he promised during the campaign
trump, Like Space Force, that's a big deal
trump, Think of it army, navy, air force, marine
trump, … Think of it, Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, right
trump, Think of it
trump, I mean, that's all you heard your whole life, right
trump, The Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marines, Coast Guard and now, we have the Space Force
trump, You know what a big deal, first time in 75 years, it's a new one
trump, Last one was 75 years ago
trump, The Air Force, right
trump, That's a big thing
trump, I never talked about that on the campaign, I never even thought about it
trump, When I became president, I said, We have to do this
trump, Because I saw what Russia was doing, and I saw what China was doing
trump, And, they've created their Space Forces, I said, What are we going to do, not have it
trump, It's going to end up being maybe your most important or certainly one of your most important because that's where it's at, in terms of defense, in terms of offense
trump, We passed VA choice and VA accountability for our great veterans that we had the other day
trump, Veterans satisfaction, 91 percent, the highest score we've ever received
trump, You haven't noticed, remember years ago, every story, every night, the Nightly News, you'd always have horrible stories about the VA, you don't see it anymore
trump, Now, I don't want to give them any ideas, because they'll search all over the country for a vet who's unhappy
trump, I'm hurting myself by telling this story
trump, This is not a good story
trump, But remember that, every night you'd have these horror stories about the VA
trump, You don't see that anymore
trump, 91 percent approval rating
trump, I kept my promise recognized the Capital of Israel and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem
trump, I recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights and we achieve the first breakthrough in the Middle East peace and, you saw that two days ago, UAE, Bahrain, Israel, nobody thought it was even possible
trump, I saw John Kerry on television the other day
trump, It is not possible
trump, Then we waited a little while
trump, He went very, very strong, It is not possible
trump, And, it was not only possible, we have many countries that are joining us very soon
trump, We killed the founder and the leader, the vicious leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi, we killed him
trump, And, we also took out the world's number one terrorist and the mass murder of American troops and many, many troops and many people, all over the world
trump, Qasem Soleimani is dead, he's dead, bad guy, bad guy, very bad guy
trump, We kept America out of new wars and we're bringing our troops back home
trump, No one has been more wrong, more often than sleepy Joe Biden
trump, He voted for the Iraq War, he supported the defense sequester that gutted our military
trump, I took over a military that was totally depleted, like
trump, Hillary Clinton deleted, as opposed to depleted, she depleted them too but, she deleted 33,000 emails
trump, When is somebody going to pull the spring Ah, come on fellows
trump, No, that's terrible
trump, 33,000 emails
trump, Try going to court sometime on a civil case, and when you go before the judge, he'll say, Did you delete those emails Did you get rid of those texts Did you this…, Right
trump, And, now they caught Weissmann and all these guys cleaning their phones because they were under investigation, and they cleaned their phones
trump, How many were there 21, but they were like 33 phones
trump, And yet, look what they do to General Flynn, and some of these people that did nothing
trump, They cleaned their criminals, yeah, that's criminal, it's criminal, they're criminals
trump, They talk and talk and talk, they're criminals
trump, They clean their phone, so you don't have any of the information, but that's a big problem for them, I would imagine
trump, It's a disgrace that they can do it
trump, But, Hillary got rid of… She deleted and acid-wash, right
trump, Who acid-washed Did you ever… And, she also used to bang them with a hammer, remember that, we forgot that, right
trump, So, let's see what happens with all of that stuff
trump, I think Bill Barr's doing an excellent job, I have to tell you
trump, And, he's fighting a very bad establishment in Washington
trump, There's some bad apples in that whole deal
trump, But, if you think that Biden opposed the mission to take out of Osama bin Laden, he was against it
trump, He opposed the killing of Soleimani
trump, He oversaw the rise of ISIS, what a mistake
trump, And, he cheered the rise of China as a very positive development for America and the world, I don't think so
trump, I don't think so
trump, It's not been too positive
trump, If it were up to sleepy, Joe Biden, bin Ladin and Soleimani, would be alive
trump, ISIS would still be on the rampage and China would now be the dominant power in the world and there not even close, I will tell you
trump, We have weaponry, the likes of which nobody's seen
trump, 2
trump,5 trillion buys you some good stuff, especially when we have the finest scientific minds and military minds in the world
trump, We have weapons, the likes of which nobody's seen, and just hope to God, we never have to use them
trump, I say that, and I say, it's strongly
trump, Hope that we never have to use them
trump, My attitude was that, and I've learned this a long time ago, by having them, we keep ourselves out of war, as opposed to bringing ourselves in war
trump, But, we have built and created weapons, the likes of which this world has never seen before
trump, And, we don't have to talk about it too much, nor do I really want to talk about it
trump, When I ban travel from China, Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic, he said, He's xenophobic
trump, What does that mean Joe, tell me
trump, Biden also opposed my plan to ban Europe, I saw what was happening in France and Spain and Italy, and highly infected, we banned Europe
trump, If we had insisted and listened to Joe and insisted on doing what so many other people said doing, which is, You don't have to do the ban
trump, Hundreds of thousands of more Americans would have died from the plague
trump, Biden was willing to sacrifice American lives, on the altar of open borders
trump, And now, I hear him talking, he should have followed me
trump, This guy did the swine flu, right, it was a catastrophe
trump, And, the man that headed up the swine flu, I won't use his name because I'd like to have him have a nice evening, because I can't imagine the democrats are thrilled
trump, He said, It was a horrible job, we had no idea what we were doing, it was a disaster
trump, He said, It was a disaster
trump, And now, Biden's telling us how to do what we're doing so well on, what other countries are calling me and congratulating me on the incredible job
trump, And I got sleepy, Joe Biden, trying to tell me how to do it
trump, And, his own man who headed it up, swine flu, it's H1N1 swine flu
trump, Joe called it, N1H1
trump, I keep saying Joe, Joe, it's H1N1, right
trump, I said, It's easier to remember because H comes before N, but he can't do it
trump, And then, you saw what he said the other day under a Harris-Biden administration
trump, That was a disaster
trump, I never said under a Pence Trump administration, he said, Under a Harris-Biden administration
trump, And, what made it worse, is she said the same thing
trump, That was terrible, right
trump, Sean, right
trump, Did you hear that They are a disaster together
trump, Through our historic relief programs, we saved more than 1 million Wisconsin jobs and 87,000 Wisconsin businesses, that's not too bad
trump, And, Biden would demolish all of those games, and we've done similar things in other states
trump, He would destroy your social security, totally destroy it, and destroy protections for preexisting conditions
trump, They want to go to social medicine, they want to go to social… You know that, right
trump, You do know that
trump, They want social healthcare where you don't… Remember Obama 28 times, you can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan, that didn't work out too well, right
trump, Why haven't they looked into that one, 28 times
trump, Well, under Medicare for All, but it's basically socialized healthcare, you will never have your doctor, you will never have your plan
trump, You'll have horrible healthcare
trump, You're going to wait long times, long times
trump, And, he wants to wipe out 180 million private healthcare plans that people love, 180 million plans
trump, I don't think so
trump, I don't think he's going to make it
trump, How do you get elected Let's say you're doing, not only here, let's say Texas, right, he's against oil, he's against God and he's against guns
trump, That's a tough combination in Texas
trump, How does that apply Now, he's against religion
trump, They won't open these blue states, they will not open your churches
trump, They won't open them
trump, And, I think they have an ulterior motive
trump, One thing they have is, probably everything opens on November 4th, you understand that
trump, And, they better be careful, those paper ballots you talk about, a bad thing, just get out and vote, get out and vote
trump, And, if you have to go that route, make sure they have it counted
trump, And, they know it's trouble
trump, They just had another election today, fellows, where it's a disaster
trump, The votes come in, they have no idea, they can't count them
trump, And, I don't mean they're off by a little bit, they're off by 20 percent, 25 percent
trump, There's fraud
trump, There's missing ballots
trump, They have a woman in New York who is a terrible congresswoman, you know that
trump, Carolyn Maloney
trump, They gave her an election, they can't even find the ballots
trump, And, they gave her a victory, and they cant find that the guy that is against her, who did very well, even though he's even more progressive, I don't even know what she is
trump, I've known her for 25 years
trump, I don't think she's progressive
trump, I think she's whatever she has to be
trump, But this guy, probably or possibly beat her
trump, So, rightfully he's not too happy
trump, And, they called the election for her and they can't find the ballots
trump, Wants to force you to provide free healthcare to illegal aliens, you remember he raised his hand, that will totally drain your wonderful Medicare
trump, Remember the question up there, he's standing up,  Who is willing to give free healthcare to illegal aliens
trump, And, everybody raises their hands like fast
trump, Kamala was right up there
trump, By the way, that will destroy your country, you do know that
trump, Because you can't afford it, and Biden's looking around, Oh, they all raise their hand
trump, He goes, remember
trump, I remember
trump, I said, Well, there it goes, the election for him
trump, He's end our travel bans on jihadist regions and increase refugee admissions by over 700 percent
trump, And, that's the deal he made with Bernie Sanders, opening the flood gates to terror, afflicted nations
trump, But I predict the Sanders people are going to vote for us, like they did the last time
trump, We had a tremendous…
trump, Because they love my stance on trade, because I know trade, and I was telling him much more so, than even Bernie
trump, But Bernie, is right on that subject, that other countries, including our so-called allies are ripping us off on trade
trump, Biden opposes, school choice and vowed to ban charter schools
trump, Did you know that Does everybody like charter schools Everybody likes choice
trump, In the second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America
trump, We're all set up to get it done
trump, A vote for republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans
trump, It's really a vote for the American dream, instead of letting Washington change us
trump, And, despite all that we've all gone through
trump, We are changing Washington, that's what's been happening
trump, And, just in conclusion, and I hate concluding with you because I like you
trump, I like you
trump, I don't know why the hell I like Wisconsin, but for some reason
trump, You know what helps so, as you know for weeks before the election, she was four up, crooked Hillary, four up, four up, four up, I kept saying, Do you think we're going to win And I will say, Sean Duffy said, You're going to win
trump, He actually said, Don't worry about it
trump, Right, Sean
trump, I said, Sean do you think we're going to win here I don't like these polls, but four down
trump, He said, Sir, you're going to win so easy
trump, And, early in the night, they said, Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin
trump, And, so when I'm here, speaking in the freezing cold, I'm lucky they had… I said, Do you think we have… It's very warm in New York and very warm in Washington, it was hot actually
trump, And I said, Do you think we have a coat on the plane They said, Yes
trump, I said, What's the temperature Sir, it's 49 degrees
trump, I said, How about giving me a coat They have everything on Air Force One, that's the great thing
trump, Got more televisions in any plane in history
trump, They've got televisions in closets, on floors, on ceiling
trump, But, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world
trump, And, we will end our reliance on China once and for all
trump, We'll make our medical supplies right here in the United States, and right here in the great state of Wisconsin
trump, We will rapidly return to full employment, that's happening very fast, soaring economies and the record prosperity will be even greater than it was, last year
trump, We will hire more police, increase penalties on assaults of law enforcement, surge federal prosecutors into high crime communities
trump, And, we will ban sanctuary cities, which are deadly
trump, We will appoint prosecutors, judges, and justices who believe in enforcing the law, not their own political agenda
trump, We will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed
trump, We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life
trump, We will uphold religious Liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear Arms
trump, We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens, and we will keep America out of endless Foreign Wars
trump, And, you remember with me, they thought because of my personality, they said, He'll be in war the first week
trump, What happened to the war Remember, we were going to be in war with North Korea
trump, Hillary would have been in war with North Korea
trump, It would have been a nasty one too
trump, But remember, everybody said, I was going to be in war
trump, Everybody said, Oh, maybe I'll do something with social security
trump, And, I did
trump, I saved it and made it stronger
trump, And now, I'm going to make it even stronger
trump, And, they're going to get rid of your social security because everything's going to come collapsing down
trump, You will have a depression
trump, If he gets in, they're going to raise interest rates
trump, They're going to raise your taxes, you will have a depression
trump, The likes of which this country has never seen before
trump, And, your 401k's and your stocks and jobs will go down in flames
trump, I just say it here, hopefully we're never going to experience it, but that's what's going to happen
trump, We will maintain America's unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength
trump, We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, which I've already signed
trump, Further reduced health insurance premiums, or the costs of prescription drugs, which are coming down now
trump, You know, I signed favored nations clauses, their drug companies are not happy with me, I will tell you
trump, They never thought it was possible and rebate clauses
trump, They never thought anybody would do that to them
trump, They made enough money for a long time
trump, It's time, you got a big break
trump, We will strongly protect Medicare and social security
trump, And, we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions, always, you have a pledge
trump, We will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars
trump, And, NASA is now the hottest space center anywhere in the world
trump, And, when I took over three and a half years ago, there was grass growing in the runways, you know that it was closed down, it was a mess
trump, We are now the hottest in the world
trump, You see what's going up
trump, And, we've got a lot of rich guys sending them up too
trump, I liked that better
trump, I said, Let them do it
trump, Rich guys like rockets, I don't know, they like rocket, boom
trump, I see dollars going right up, but they need a good place to launch
trump, We have the best places
trump, We have the best places, so it's been incredible what we've done with NASA
trump, We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools
trump, We're already there again
trump, We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag
trump, And, we will live by the timeless works of our national motto, In God We Trust
trump, For years, you had a president who apologized for America
trump, Now, you have a president who is standing up for America, and standing up for the State of Wisconsin
trump, So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, get everybody and get out and vote, November 3rd
trump, From Milwaukee to Madison, from Oshkosh to La Crosse
trump, From Green Bay, how the Packers doing so far Good team, good people, to right here in… Give me the proper pronunciation
trump, That's right, thank you, that's what I said
trump, We inherit the legacy of generations of Wisconsin Patriots, who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation
trump, We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed a wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industry, won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world
trump, And, you haven't seen anything yet
trump, Proud citizens like you, helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country
trump, We are returning power to you, the American people
trump, With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning
trump, We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God
trump, And together, with the incredible people of Wisconsin, we will make America wealthy again
trump, We will make America strong again
trump, We will make America proud again
trump, We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again
trump, Thank you, Wisconsin
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you
trump,
trump, Thank you very much everybody
trump, Thank you
trump, Wow
trump, I will never, ever let you down, that I can tell you
trump, Amazing
trump, And I want to thank Manchester and New Hampshire, they're very special
trump, You remember those primaries That primary came around and remember what happened during the primary Trump should come in third or fourth, and we came in easily number one, and that was the beginning
trump, That was an easy one
trump, I want to thank you all
trump, This is incredible and it's great to be back in a state that I love with thousands of hardworking Patriots, who are the heart and soul of America
trump, And that's what you are
trump, We're actually here today to officially launch our campaign to win the great state of New Hampshire in 2020
trump, And I saw some fake polls put out by the fake news media, and it said that I'm tied with three of the other candidates, the Democrats, I'm tied in New Hampshire
trump, I don't think so
trump, One of them has a rally, he's got 100 people
trump, So this holds 12,000 we're full
trump, And we could fill it up four times at least
trump, We could fill it up four times
trump, But I just want to thank you all
trump, I just think it's going to be a tremendous four years
trump, We're going to have a tremendous four years
trump, Can you believe it We only have a little more than a year to go, where it all started, right The greatest political movement in the history of our country
trump, And even though we had fake witch hunts on our back and all the other things that we had to go through, we have taken this big beautiful ship, and it's being turned around very quickly
trump, Three years ago, we campaigned across the country on a pledge to make America great again
trump, And that's exactly what we've done
trump, I think we can honestly say it's the greatest slogan in the history of politics in America
trump, Make America great again
trump, So if you don't mind, the other candidates go, they spend millions and millions of dollars on this question that I'm going to ask you
trump, They spend millions
trump, You remember the first slogan from our opponent That's right, neither do I
trump, Neither does anybody
trump, Nobody remembers
trump, The only thing I remember is the first night I went out after I heard it and I said, see, it's all about her
trump, And they immediately changed it after spending like a million dollars
trump, It's all about her
trump, That didn't work out too well
trump, That slogan wasn't too good
trump, So we have to do this
trump, We have to make a decision
trump, Do you give up the greatest slogan in the history of politics in our country Make America great again, right Do we give up make America great again for a new slogan, because look, our country is doing great
trump, We are doing very well with China despite the fact that they want to have you believe in the contrary
trump, All you have to do is say China, how you doing They're not too happy, they're not too happy
trump, They're losing millions of jobs
trump, The tariffs are working, and they're eating the tariffs by the way
trump, There's no price increase
trump, You know, you gotta talk to these people
trump, The fake news
trump, But do we give up And by the way, the biggest beneficiary, you know who have been great Our great farmers have been so incredible because they've been targeted by China, and frankly they've been targeted for a long time, including by incompetent politicians that have run this country for a long time
trump, So we're making up for a lot of lost ground
trump, But do we give up make America great for keep America great Keep America great
trump, Okay, you ready Ready I love this because it's free
trump, And we have all the time in the world, right Is there anything better than a Trump rally What about a sleepy Joe Biden rally Well, he's made some beauties
trump, I sort of hope it's him
trump, I don't mind any of them
trump, You got Pocahontas is rising
trump, We got Kamala
trump, Kamala is falling
trump, You got Beto
trump, Beto is like gone
trump, All right, we'll see what happens
trump, Whoever it is, I don't know that it matters, but whoever it is different, different people
trump, But I don't know, I think sleepy Joe may be able to limp across the finish line
trump, But today they announced that they're going to cut way back on his appearances because he is such a disaster, they're going to have fewer appearances
trump, You've heard that, right They're going to cut way back on his appearances
trump, Can you believe it If I ever did that, it would be over
trump, The fake news would get us, but we don't let them get us and it is fake
trump, And today the deputy editor of the New York times was demoted
trump, Isn't that beautiful All the news that is not fit to print
trump, All the news, the fake failing New York Times
trump, It's really we, it's not me
trump, We're doing it together
trump, They came from the Hills, they came from the mountains, from the rivers, they came from all over the place
trump, And they showed up and they voted like nobody's seen before
trump, And it was 306 to 223, remember 306
trump, And we won Wisconsin and they said, Oh, we never thought of that
trump, Got to think about those things
trump, And we won Michigan
trump, And now we have a lot of car companies coming into Michigan, and we have a lot of great farming events happening, really big in Wisconsin
trump, And we have incredible things going on in Pennsylvania
trump, We just opened up a 10 billion plant
trump, We have many of them going up
trump, Many of them, a lot of jobs
trump, In Louisiana, an LNG plant 10 billion
trump, Could never have happened, could never have happened
trump, Pennsylvania would have never happened
trump, They wouldn't have allowed him to frack
trump, So they would've never been able to build it
trump, But what a place that is, it will be open in a little more than a year, but I have to make a decision
trump, It's a big decision
trump, Do we give up the greatest theme, phrase, logo, whatever you want to call it, in the history of politics, risky, for a brand new one because make America great again
trump, We're really sort of there, and we have a little time left
trump, And now we have a group of socialists or communists, could be
trump, They're not far away
trump, The fake news will hit me on that
trump, How dare he say that But they're not far away, right They're not far away
trump, 95
trump, Does anybody want to pay 95 taxes I don't think so
trump, But I'm not going to go into their plan because as far as I'm concerned, the green new deal is a beautiful thing
trump, No, it's a beautiful thing
trump, We want it to continue onward until about a month before the election
trump, I will let them have it like you've never heard before
trump, I don't want it to change
trump, Too early
trump, It's like Elizabeth Warren
trump, I did the Pocahontas thing
trump, I hit her really hard, and it looked like she was down and out, but that was too long ago
trump, I should've waited
trump, But don't worry
trump, We will revive it
trump, It can be revived
trump, It can be rewritten, right It will be revived and it can be revived very easily and very quickly
trump, And we're going to have some fun in the state of New Hampshire
trump, Now what do we do, ready Let me have first make America great again, then keep America great, right Just applaud like crazy for the one you want to use for this campaign
trump, And there's a possibility we'll use both
trump, There's a possibility we'll use both 'cause I hate like hell to give up the one
trump, Is it a possibility we'll use both Maybe one a little bit less
trump, Are you ready So we'll start make America great again, and then keep America
trump, Are you ready Who's in favor of the campaign theme being make America great again Who's in favor of our theme being keep America great Oh, wait a minute
trump, This is your hat
trump, I was going to keep it actually
trump, Thank you
trump, So that's really been the reaction
trump, I've done this before
trump, Big crowds, and it really is keep America great because we have these socialists want to take it away from us
trump, They want to take it away
trump, Because until a couple of days ago, and that'll catch up very quickly, we have no choice
trump, By the way, I never said China was going to be easy, but it's not tough and they want to make a deal
trump, We just spoke to them yesterday
trump, They want to make a deal
trump, They want to make a deal
trump, They have to make a deal
trump, And you know what It'd be wonderful to make a deal
trump, I don't think we're ready to make a deal
trump, We're taking in billions of dollars in tariffs
trump, And again, China's devaluing their currency
trump, They're pouring out money, the prices haven't gone up
trump, So that means we're taking in billions of dollars
trump, We're not paying for it
trump, And ultimately their devaluations are going to hurt them very badly
trump, They want to make a deal, and they should want to make a deal
trump, But when you listen to the fake news, look at how many there are
trump, I mean, I actually had something today
trump, I had something today
trump, Are we sure that we're in New Hampshire You know, you have a reputation
trump, I mean, I know it's not true 'cause I know you too well
trump, You have a reputation of being very stayed, very, very elegant, stayed, incredible people
trump, You're not acting it tonight, and that's good
trump, That's a good thing
trump, Wow
trump, We love our country
trump, We have enthusiasm for our country
trump, That's what it is
trump, Before the election, our factories were closing
trump, Hey, who knows it better than you You're like central casting for the closing of factories
trump, Our jobs were vanishing
trump, Our military was totally depleted
trump, When I took over, our military was sad
trump, We weren't flying half of our planes, they were old
trump, They were tired
trump, Our equipment was tired
trump, Our people weren't tired, though
trump, Our people weren't tired
trump, But everything we had, it was depleted
trump, Now we've rebuilt our military like never before
trump, And all made in the USA, just so you know
trump, And our nation was weakened at home and disrespected abroad
trump, They don't disrespect us anymore, folks
trump, I got NATO to pay an extra hundred billion dollars
trump, They weren't paying
trump, They were delinquent
trump, Many nations were, except for seven
trump, Many nations weren't paying what they were supposed to be paying, so we're supposed to protect them
trump, They kill us on trade
trump, They have all sorts of barriers and everything else
trump, The taxes are really unfair
trump, The tariffs were ridiculous, what they do to us in Europe
trump, And then we protect them
trump, Then they don't pay, and I say, I'm sorry folks, you have to pay
trump, You have to pay
trump, They were delinquent, they were delinquent
trump, And my biggest fan is secretary General Stoltenberg from NATO
trump, He said until president Trump came along, we were going, boom
trump, They would've been finished very quickly, but I'm tired of paying for other nations anyway, I have to be honest with you
trump, Today, our nation is stronger than ever before
trump, We're now stronger than ever before
trump, You saw we ended the Iran disaster
trump, How about that We paid them a 150 billion
trump, 1
trump,8 billion in cash
trump, Cash, cash, cash
trump, We got nothing
trump, And they also want to make a deal
trump, China wants to make a deal, and I will tell you Iran wants to make a deal because the sanctions are not good for them
trump, They are not happy
trump, So we'll see how it all turns out
trump, But it's in good hands
trump, It's in good hands
trump, The United States right now has the hottest economy anywhere in the world
trump, We're rebuilding that awesome might that we were just talking about
trump, Our United States armed forces
trump, America is working again
trump, America is winning again, and America is respected again, respected like never before
trump, They respect us again, and you see it
trump, You know, a recent poll came out where it showed that president Obama was more popular in Germany and other places than I am
trump, And I said, of course he's more popular
trump, He's not demanding that they pay for their protection that we provide
trump, He's not doing that
trump, I'm doing that
trump, And in fact, if I was the most popular, I'm not doing my job right
trump, So true
trump, We've created over six million new jobs since the election
trump, If I would have said that during the campaign, those people back there would have been headlines, headlines
trump, More than seven million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps
trump, Since my election, the number of new businesses starting in the great state of New Hampshire has skyrocketed by almost 25
trump, And you can't really go by my election
trump, You gotta go by November 9th because the markets have gone through the roof since November 9th
trump, That's the day after I won the election
trump, So I won the election
trump, The markets went up thousands of points
trump, Things started happening
trump, You started doing things that you would've never
trump, Even though I didn't get sworn in until January 20th, but they refused to do that
trump, And let me tell you, if for some reason I wouldn't have won the election, these markets would have crashed
trump, That'll happen even more so in 2020
trump, See the bottom line is I know you like me and this room is a love fest, I know that
trump, But you have no choice but to vote for me because your 401ks down the tubes
trump, Everything's going to be down the tubes, so whether you love me or hate me, you got to vote for me
trump, I had a businessman the other day, one of the most successful guys in the country
trump, I've never liked him, never liked him
trump, He never liked me, I never liked him
trump, I see him in the white house
trump, I said, What are you doing here He said, I'm working to make sure you get elected
trump, I said, You've got to be kidding
trump, You don't like me
trump, I don't like you
trump, What the hell is this all about He said, That's right
trump, We've had our differences
trump, I haven't liked you, but to be honest with you, Mr
trump, President, I have no choice
trump, I said, You're right
trump, You're right
trump, First thing I've ever heard him say that I agreed with, he's got no choice
trump, He got no choice
trump, Unemployment in New Hampshire has reached the lowest rate in actually 31 years
trump, But within a very short period of time, it will be the lowest rate in the history of our country
trump, Think of that
trump, You have the best unemployment, you have the most successful state in the history of your state, and in the history of our country
trump, And then you're going to vote for somebody else Oh, great
trump, Let's vote for Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren
trump, We have the best numbers we've ever had
trump, Let's vote for somebody else
trump, I don't think that's going to happen, folks
trump, I don't think that's going to happen
trump, Only with fixed poles does that happen Unemployment for African Americans
trump, You've heard me say this many times, and I'm very proud of it
trump, Hispanic Americans and Asian Americans have all reached their lowest rates ever recorded in the history of our county
trump, Wages are rising quickly
trump, Remember when I used to say people have been working two and three jobs making less money than they made 21 years ago I used to say it all the time
trump, Now I can say for the first time in 20 years, wages are rising, and you know who's the biggest beneficiary Blue collar workers
trump, My administration is fighting to expand opportunity for citizens of every background and every race, religion, color, and creed
trump, Very important
trump, Because we are all Americans
trump, We all share the same home
trump, We all share the same heart
trump, We all share the same dreams
trump, We are all children of the same Almighty God
trump, But at the very moment when our country should be coming together to enjoy these wonderful blessings, the radical Democrats are trying to tear America apart
trump, They vilify anyone who doesn't share their extreme views
trump, They slander our law enforcement heroes
trump, You see what they're doing with our police that we love
trump, You see what they're doing
trump, Has anyone ever seen anything like the water being thrown on New York's finest Have you ever seen And I know a lot of New York's finest
trump, They're not happy, they're not happy
trump, And they are great people
trump, These are great, great, proud people
trump, For that to be allowed to happen is a disgrace
trump, They view everybody as fascist and Nazis
trump, They used the term Nazi
trump, This was a term, you couldn't even use it
trump, Now they use it like on a regular basis
trump, Nazi
trump, He's a Nazi
trump, Think of that
trump, He's a Nazi
trump, You couldn't use it
trump, Now they use it
trump, They accuse our heroic border agents of running concentration camps, and they do an incredible job
trump, And the Democrats don't want to fix the loopholes or asylum
trump, They do an incredible job, our border agents
trump, And they looked down upon the hardworking citizens who truly make our country run
trump, But while the Democrats rage and resist … That guy's got a serious weight problem
trump, Go home, start exercising
trump, Get him out of here please
trump, You got a bigger problem than I do
trump, Got a bigger problem than all of us
trump, Now he goes home and his mom says, What the hell have you just done We are continuing our incredible movement, the greatest political movement in the history of our country
trump, There's never been a movement like this
trump, Never
trump, Our movement is built on love, and it is, and we love our family
trump, We love our faith
trump, We love our flag, and we love our freedom, and that's what it's about
trump, And add to that the fact that we love our neighbors and we love our- … the fact that we love our neighbors and we love our country
trump, Together we are all united by one fundamental principal
trump, A nation's first duty must always be to its own citizens, it's own
trump, We've got to take care of our own
trump, You haven't heard that from a politician or a political leader in a long time
trump, It's called America First
trump, It's America First
trump, We're thrilled to be joined tonight by many tremendous Republican leaders and great friends of mine, a man who's doing an incredible job as your governor, because I want to take 100 of the credit for the incredible turnaround of New Hampshire, and I remember it not so long ago, things were not looking good
trump, People were leaving, a lot of bad things were happening, but we have to give him a lot of credit
trump, He's been a great governor, Chris Sununu, with a great father too, great father
trump, With a great father… His father was tough
trump, Chris, your father was so tough
trump, He was for somebody else in the primaries, and then one by one… I won here, I won there, I won there
trump, And then when I won his father got on and I said, Oh, this guy kills me
trump, He's so tough, and he said, President Trump will be the greatest of all time
trump, I said, What happened What happened He went from being the toughest critic to the best there is
trump, So I want to say hello to your father, okay Chris You'll tell him
trump, Great guy
trump, What a family
trump, What a family
trump, Thank you for Chris
trump, New Hampshire Senate Republican leader, Chuck Morse
trump, Chuck
trump, Thanks, Chuck
trump, New Hampshire House Republican leader, Dick Hinch
trump, Thank you, Dick
trump, Thank you, Dick
trump, Great job
trump, A man who was with me right from the beginning
trump, In fact, he had a meeting at his house
trump, His house has never been the same
trump, His house is a disaster now
trump, Like somebody said he just sold it
trump, But you know what Because of the Trump economy, I'll bet he sold it for a big, big, fat, beautiful profit
trump, Where is Steve Steve Stepanek and his wife, who's incredible
trump, Did you make a lot of money on the house We destroyed the house
trump, This was the beginning
trump, He held some kind of a meeting for me, and he has a nice house, but literally hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people showed up and they destroyed his house
trump, It's never been the same
trump, No wonder you sold it
trump, They finally gave up, and that was four years ago
trump, Anyway, thank you very much both for being here
trump, I appreciate it
trump, What great people
trump, Thank you, Steve
trump, Great job
trump, And I hope the buyer of his house didn't hear that little… Steve
trump, I hope the buyer didn't hear what I just said about your house
trump, He'll cancel… That's all right
trump, You'll sell it for more to somebody else, don't worry
trump, Republican party chair, Ronna McDaniel
trump, You know, Ronna headed up Michigan, and for many, many years nobody won Michigan as a Republican
trump, But I used to complain, I'd go there and I'd say They're stealing your car business
trump, I'd go for years
trump, In fact, five or six years before I even thought about running, for whatever reason, they named me Man of the Year in Michigan
trump, I said, How come I didn't even understand it myself, but I was named Man of the Year
trump, I wasn't even political
trump, That was years before I did this
trump, But I was always complaining that our car business is being stolen
trump, I mean, it's sort of obvious, right Mexico now has 32 of our car business
trump, It all left the state of Michigan
trump, We are bringing it back at a level that nobody's ever seen before, our car business
trump, But I went to Michigan and my opponent was told that the Republicans, no way you can win Michigan, or Wisconsin, that you just can't
trump, And we had a campaign manager named Ronna McDaniel, and Ronna wouldn't stop
trump, Sir, can you be here next week I say, I don't know
trump, Then I leave and she said, Sir, can you come back in three days I said, I don't know
trump, Then I do it and she said, How about another time And then on election night she said, Sir, it was six o'clock the day before the election
trump, In other words, just a short while before the election
trump, She calls me, Sir, can you be here tonight I said Tonight And by the way, you know where I was I was in New Hampshire
trump, That's right
trump, She said, Sir, can you be here tonight I said, Are you sure I started speaking at one o'clock in the morning
trump, Now it's election day
trump, We had 32,000 people show up
trump, It was like this
trump, The crowd was just, they want to see things happen in our country
trump, They love our country
trump, It went crazy
trump, I left and I said, I don't know why going to lose Michigan
trump, Why would we lose Michigan Look at this
trump, The opponent went there with Barack Obama and Michelle Obama and she went there much earlier
trump, Prime time, one o'clock, two o'clock in the morning is not exactly prime time
trump, We had 32,000 and they had a tiny little crowd, and I looked at my people and I said, I know we're not supposed to win the great state of Michigan, but I think we're going to win Michigan and we won Michigan and we won Wisconsin
trump, We won Wisconsin
trump, Wisconsin was a great victory, and we won Pennsylvania, and we won North Carolina and South Carolina, and we won Florida, and I hate to tell you we should've won New Hampshire
trump, That was taken away
trump, New Hampshire was taken away
trump, It was taken away from us, but we should've
trump, We did great in New Hampshire
trump, We should've won New Hampshire, but that's okay
trump, I'm not holding it against you because it was not your fault
trump, But we had a woman in Michigan and I said, When it came time to choosing the head of the Republican National Committee, I said, Who the hell is that woman up in Michigan that got me to keep coming there and explaining that we can't continue to lose our car business We have 17 companies now coming back in
trump, Who is that woman And it was Ronna
trump, We put her in charge of the Republican National Committee
trump, The job that she has done is incredible
trump, Thank you
trump, The same with another man, our campaign manager
trump, He started off as a computer genius, and remember when they used to say that the Hillary Clinton campaign is highly sophisticated, highly… She did a lot of bad things folks
trump, 33,000 emails deleted after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress, 33,000
trump, Remember she said it was about her daughter's wedding and yoga classes, 33,000, yes
trump, it was disgraceful
trump, I will tell you this, we now have a great attorney general
trump, A fair guy, a great gentleman
trump, Another man who's here tonight is the world's tallest campaign manager
trump, He is an unbelievable talent
trump, But they were saying about our opponents… I'm not going to mention the name again because we'll never get it finished here, so I'll just say my opponent
trump, Is that better They were saying how sophisticated her campaign was
trump, Except ours was far more sophisticated, and we had a man that did an incredible job
trump, He's now our campaign manager and he's one of the tallest human beings I've ever seen
trump, His name is Brad Parscale and he is fantastic
trump, It's nice when you don't have to look for anybody
trump, You just look over and you see a guy who's twice as tall as everyone
trump, Great job, Brad
trump, Thank you
trump, How we doing, Brad Good
trump, Doing good
trump, Got great poll numbers
trump, We've got great poll numbers in a lot of states, Ohio, Iowa
trump, You know Iowa, every week that they campaign our numbers go up
trump, They're winning Iowa
trump, We gave them ethanol, which is very important
trump, A lot of things for Iowa, but every week we seem to be going up in Iowa because they're campaigning in Iowa
trump, Wherever they go, our numbers go up
trump, Somebody's going to have to explain that one to me someday, but we like it
trump, A man who's a friend of mine who was the greatest mayor in the history of New York City
trump, Stand up, Rudy
trump, Stand up, Rudy
trump, Rudy Giuliani
trump, Man, he did a job in the first year
trump, I've never seen anything like it
trump, New York was crime infested
trump, We had problems
trump, We had problems like nobody would believe
trump, Rudy went in there and he did the job and people loved him for it
trump, It wasn't like, Oh gee, he's a horrible person
trump, People loved Rudy Giuliani
trump, He was a great, great mayor
trump, So thank you, Rudy, for being here
trump, The first person that I put on on the campaign, he was driving me wild
trump, He said, I'm saying you can win, sir
trump, You can win
trump, I'm telling you, you can win
trump, He loves this state
trump, He's from this state
trump, He said, You can win, sir
trump, I'm just telling you
trump, I had him on for month after month
trump, He'd come drive me crazy
trump, He'd say, You can win, you can win, you can win
trump, And finally we said, Let's give it a shot
trump, And I had Corey, I had Hope, I had just a couple of people
trump, We had a rather lean and mean staff
trump, But Corey Lewandowski loves your state, loves New Hampshire
trump, He was the first one that talked about us possibly winning the whole big ballgame
trump, He's tough and he's smart and I'm hearing he's thinking about running for the Senate from New Hampshire
trump, There we go
trump, I think he'd be tough to beat
trump, I'll tell you one thing, he'll go into Washington and he's going to have you in mind
trump, He's going to do a job if he does do it, so we'll see what happens
trump, He hasn't made up his mind yet, but he would be fantastic
trump, I guess it's something you go back and you talk to your family, you talk to your wife and you make a decision
trump, They're all saying, Are you going to support him I said, I don't know if he's running
trump, So Corey, let us know please, if you don't mind
trump, Let us know
trump, Our shared Republican agenda is pro worker, pro jobs, pro family, pro growth, and 100 pro American
trump, For decades and decades the permanent politicians in Washington pursued the very opposite
trump, They sold out our workers
trump, You see it
trump, You know it better than any place
trump, When I talk about the horrors of NAFTA, the horrors of trade deals… I mean, I'm sorry to tell you this, I usually refer to New Hampshire
trump, Nobody took it worse than new England and nobody took it worse than New Hampshire
trump, Now, here's the good news
trump, I would never let that happen again and Chris will never let that happen again
trump, Is there a doctor, please Doctor in the house Thank you
trump, Doctor in the house
trump, Please, doctor, please
trump, Thank you very much
trump, Take your time
trump, Yeah, take your time
trump, Thank you
trump, Take your time, fellas
trump, Plenty of time
trump, You know, people got here two and a half days ago, many of these people in the front, right Two and a half days ago, a lot of these people, so you can understand
trump, It's pretty tough
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you
trump, That's okay
trump, These are great people
trump, These are great people that love our country, just remember that
trump, Thank you very much
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you very much
trump, Pretty good
trump, Pretty good
trump, So our politicians shipped away our jobs, shed our sovereignty, surrendered our dignity, and saddled our nation in one foreign debacle after another, and we're still here
trump, He just said it
trump, We're still here, you better believe it, and we're here stronger than ever before we're here
trump, But all of that ended the day that I took the oath of office, the American people are in charge of their country again
trump, We cut a record number of job-killing regulations that were strangling our country
trump, We cut more regulations in two and a half years than any other president in their full terms
trump, Four years, eight years, or in one case more than that, cut more than anybody
trump, To get relief to working families we passed the largest package of tax cuts and tax reforms in the history of our country
trump, You're making a lot more money
trump, You're making a lot more money and you see it and you know it because you see it in your paycheck every week
trump, We ended the last administration's cruel war on American energy and we are delivering a policy of American energy independence like you've never seen before
trump, In fact, if you look at the straits where we're having all of the problems, you look at the straits, number one, they're not touching our ships, they're not playing with our ships
trump, They're taking them from this country, from that country, from that country
trump, But you know what Very importantly, we have very few ships going there anymore because we don't need that oil and gas
trump, The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world
trump, Every leading Democrat has pledged abolish the American oil, coal, and natural gas industries that are fueling our economic boom
trump, Can you imagine this We're sitting on great wealth
trump, They want to take it away from us, and the alternatives don't have the power
trump, They don't have the power
trump, They want wind, wind
trump, Wind is oh so beautiful, as long as you don't have to stare at a windmill and your house goes down in value like to nothing
trump, Steve, if you had a windmill anywhere near your house you would've gotten one third of the price you got, Steve
trump, That's true, by the way
trump, Steve's too smart to let that happen
trump, We won't let them take it away from you
trump, We are reversing decades of calamitous trade policies that shattered New Hampshire and your factories
trump, They shattered your communities and they shattered American power and American prestige all around the globe
trump, New Hampshire lost one in four manufacturing jobs following NAFTA and China's entrance into the Organization, two of the worst deals ever in the history of our world, not just our country
trump, Election after election, politicians came to your state pretending to have the courage to stand up for the American worker, then they went to Washington and let other countries push them around, and special interests, buy them off and steal your jobs and take your companies
trump, That's what happened
trump, Me, I don't care about their campaign contributions
trump, It doesn't matter to me, folks
trump, We want to do a job
trump, We want to do a great job, and we're setting records, and you know who's sending us the money The small donors
trump, Well, we have big donors, but we have small donors are sending us the money for the election
trump, Pretty amazing
trump, That's not supposed to happen to a Republican, but it's happening to this Republican and it's happening to you
trump, Every vow that politicians made was broken, every hope was dashed, and every promise turned into a total betrayal of New Hampshire and of our country
trump, But in this administration, we have something those sell-out politicians could only dream of
trump, It's called strength and commitment
trump, We don't play games
trump, We don't play games
trump, After years and years of building up other countries we are finally building up our country, standing up for our jobs, our workers, and standing up for our dignity
trump, The forgotten men and women of America will never ever be forgotten again
trump, You were forgotten
trump, The last administration with sleepy Joe and Obama tried to ram through one of the worst trade deals ever negotiated, worse than NAFTA, worse than WTO
trump, It was called the Trans-Pacific Partnership
trump, It would have been a disaster
trump, TPP would have gutted the American auto industry
trump, It would have been in shambles
trump, Our auto industry is coming back so strong
trump, It would've gutted, would've destroyed the industry
trump, But in my first week in office I proudly withdrew the United States from that job-destroying catastrophe
trump, We're imposing beautiful well-placed tariffs, money comes in, on foreign countries that cheat our workers, steal our jobs, and break all the rules, I'm sorry
trump, And by the way, they've been changing and charging tariffs on us for years
trump, We have countries that charge us 100, 200, 297 in the case of Canada with your farm products
trump, We're not going to stand for it, and man, did we turn things around and we've just started
trump, If companies don't want to pay a tariff, I have one simple solution
trump, Come make your product in America
trump, Come make your product in New Hampshire
trump, Zero tariffs
trump, Zero
trump, No tariff
trump, Together we're restoring this nation's industrial might and we are doing it with American iron, American aluminum, and American steel
trump, We're doing it steel
trump, Steel industry is high
trump, They were dumping steel all over
trump, They were destroying our companies
trump, US steel now, all of them, they're all expanding
trump, the steel industry is back
trump, It's doing great
trump, We're opening up mines in Minnesota, the great state of Minnesota
trump, They have magnificent mines that have the best iron ore in the world and President Obama closed them down
trump, Maybe we can get Representative Omar from Minnesota to open it up, but I don't think so
trump, She'll open them up
trump, I don't think so
trump, Representative Omar, that's another one
trump, We're replacing NAFTA with the brand new USMCA
trump, That's Mexico and Canada
trump, Great deal
trump, The USMCA will create countless jobs for farmers and manufacturers all across the state
trump, We need Congress to pass the USMCA immediately
trump, We'll make it a bipartisan deal
trump, We don't even want credit
trump, The unions benefit
trump, The non-unions benefit
trump, Everybody benefits
trump, It brings it back to fairness and it makes it very hard for our companies to leave our countries, go to Mexico or Canada
trump, We lose all our jobs
trump, We lose all our taxes
trump, We end up with empty factories and plants
trump, It makes it almost impossible
trump, We're not going to have that
trump, That was my one rule that I had to have
trump, It's going to be very, very hard for companies to do that
trump, I've also taken the toughest ever action to stand up to China's chronic trade abuses
trump, Earlier this month, the US government officially labeled China for the first time ever a currency manipulator, another promise kept
trump, While others allowed China to freely loot the US economy, 500 billion a year, not million, not million, billion with a B
trump, We've made it clear that the theft of American jobs and American wealth is over
trump, Yet today, the Wall Street Journal editorial board and some others continue to publish foolish articles that demonstrate that they understand nothing about trade or business
trump, Nothing
trump, They advocate only economic surrender
trump, They actually say, Go to China, take off the tariffs, make a deal
trump, I lose all the cards we take off the tariffs
trump, We don't have any cards
trump, Think of it
trump, They say Go to Europe
trump,
trump, By the way, the European union is worse than China, just smaller
trump, It treats us horribly
trump, Barriers, tariffs, taxes, and we let them come in
trump, It's worse than China
trump, Many of us come from there
trump, I do
trump, That's what it's got going
trump, That's about it
trump, They treat us really badly, and many others, many, many others
trump, India tariffs us probably higher than any nation anywhere in the world
trump, We have tariffs of 100 on products and much more than that
trump, India
trump, So we're working on all of them
trump, I called Prime Minister Modi
trump, I said, Mr
trump, Prime Minister, it's not fair
trump, We've got to change, we've got to change, we've got to change, and we're talking to them very seriously
trump, We're talking to a lot of places
trump, But when the Wall Street Journal comes out and they say,  No, no, take the tariffs
trump, Go and talk to China
trump, They've been trying to talk to them for 25 years
trump, But actually, you know what They really haven't
trump, The fact is the leaders that were in my position, they didn't do a damn thing
trump, They didn't talk
trump, They didn't talk
trump, Past leaders followed the terrible advice of these editorial boards that are frankly totally inexperienced in business, I guess, and our industries were utterly decimated
trump, Globalism enriches foreign countries at our expense
trump, Globalism
trump, I love our country
trump, I'm the President of the United States of America
trump, I'm not the president of the the world
trump, As long as I'm president, America will never bow to a foreign nation like we were for so many years
trump, As we restore our prosperity, we are also restoring public safety
trump, We are fighting to reduce violent crime
trump, You see so much, and over the last 25 years so much crime, and ensure that every American can live in safety and peace
trump, And yet with all that you see, we've had one of the best years of crime prevention that we've ever had
trump, It wouldn't seem that way, but it is one of the best years because those gentlemen that we just saw, the law enforcement, they do a great job
trump, You've been reading about this a lot lately
trump, We are working very hard to make sure we keep guns out of the hands of insane people and those who are mentally sick and shouldn't have guns
trump, But people have to remember, however, that there is a mental illness problem that has to be dealt with
trump, It's not the gun that pulls the trigger
trump, It's the person holding the gun
trump, Years ago, many cities and states, I remember it so well, closed mental institutions for budgetary reasons
trump, They let those people out onto the street
trump, You probably have your examples up here
trump, I can tell you in New York they closed so many of them and they let really seriously mentally ill people out on the streets, and you see plenty of them today, even today
trump, We're going to have to give major consideration to building new facilities for those in need
trump, We have to do it
trump, And at the same time, we will be taking mentally deranged and dangerous people off of… … Mentally deranged and dangerous people off of the streets so we won't have to worry so much about that
trump, The big problem
trump, We don't have those institutions anymore and people can't get proper care
trump, They're seriously ill people and they're on the streets
trump, We can't make it harder for good, solid law abiding citizens to protect themselves
trump, We will always uphold the right to self defense and we will always uphold the second amendment
trump, We will
trump, So important
trump, One of the most powerful promises I made to the people of this state was to confront the opioid and drug epidemic
trump, I used to go around New Hampshire more than any state and you'd say, Sir, the state is infested
trump, You said, Sir, we'll like a drug den
trump, You tell me
trump, And I didn't really see it
trump, And then I met with the police officers and fire departments and all the people that do
trump, And you just seem to have a bigger problem
trump, And by the way, the wall is being built
trump, That's- That's going to stop a lot of it
trump, The wall is being built
trump, Build the wall
trump, Build the wall
trump, Build the wall
trump, Build the wall
trump, Build the wall
trump, Build the wall
trump, Build the wall
trump, It's being built
trump, You know, we have the fake news
trump, You know about that, where they … A wall that's lying on the ground in a very important section
trump, So we pick up the wall, it's in pieces
trump, I mean literally it's gone and we build a brand new 30 foot steel and concrete wall and the fake media said, He didn't build a wall
trump, That's just renovation
trump, There was no wall, it's lying on the ground
trump, People walk right over and it's rotted, rusted, gone
trump, We take it away
trump, We put a brand new wall up
trump, They give me no credit
trump, You know why Because they're fake news
trump, That's why
trump, We're building a lot of walls
trump, The Army Corps of Engineers is doing a great job
trump, They're doing a great job
trump, Since I took office, we've attacked the challenge with everything we have
trump, We have secured a record 6 billion in new funding
trump, Opioid
trump, We vastly increase the distribution of overdose reversing drugs, which are pretty amazing things
trump, We've given them to your police department, your fire department, pretty amazing
trump, We have reduced the total amount of opioids prescribed by 34
trump, The department of justice has prosecuted more than 3000 defendants in opioids related cases
trump, And our public awareness campaign about the terrible suffering that drugs inflict has already reached 58 of all young Americans
trump, I said that you have to show them
trump, We're doing ads beautiful ads
trump, Shows them, and you've seen them
trump, I don't even want to describe them
trump, They're brutal
trump, But we're doing ads on television and papers about how bad it is for children so they can see it
trump, Because the greatest thing we can do is not get people started on drugs, right
trump, Not get them started
trump, It's hard to get off
trump, You know, we can get them off and we're doing it and it's been done
trump, But it's hard to get off
trump, If they never start
trump, It's real easy
trump, It's real easy
trump, So we're trying to get young kids, you won't see the fruits of this labor for a little while because it takes a while
trump, But we're really, we are working so hard on advertising and promotions to tell young kids, children how bad drugs are, how dangerous they are, how horrible they are, how they destroy your brain, how they do so many bad things
trump, And they're really very tough ads
trump, They're hard hitting ads
trump, And I think they're having a big impact
trump, You'll see over time you'll see
trump, Over time you'll see
trump, But we still have much work to do
trump, But as a result of these efforts, last year we saw the first nationwide decline in drug overdose deaths in 31 years
trump, That's pretty amazing
trump, And at the center of America's drug crisis is the border crisis
trump, Vast quantities of deadly narcotics are being smuggled across the border including meth, cocaine, heroin and fentanyl
trump, And as part of my trade deal with China, it's been very important
trump, And President Xi said he's going to do it
trump, So far he has not done it
trump, But I said, You have to stop sending us fentanyl
trump, Have to
trump, And you have to criminalize in China the making of fentanyl
trump, And so far he has not come through, but I think he will
trump, You'll know, you'll know
trump, Yet Democrats want to open borders and Republicans want strong borders
trump, That you're difference
trump, One wants open borders
trump, Who can even think of an open border Think of it Even though many people that come into our country are wonderful people, they're are still coming in illegally
trump, They're not coming in through merit
trump, But what about the bad ones We have serious, serious criminals that want to come in, and if we had open borders they would be flowing in like you've never seen before
trump, Democrats want open borders, they don't mind crime
trump, We do mind crime and that's the way it is
trump, Democrats also support deadly sanctuary cities
trump, Last year alone sanctuary cities declined more than 17,000 requests from federal authorities to hand over criminal aliens already in their custody
trump, In other words, 17,000 criminal aliens were released by these cities directly into US communities
trump, You don't understand even what the hell are they doing What are they doing 17,000
trump, Republicans believe our city should be sanctuaries for law abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens
trump, We will always support the amazing heroes of ICE and Border Patrol, and we will always support law enforcement
trump, Every Democrat candidate also wants to give illegal immigrants free welfare
trump, Republicans believe public benefits should be protected for truly needy Americans, not for illegal aliens
trump, And we should reduce our taxes and many other things with all of that money that we're talking about
trump, We need to elect a strong Republican majority to end sanctuary cities
trump, Stop human traffickers, stop drug smugglers and adopt an immigration system that puts the needs of American workers and families first
trump, It's also time for Democrats to join with us to protect the sacred integrity of our elections by supporting voter ID, voter identification
trump, It's incredible
trump, They're constantly saying, Oh, we need to protect them
trump, But they're not looking for that
trump, They're not looking for that
trump, We say, What about voter ID In other words, you have a picture, you have to go up
trump, What about voter ID That they don't want to do, but we need voter ID
trump, The Democrat party has never been farther outside the mainstream
trump, Where do they come from You know, you say you want low taxes, good education, strong military, strong borders
trump, You want to have safe homes
trump, You want a house, you want low interest rates, you've got low … Hey, you got low interest rates
trump, The lowest ever
trump, Got low rates, it's a good time to refinance your house, by the way
trump, Great time
trump, You got everything, and then you see these people they're against … They have no idea what they're doing
trump, They have no idea what they're against
trump, Every major Democrat running for president supports a massive government takeover of healthcare that would raid Medicare and destroy the private health insurance plans of millions of American families that they love
trump, My administration is defending your right to choose the plan and the doctor that is best for you
trump, The individual mandate is gone
trump, The most unpopular part of Obamacare, and we almost have Obamacare gone
trump, We're close
trump, We would have had it before, but we had a vote that was a little bit surprising
trump, I'm sure none of you knew who that vote was
trump, We had it done, repealed and replaced
trump, But it's going to happen and I think it's going to actually be in the end, actually better
trump, You watch
trump, So we got rid of the individual mandate, which was the most unpopular part of Obamacare
trump, And we're running it better
trump, You know, I had a political decision
trump, Do I make it great Alex Azar our secretary, do rerun it well and sort of say, Hey, we run it well
trump, Or do we run it badly and have everybody upset We said, we got to run it well, but it's still much too expensive
trump, It's lousy healthcare
trump, But we got rid of the worst part of it
trump, Individual mandate, individual mandate, where you have the privilege of buying the right not to have to pay for expensive insurance
trump, that's no good health insurance
trump, And we won't … And you got to remember this
trump, Republicans, and I speak for every one of them, we will always protect pre-existing conditions
trump, We're going to protect, always
trump, Right, got to do it
trump, Our ambitious campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs has produced the largest decline in drug prices in 51 years
trump, The only decline in 51 years
trump, We have launched a historic initiative to require price transparency, empowering you to choose the lowest price for yourself and for your family
trump, Believe it or not, you didn't have the right to go in and price your drugs
trump, Who could even believe this I wonder if big pharma had something to do with that
trump, So we're going to have transparency
trump, Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mothers womb
trump, Right up, up till … Right up until the moment of birth
trump, And in the case of the Virginia governor, he's having a rough, rough time
trump, In his case, the baby is born, and then he goes to talk to the mother
trump, The doctor talks to the mother
trump, The baby is now born, wrapped as he said, and then they decide whether or not to execute the baby
trump, Who would believe that
trump, That is why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred, the gift of God
trump, Hard to believe isn't that
trump, Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion and socialism
trump, The Republican party is the party of freedom
trump, We are the party of the American worker, the American family, and the American dream and I'm fighting for you each and every day
trump, So importantly we have confirmed more than 140 federal judges
trump, Within 90 days it will be 179 federal judges
trump, Thank you very much President Obama
trump, Thank you very much
trump, I don't know what happened to them, but I came to office and I had 138 judges that were not appointed by President Obama
trump, So I say, thank you Mr
trump, President, very good and they'll say he was a great president
trump, Oh, the fake news
trump, He was a great president
trump, If he was a great president how come he left me 138 judges to appoint when everybody says that's the single most important thing a president of the United States has to do
trump, Great president
trump, He was great
trump, He was a great president
trump, And these judges will apply the law as written, including we appointed two great Supreme Court Justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh
trump, And to help patients with life threatening illnesses we also pass something I'm so proud of, 44 years they couldn't get it passed, right to try
trump, You can use our newest, our best medicines
trump, Incredible
trump, What's happening
trump, I'm so proud of that
trump, And this from forever, five decades
trump, We pass for our great veterans VA choice and VA accountability
trump, And one of our great friends was a veteran who's been with me in New Hampshire
trump, I don't know where you are
trump, Where's our guy Where is he So, Al
trump, So, I walk in I said, hello
trump, He's been with me from the beginning
trump, He wasn't with … He liked Trump
trump, And I came in
trump, He said, sir, he's a great veteran
trump, He said, Sir, I have cancer
trump, And sir, I went into the vet
trump, They were very, very late
trump, They had problems
trump, I'm not blaming them, but they gave me the right to go out and get a great cancer surgeon
trump, He had his operation
trump, You look much better than you did three years ago Al, much better
trump, Much better
trump, VA choice, right Al
trump, VA choice
trump, Great story
trump, Thank you very much, and thank you for your loyalty
trump, He's been to every rally I ever gave a New Hampshire right from the beginning
trump, I got so tired of looking at him
trump, He'd always be here
trump, Now he's … Look at him, now he's sitting in very good
trump, That's good
trump, But I appreciate that story
trump, I appreciate
trump, VA choice just makes sense, right Doesn't it make sense We've achieved record funding for the United States military
trump, 716 billion, 700 billion and 738 billion
trump, And it's almost completely rebuilt
trump, Including, and we hope to God we never have do use it
trump, We have the finest, most powerful nuclear capability anywhere on the face of the earth
trump, And I hope to God we never have to use it
trump, We're investing in the future of human space flight
trump, And someday soon American astronauts will plant the stars and stripes on the surface of Mars
trump, I told my guys at NASA, you know, NASA, when we took it over, it was exhausted
trump, The runways and the grounds had all weeds growing through the cracks in the concrete
trump, You wouldn't recognize it now
trump, It's beautiful
trump, It's the best place anywhere on earth
trump, And I also said, though, you know, I hear all these rich guys for some reason, they love space
trump, So they're rich
trump, I said, let them send the rockets up
trump, What the hell do we have to do it Right So I see Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, they're putting rockets up
trump, I think it's great
trump, And they pay us rent
trump, They use our facility
trump, That's great
trump, But we're also doing it, and NASA has some of the greatest plans we've ever had
trump, These are great people, great scientists
trump, But we also let the private sector put up rockets
trump, The one which recently went up and you see the engines coming back down and they coming … There's no wings, no nothing
trump, It's almost like, what are we watching is this fiction And they come down and they save all of the propellants
trump, All of the, really the most expensive parts
trump, They're able to save it by bringing it back right to where it took off
trump, Who would think they could do this I never saw this before six months ago, but they're doing it now more and more
trump, They're saving a lot of the most important and expensive parts of rockets
trump, So we have a lot of rich guys paying us a lot of rent
trump, But we're also doing it ourselves
trump, To protect America's security
trump, I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal
trump, I recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem
trump, And just three months ago, we also recognized the Golan Heights as being a part of and protected by Israel
trump, For years you watched as your politicians apologized for America
trump, Now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the people of New Hampshire
trump, Thank you
trump, And you must never forget the 2020 election right around the corner
trump, 2020 right around the corner
trump, And it's about one thing
trump, You know what the one thing is, you
trump, It's about you
trump, It's about your family
trump, It's about your future
trump, And it's about the fate of your country
trump, So when we ran together last time, we said the most importantly we had to turn it around
trump, This country was going bad
trump, You see what happened to Venezuela with socialism Venezuela 15 years ago was one of the richest countries
trump, Now they don't have water, they don't have food, they don't have anything
trump, And this was one of the richest nations in the world
trump, They don't have anything
trump, We're working on it
trump, We're helping people, but it's very sad
trump, It's never going to happen to us because we will never ever be a socialist nation
trump, Ever
trump, No matter what label they use, a vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction … The destruction of the American dream
trump, We have a dream
trump, It's a great dream
trump, This the destruction of the American dream
trump, We begin this campaign tonight with the best record, the best results, the best agenda, and the only positive vision for the people of New Hampshire and for the people of America
trump, Together we will lift millions more citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity
trump, Millions and millions of people
trump, With your help, we will elect a Republican Congress to create a safe, modern, fair and lawful system of immigration
trump, We will enact trade deals that are already happening that ensure more products are proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase made in the USA
trump, We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, ending the AIDS epidemic in America and finding new cures for childhood cancer
trump, Something I never thought I'd be able to say, within one decade the AIDS epidemic in the United States will be gone
trump, Think of that
trump, Did you ever think you were going to hear that No
trump, Did you ever think you were going to hear that The work they've done on AIDs is incredible
trump, That's an incredible thing
trump, When they told me that, it's just shattering
trump, It just, it breaks your heart what's happened
trump, But think of it in 10 years, the AIDS epidemic will be eradicated
trump, So great
trump, Who thought that was going to be happening
trump, Who thought I'd be able to get to say that so early in what we're doing together
trump, We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious Liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms
trump, Above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together
trump, There is one America we will support, protect and defend the constitution of the United States
trump, We'll stand with the incredible men and women of law enforcement
trump, We believe in the dignity of work and in the sanctity of life
trump, We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the true American way
trump, We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag
trump, Through every day and every challenge our hearts speak to the words of the New Hampshire state motto, live free or die
trump, We are fighting for every American mom and dad who wants to protect this land of Liberty for their precious, beautiful children
trump, We are fighting for every young boy and girl who deserves to grow up in a nation of builders and dreamers, pioneers and patriots, and we are fighting for every citizen of the greatest Republic on the face of this earth
trump, Every day my presidency, we will never forget that we are Americans and the future belongs to us
trump, The brave this beautiful, strong, proud, and free future
trump, It belongs to us
trump, It's up to us
trump, We control our own destiny
trump, And with your help, your devotion and your drive
trump, We are going to keep on working
trump, We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning
trump, We are one great movement
trump, One people, one family and one glorious nation under God
trump, And together we are making America wealthy again
trump, We are making America strong again
trump, We are making America safe again
trump, And we are making America great again
trump, Thank you
trump, New Hampshire
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you
trump,
trump,Hello, everybody
trump, Hello, everybody
trump, Wow
trump, Hello, everybody
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you
trump, And I'll tell you, we're landing and there are thousands of people along the runways, and I said, Why aren't they here Sir, we couldn't let them in
trump, Why not Let's let them in
trump, Oh, these people
trump, And then they put in a floor
trump, This is for Manchester because you know about flooring
trump, They put in a floor that's like an ice skating rink
trump, So we're going to tiptoe around
trump, How are you, everybody We love you
trump, We love you
trump, Great, great people
trump, Manchester, we had some good memories in Manchester
trump, 2016, but this is going to be, we are right now in the most important election in our history
trump, But I'm thrilled to be back in the Granite State with the true hard-working American Patriots
trump, Last night it was my great honor to accept the Republican nomination for President of the United States
trump, We're going to win
trump, We're going to win
trump, Does anybody have any doubt Does anybody… It's very interesting, last night we had an incredible time and I don't know if you know, it's driving the fake news crazy
trump, They're back
trump, But the poll numbers have swung
trump, If you go back six months before the plague flew in from China, the plague, the horrible plague, this election was over
trump, This election was over
trump, And then I had to go back to work
trump, I had to go back to work
trump, And then I went back to work and we've done an incredible job in every aspect of running government, but I also had to start campaigning a little bit again, and I did
trump, And today it was announced that Joe Biden is coming out of the basement
trump, Because the poll numbers have totally swung
trump, They totally swung
trump, And they've swung like nobody's ever seen them swing before
trump, And it was rapid
trump, It was a rapid swing
trump, Because they all admit that we're doing a great job
trump, There's not too many presidents that have done a job like we've done, including keeping you out of wars, bringing you home from the endless wars
trump, But they've swung
trump, But here's what I don't get
trump, Sleepy Joe's coming out he said in 10 days, that's a long… 10 days
trump, 10 days
trump, That's like an eternity in Trumpville
trump, 10 days
trump, I view 10 days is like an eternity, okay So he decided he's coming out and he's going to be out in 10 days
trump, That's a long time
trump, That's a big percentage of the remaining time
trump, That's all right, he's much better off where he is
trump, I think he's, I think he just… And how about those stories from friends of mine How about those stories Was that just compelling and incredible television, but really that was an exciting, a really good quality convention
trump, Really great
trump, So many people
trump, So many people, you saw some tragic situations, some really great endorsements, you saw everything
trump, If you… How about the endorsement of Herschel Walker When you watch that that was from the heart
trump, That was from the heart
trump, Dana White today
trump, I just saw it today because last night I was looking at this speech a little bit
trump, We had a wonderful turnout last night
trump, What I didn't like, you saw this right, when it was over, you saw when it was over The thugs outside because the Democratic mayor of Washington DC, it's another Democrat that's not believing in law and order
trump, And you know we give Washington DC a lot of money to run it, but they don't do a good job of running it
trump, The mayor, she doesn't run anything
trump, And these incredible people from all over the country, all over the world that were there last night, they walked out to a bunch of thugs
trump, And that wasn't, remember this, that wasn't friendly protesters
trump, They were thugs
trump, They were thugs
trump, And the DC police are good, but the mayor gave bad instructions last night, that should have never been allowed to happen
trump, When a senator like Rand Paul walks out, and thank God we had some good police around him and they took a tremendous… They took tremendous abuse
trump, And Rand Paul was in big trouble last night, he's a good guy, he's a friend of mine, and that shouldn't happen to anybody
trump, But he is a US senator walking outside and those four policemen should be brought over to the White House and we ought to give them a medal of some kind, and we're going to do it
trump, We're going to do it
trump, I told that to Rand
trump, And the mayor should be ashamed of herself for that kind of a display of incompetence because that's what's happening in Portland
trump, And that's what's happening all over where you have Democrat-run cities
trump, Just take a look
trump, And we're looking at the whole situation in DC, and tonight they have a lot of people gathering, let's see how that works out
trump, They have to be able to manage their affairs, they get a lot of money
trump, She's always looking for money, Could we have more money What are you going to waste it on I mean spend it on
trump, What are you going to waste it on, Mayor And then our people walk out, and these are people from all over the world, they walk, including Congress, by the way, they walk out and they get accosted, they get abused, they get spit on
trump, It's a disgrace
trump, And our country is going to change
trump, We're not going to allow that to happen
trump, You know, we're not supposed to be… We're not supposed to be involved unless we're invited in by the people that run, these are all Democrat cities, just so you understand, including DC
trump, So we're not supposed to go in unless we call it an insurrection, but that's a big statement
trump, It's a big statement
trump, No reason for it
trump, But you know what we're going to do We're going to have to look at it
trump, Mark Meadows is here, we're going to have to look at it because we're not going to let that happen to people that go to the White House to celebrate our country
trump, And a weak guy named Joe Biden, and he's weak, he's weak as hell, a weak guy like Joe Biden didn't even bring law and order up as a subject for discussion in the entire Democrat National Convention
trump, Now they're all of a sudden… Now they realize because they've gone down like a rock in water, they've gone down in the polls and now all of a sudden they're talking all, Well, we have to talk about crime
trump, Number one, they have no… Look at what happened to New York, look at what's going on in Chicago, all Democrats, all radical left Democrats
trump, Look at what's going on in the great State of Wisconsin
trump, Now I will tell you, two days ago we sent in the National Guard
trump, That was the end of that problem
trump, Look at Portland
trump, We want to send in the National Guard, we sent in Homeland Security just to protect our… couple of our buildings, including a courthouse, can you believe it We sent in because- … couple of our buildings, including a courthouse
trump, Can you believe it We send in because they can't protect it
trump, So we sent, they did a very effective job
trump, We could take care of Portland in 45 minutes, 45 minutes
trump, If that governor, if that mayor would call and say, Please send in the National Guard
trump, just like … Hey, we did it in Minneapolis
trump, Remember that The place was going to burn down
trump, Another few days, we send in the National Guard, it was over within an hour
trump, They ought to get smart and that's what they ought to do
trump, So now they're talking about, Well, we want to … Why did they call it a friendly protest Right Remember the idiot from CNN, he's standing there
trump, This is a friendly protest
trump, Behind him over his shoulders, the entire city is burning down
trump, Sixty seven days from now, we're going to win the great state of New Hampshire
trump, We have to
trump, We're going to win four more years in the White House
trump, Within my first term in office, we've secured America's borders, brought back our manufacturing jobs, rebuilt the United States military
trump, It was a mess
trump, It was a depleted mess
trump, Wiped out the ISIS caliphate, killed our terrorists enemies, kept America out of foolish, stupid, ridiculous foreign wars
trump, Achieved American energy independence
trump, You see the price of your gasoline
trump, When you go fill it up, Oh boy, that's a nice price
trump, It's half what it was
trump, We built the single greatest economy in the history of the world
trump, That includes China, which was having a very, very bad year
trump, Then the plague came in from China
trump, We had to close it up
trump, We saved millions of lives and now we're open again and we're setting records
trump, We're setting records
trump, Wait till you see the numbers just before the election
trump, There'll be released and this is despite the fact that the Democrats are holding back Michigan, North Carolina
trump, You take a look
trump, Pennsylvania
trump, They want to keep them
trump, By the way, on November 4th, regardless, they'll be opening them up, November 4th, because they think that hurts the economy and that will hurt me, but our numbers are going to be great
trump, We're going to have a great third quarter
trump, We're going to have an unbelievable next year, unless somebody stupid gets elected and raises your taxes
trump, This November, each of you will vote in truly the most important election in the history of our country
trump, I used to say it about 2016
trump, This is now at a new level
trump, Joe Biden is the puppet of the radical left movement that seeks to obliterate and destroy everything that you hold here including your second amendment, which will have no chance
trump, Your vote will decide whether we save the American dream or whether we allow Biden to eliminate your jobs
trump, By the way, it's not Biden
trump, It's not Biden
trump, It's his masters, his … They tell him what to do, his masters
trump, They want to erase your borders, confiscate your guns, appoint radical left judges and prosecutors, tear down our history
trump, Demolish your suburbs
trump, You saw what I did
trump, I ended the rule
trump, You're not going to have low income housing built in your suburbs anymore, but nobody writes that because the fake news doesn't want to write that, but everyone knows
trump, Unless our friends in the suburbs have gotten a lot dumber than they used to be, they know that
trump, They want to destroy your suburbs, indoctrinate our children, defund the police and try everything in the book to turn our cities so that they look more like Portland, Oregon than what we're used to looking at
trump, Never forget, they are coming after me because I am fighting for you
trump, It's true
trump, Today's Democrat party is filled with hate
trump, Just look at Joe Biden supporters on the streets screaming and shouting at bystanders with unhinged manic rage
trump, Right You see it
trump, It's crazy
trump, It's crazy
trump, You ought to see last night in Washington
trump, It was a disgrace
trump, It was a disgrace that these people are representing the United States of America
trump, It was a disgrace
trump, Protesters
trump, You know what I say Protest is your ass
trump, I don't talk about my ass
trump, They're not protestors
trump, Those aren't … Those are anarchists
trump, They're agitators
trump, They're rioters
trump, They're looters
trump, They're not … You know you say that and some of the people, not all of them, but some of the people back there, Oh, how dare you
trump, These are friendly protesters, right Friendly … They're just looking for trouble
trump, Has nothing to do with George Floyd
trump, Has nothing to do with anything
trump, They don't even know who George Floyd is
trump, Okay They don't know who George Floyd
trump, They have no idea
trump, If you ask them, Who's George Floyd They couldn't even tell you
trump, These are just bad people, troublemakers and they shouldn't be representing our country at important events and we've got to stop it
trump, Democrats have no complaint about the rioters and the vandals, marauding through our cities or mass unruly demonstrations, but they don't believe law abiding citizens can go to a church together
trump, You can't go to church anymore
trump, You know how many churches are closed in this country because of the Democrats You can go out and you can have thousands of people marauding through the streets, threatening other people, beyond threatening, kicking them in the face, doing what they've done
trump, You've seen it
trump, They would have done that to Senator Rand Paul last night
trump, He'd either be in very bad shape or dead and that would include his wife if those policemen didn't happen to be there
trump, They took some big beating
trump, The reason they didn't fight back too much, they don't want to lose their pension
trump, They don't want to lose their job, because we've become so politically correct, everybody's afraid to do anything now, but they did a good job
trump, The puppet Biden, who's just controlled so strongly wants you to cancel weddings, funerals and school, but has no problem with thousands of so-called peaceful protesters cramming into your streets, mugging people, hurting people, robbing stores, looting stores, burning down storefronts
trump, The radical left will do anything to get power
trump, They smear justice, Brett Kavanaugh, and they are … Did you see anything like that Justice Kavanaugh
trump, People forget
trump, Time goes by, they forget
trump, We don't forget
trump, I don't forget
trump, They're destroying the livelihoods of innocent people and if Biden wins, which I honestly can't believe can happen
trump, I will have lost to a low IQ individual
trump, I don't want that
trump, I don't want it
trump, Sleepy Joe, I don't want it
trump, But the agitators will go from rioting in the streets to running the halls of government
trump, Can you believe it The levers, they call it the levers of government
trump, The top 10 most dangerous cities in America are run by Democrats and have been for decades
trump, Now they're trying to impose those policies across the entire country
trump, No one will be safe in Biden's America
trump, I can't even call it Biden's America
trump, God doesn't know he's alive
trump, He's going to be out in 10 days
trump, He's going to start 10 days
trump, Ten days
trump, I mean, I gave a big speech last night
trump, I said, What am I doing tomorrow night You're going to New Hampshire, but sir, we can cancel New Hampshire because you had a big night
trump, We can cancel
trump, Are you crazy I don't have the courage to cancel New Hampshire
trump, I got to win New Hampshire
trump, I love the people and you've been very good to me
trump, You've been very good to me
trump, You've been very good to me
trump, So, New Hampshire was the first state I won
trump, Right Remember, I came here
trump, I was very excited
trump, That was an exciting evening
trump, That was an exciting race, but we don't talk about that anymore
trump, We have to talk about the future
trump, We don't talk about it
trump, That was great
trump, It was important
trump, We've done more than any administration in its first three and a half years in the history of our country
trump, That's despite phony witch hunts, phony investigations, a phony impeachment based on a phone call that was absolutely perfect
trump, That's despite a pandemic that was probably sent in by China, who the hell knows how it got here and all over the world, because China does not want to see me win I can tell you that
trump, We're not happy with China
trump, I'll tell you why
trump, If Biden got in, China would own the United States very quickly
trump, They'd own it
trump, If the Democrat party wants to stand with anarchist, criminals, rioters, looters, and flag burners, that's up to them
trump, The Republican party and you, I can see you
trump, Is there anybody in this place that enjoys burning the American flag Is there anybody Please quietly raise your hand
trump, Be careful
trump, Could be very dangerous
trump, The Republican party will remain the voice of the patriotic heroes who keep America safe and our law enforcement
trump, Right We are all that stand between the American people and the left wing mob
trump, If you want to save democracy from the mob, then you must vote to defeat an extremely poor candidate
trump, Look, I believe I have the honor of running against the worst candidate ever put up by the Democratic party, the worst
trump, How do you get worse I believe he's the worst candidate, the slowest candidate
trump, I mean, in prime time, he was the slowest candidate, which was a long time ago
trump, Primetime
trump, You know what I don't like though, they say he's like 78, 79, 78, I guess
trump, Right I know people that are 85, that are 88, 92, Bernie Marcus, Home Depot, he's 92 years old
trump, He's the sharpest guy you'll ever meet
trump, There's nothing … 78 is okay, but that's a bad 78, not a good 78
trump, 78 is okay, but he shouldn't say that
trump, They shouldn't say … The press, they say he's too old
trump, He's not too old
trump, He's not too old, but 78 is okay, but I do
trump, I know people in their 90s that are 100 sharp and good physically, actually good physically
trump, You want debate So do I
trump, I want debates too
trump, I want debates too
trump, Tonight, we're honored to be joined by New Hampshire House Republican leader, Dick Hinch

trump, You can go over at taxes and you can go over what we've done with the military
trump, We passed the biggest tax cuts ever, ever the history of our country
trump, Now, they want to raise taxes
trump, Think of it
trump, All my life, I've watched politicians
trump, Don't forget, I've only been doing this for four and a half years
trump, I haven't been to … I've had senators come in
trump, I've had congressmen come in
trump, Sir, I've been doing this for 25 years and in 25 years I've only lost three races, sir
trump, I said, But I've only been doing it for four years and I only won one race, but now I have to win two
trump, One race I won, but it was the president
trump, It was for president
trump, It was for president, but we did the largest tax cut in the history of our country
trump, We eliminated the most job destroying regulations in the history of our country
trump, I ended the job killing Paris climate accord
trump, That was a killer
trump, That was meant to hurt the United States
trump, By the way, in case you had any questions
trump, Today, the United States is the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on earth
trump, To give critically ill patients access to lifesaving cures we passed and hopefully anybody here doesn't need it
trump, Nobody here
trump, Uh-oh, do you need it Uh-oh
trump, Don't raise that … Oh she is Is she okay I'll get it for her
trump, Is she okay We got to get her on the list
trump, Tell me
trump, Oh, from before
trump, Well, that's a long time before I was president
trump, Does she want to get on the list Because I've seen you at rallies before
trump, I want to get … Will you please, I want to get his wife on the list
trump, It's called right to try
trump, Right to try
trump, Good work
trump, He's been a friend of mine
trump, Come on
trump, He's been here for a long time
trump, He's been a good guy for a long time
trump, We got to … Is your wife, how she doing She couldn't get it before me
trump, Well, we had that with Mueller
trump, You saw that with the Mueller's last night
trump, You saw that, right Was that Assad with their incredible daughter, what happened He said if Trump was president that wouldn't have happened and they're right, that would not have happened
trump, We took out al-Baghdadi
trump, I wish I were president, you would had a different solution
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you
trump, Go ahead
trump, How about you Yeah
trump, We'll talk to you later
trump, Right to try
trump, You have no idea
trump, So many people, they used to travel all over the world to get a cure
trump, Now, we can sign a quick simple document
trump, It sounds easy, it wasn't, but it was easy for me
trump, I understood it
trump, Now, you signed a document
trump, We give you the greatest medicines even if they haven't been approved
trump, If somebody's terminally ill, like in the case of your wife, if somebody's terminally ill, at least you have hope, but it's beyond that because people have gone home
trump, You have to see some of the results have been incredible
trump, You saw one of the people the other day, right That wonderful young lady that was so incredible and spoke so well
trump, She's a special person
trump, She really is a special person
trump, Thank you
trump, We'll talk to you
trump, Thank you very much
trump, To bring opportunities to our inner cities, I signed the groundbreaking criminal justice reform, prison reform, opportunity zones, permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities
trump, True
trump, Before the China virus came in, before that China virus came in, we had the best job numbers ever recorded the history of our country
trump, We had almost 160 million Americans working
trump, We had never had numbers like that
trump, The Republican party is the party of Abraham Lincoln
trump, Remember that
trump, We- We stand for so much, including Martin Luther King's dream of a nation where our children are judged not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character
trump, You know that
trump, The radical left's effort to divide everyone by race tears us apart
trump, There's so much racial hatred, and it's put there by CNN, by MSDNC… They stoke the flames and they know it
trump, The good news is the ratings aren't great
trump, So that's okay
trump, They don't have great ratings
trump, But they stoke the flames
trump, Uh-oh, CNN just turned off their camera again
trump, They always turn off their camera
trump, Why do I keep doing that Every time I do it, they turn off their camera
trump, They did it last time
trump, I mention CNN, they're screaming, turn the camera off
trump, Our movement is about a brighter future for all Americans of every race, religion, color, and creed
trump, Joe Biden spent the last 47 years betraying the African American community
trump, I've spent the last four years delivering for the African American community like nobody, with the exception possibly of Abraham Lincoln, has delivered before
trump, It's true
trump, My first week in office, I withdrew the United States from the last administration's horrible, stupid, insane Trans Pacific Partnership
trump, Would've destroyed the US auto industry and many other industries
trump, New Hampshire lost one in four, and I think much more than that, manufacturing jobs following twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance into the WTO
trump, It was more than one in four
trump, That statistic is wrong
trump, Please have it changed
trump, The statistic is wrong, far more than one in four
trump, Earlier this year, I kept my promise and replaced the NAFTA nightmare with a brand new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement
trump, They said that couldn't be done
trump, I also took the toughest ever action to stand up to China's pillaging and plundering of American jobs
trump, Joe Biden's agenda is made in China
trump, My agenda is made in America
trump, After years of building up other nations, we are finally building up our nation and our jobs, and we're taking care of our people
trump, Last night, I got great reviews of the speech and all, but some of the fakers back there, they said, Well, it was a little long
trump, He shouldn't have used the White House
trump, Oh really Tell me
trump, But they said it was a little… Then one person, I think it was Chris Wallace
trump, Nice guy
trump, He's actually a nice guy
trump, He said that, He didn't have the same energy in the speech that he usually has
trump, Well, it's a different kind of a speech
trump, Tonight, I'm in New Hampshire and we can wing it
trump, See, actually, actually Chris, who has always wanted to be his father, but it never worked out because of a lack of talent
trump, Actually though, actually Chris has it wrong
trump, If I did last night's speech here, by now you would have all been walking out
trump, And if I did tonight's speech there, I would have been criticized by being slightly radical
trump, But we're having a good time doing it this way, right Because we are finally putting America first
trump, Under my administration, America's borders are more secure than ever before
trump, We ended the catch and release, stopped asylum fraud
trump, And we have deported 20,000 gang members and 500,000 criminal aliens
trump, We've already built 300 miles of border wall and we're adding 10 new miles every single week
trump, The wall will soon be completed
trump, And our numbers on the border are the best they've ever been
trump, And by the way, Mexico is paying for the wall
trump, Just in case you didn't know that
trump, They don't know that
trump, They're paying for the wall
trump, You haven't noticed on the wall
trump, Everything was wall, wall
trump, They didn't think I was going to get it done
trump, Because look, you have one major party controlling Congress and they don't want to give me a wall
trump, So they're going crazy
trump, Wall
trump, The wall's not getting done
trump, Then I get it done
trump, Get it from the military, get it from everything
trump, I'm a developer
trump, I know how to get money
trump, It's one of those
trump, Developers understand
trump, And now that the wall is almost complete, it'll be soon complete
trump, And it's the wall that border security wanted so badly
trump, This is the one
trump, But now that it's built, you never hear about the wall
trump, They don't talk about it anymore
trump, They don't talk about it anymore
trump, It's incredible
trump, But the wall will soon be complete
trump, We've invested 2
trump,5 trillion in the US military and launched the first new branch of the US Armed Forces in nearly 75 years
trump, The space force
trump, And Al, in honor of you, we have passed VA Choice and VA Accountability, Al
trump, That guy's been bugging me for years
trump, Al has been bugging me
trump, What's in that hat, Al Let me see
trump, Let me… It's something
trump, Al, he's been bugging me for years
trump, Did you ever think we'd get VA Choice, VA Accountability Did you ever really believe it Thank you, Al
trump, I withdrew from the last administration's disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal, a disaster
trump, 150 billion we paid Iran for a basically short term deal
trump, And we gave them… What's more impressive, we also gave them 1
trump,8 billion in cash
trump, Cash
trump, Many plane loads
trump, You know what that took Many, many plane loads, 1
trump,8 billion
trump, I said bad
trump, That's when I realized how powerful a president is in the United States
trump, When a president has the right, which by the way, I don't believe he did have that right, okay When a president has the right to go into the banks and take out 1
trump,8 billion and hand it to people that hate our guts, that's power
trump, That's power
trump, I don't believe he had the right to do it
trump, I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the US embassy in Jerusalem
trump, I recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights and we achieved the first breakthrough in the Middle East in 25 years
trump, You saw that just last week
trump, UAE, highly respected
trump, Mohamed, highly respected
trump, UAE and Israel
trump, And now they're all going to be coming in
trump, Now they're all saying, How come you didn't tell us about this You'll have peace in the Middle East
trump, And yet we're moving our trips out
trump, It's pretty amazing, actually
trump, We'll get no credit for it, but that's all right
trump, Remember that Kaitlan
trump, Cover that properly, Kaitlan
trump, We like Kaitlan
trump, Together, we've spent the last four years cleaning up 47 years of Biden disasters
trump, Joe Biden has spent his entire career on the wrong side of history
trump, He supported NAFTA
trump, China's entry
trump, He's done so many things
trump, This man, if you look at what he's done, we went into a deal, the Korea, you know about the Korea deal Hillary Clinton's deal, along with Biden
trump, They promised 250,000 jobs, right 250,000 jobs
trump, And they were right
trump, Except all those jobs went to South Korea
trump, They didn't come to us
trump, 00, the polls close
trump, And they said, Donald Trump has won the state of Texas
trump, Simultaneously with the closing
trump, I'm now running in Texas against a man who's against oil, guns, and God
trump, How do you win Texas I said this, you could bring George Washington back as your Presidential candidate
trump, You could bring Abraham Lincoln
trump, Let's put him as the Vice Presidential candidate
trump, Run in Texas and other states, you couldn't win
trump, You couldn't win
trump, Now, they're not going to win
trump, We're going to win this
trump, And you're against the oil stuff too
trump, Because his whole thing on oil, no fracking, no this, no that
trump, New England has the highest energy costs in the United States
trump, And you know why Because Governor Cuomo will not let a pipeline go across the tip of New York State so that oil and gas, of which we have plenty, can come
trump, And do you know where you buy your energy from Russia
trump, Did you know that You have ships, much of it from Russia, because Governor Cuomo, New York won't allow a pipeline and they're desperate to have something happen in upper New York State
trump, And those are great people, but they've been treated very badly
trump, But they won't allow a pipeline
trump, By not allowing a pipeline, we're trying to do it through essentially eminent domain
trump, By not allowing a pipeline to go through upper New York State and create a lot of jobs for them, you have the highest energy prices in the United States by far
trump, Thank you New York
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you Governor Cuomo
trump, Biden voted for the Iraq war
trump, I was against the Iraq war
trump, He opposed a mission to take out Osama bin Laden
trump, He opposed the killing of Soleimani
trump, You remember that one He oversaw the rise of ISIS and he cheered the rise of China as a positive development for America and for the world
trump, That's not a positive development
trump, Before they went into the WTO, China was flat lined
trump, For years and years and decades, flat lined
trump, And then they got into the WTO and a lot of bad things happened
trump, First China's stole our jobs, plundered our intellectual property and unleashed the virus
trump, And now China is trying to just hug and kiss Joe Biden
trump, They want him so badly
trump, Look, if you like China, you should vote for Biden, that I can tell you
trump, How about his son You think the son, maybe there's a conflict How about his son Where's Hunter Where is Hunter Where is Hunter Does anybody know Where's Hunter He's in another country right now, probably, ripping off another country
trump, No, as soon as Biden became vice president, bad things happened with respect to a Hunter
trump, If that happened with respect to my family, I wouldn't be standing
trump, I guarantee you that
trump, I guarantee you that
trump, What a disgrace
trump, What a disgrace
trump, Ukraine
trump, And it's not just Ukraine and it's not just China
trump, But he goes into China, takes out 1
trump,5 billion to manage, and he knows nothing, and he wasn't even employed
trump, He got thrown out of the armed services
trump, So give me a break
trump, It's a disgrace, what's happening
trump, There's a double… There's a thing happening with the media like nobody's ever seen before
trump, These people right here
trump, Because if that happened to a Republican, in particular
trump, If any of that stuff happened to me, it would be brutal
trump, But it happened to him
trump, They don't want to talk about it
trump, And how about the questions asked by Anderson Cooper yesterday Anderson Cooper
trump, He's interviewed me a lot over the years and I always got along with him, but they were tough interviews
trump, Did you hear the questions And Biden kept looking down
trump, I think he was reading the answers off a teleprompter
trump, Right I think he was reading the answers off a teleprompter
trump, And that's happened before
trump, And how about David Muir of ABC He's a nice guy, right How soft were those questions How soft were those They don't ask me questions like that
trump, They got fire pouring out of their eyes
trump, No
trump, Mr
trump, Vice President, what do you think of this How was your breakfast, sir Did you enjoy it When I banned travel from China Biden, called it hysterical and xenophobic
trump, He even used, somewhere along the line, the word racist
trump, He always figures, they always want to get that word in there
trump, If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands of more Americans would have died
trump, But instead my decision, saved thousands and thousands of lives
trump, And then we banned Europe very early because I saw what was going on, really in Italy and Spain and France
trump, When the virus arrived, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II
trump, Mike Pence did a great job
trump, We produced more than 100,000 ventilators within weeks
trump, And not a single American who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator, not one
trump, You heard all about, and now we're producing ventilators
trump, Hard to produce
trump, Expensive, complex
trump, We're producing them now for the rest of the world
trump, 188 countries were affected by this
trump, We pioneered advances in treatment that have reduced the monthly rate
trump, And you look at this, the mortality rate has been reduced by 85 since April
trump, Think of that
trump, 85 since April
trump, Under Operation Warp Speed, three different vaccines are right now in final stage trials
trump, If you go back three years, that would have been something that would have been impossible to even discuss
trump, It would have taken years
trump, We will produce a vaccine this year and together we will defeat the virus
trump, It's already getting defeated
trump, And by the way, another big Democrat hoax
trump, Another big hoax
trump, I want football back
trump, I'm the one that's been saying
trump, Is that a correct statement I want football back
trump, These are young, strong guys
trump, They're not going to be affected by the virus
trump, If you look at it, it's generally older people
trump, Older people that have heart conditions, that have diabetes, that have problems
trump, These are big strong guys
trump, They'll be just fine
trump, But I want football back
trump, I've been calling for football to be back, including Big 10
trump, Big 10, get with it
trump, Open up your season, Big 10
trump, And the Dems don't want it back for political reasons
trump, But now their new line… This is like Russia, Russia, Russia
trump, All this crap they come up with
trump, Now their new line is they are trying to blame me and keep football shut down
trump, They want to keep it shut down
trump, And they're saying that President Trump shut it down
trump, I'm the one that wants it open
trump, So they're reversing it
trump, They're playing a big con game
trump, It's just a con game
trump, And that's what we're dealing with
trump, And we have to defeat them on November 3rd
trump, I want football back and Big 10 open
trump, And now the other day, Joe Biden came up with a plan to impose a blanket shutdown
trump, He'd be willing to do another blanket
trump, And we had to do it
trump, We blanket, we shut down
trump, We saved millions of lives
trump, Instead of the number we have today, 175,000, we could have had 2 million today instead
trump, It would have been unacceptable, unsustainable
trump, Unsustainable
trump, We did everything right
trump, We did it right
trump, We closed it down
trump, We stopped China
trump, We stopped Europe
trump, Now we're opening it up and we're opening it up to record numbers, despite the fact that the Democrats are keeping their states shut down and hurting people that live in those states, shut down as long as possible
trump, But now Biden wants to do another blanket shutdown, possibly, that would decimate the economy and cause suicides, drug overdoses, alcohol abuse, heart attacks, joblessness
trump, You'd have jobs, all of the problems that it causes
trump, Because it's not just a one sided equation
trump, A shut down causes big problems also
trump, And at this point, when the economy is roaring back
trump, We had record job numbers this last quarter, over 9 million jobs
trump, We're going to throw that all out We have a market… You know, your stock market
trump, Who has 401k's here Your 401k's and your stocks, when you have stocks, would be obliterated
trump, And right now, we have just, on two of your markets, as you know, SP and NASDAQ, you're at new records
trump, And you're about to hit another new record
trump, Think of it
trump, Who would have thought the stock market And hopefully we're at the end of this horrible China virus
trump, Came from China
trump, They should have stopped it and they did
trump, But who would have thought, just who would have thought that the stock market is at record levels right now Record levels
trump, And everything else is going to follow
trump, Before the virus, we created an economic miracle and now we're doing it again
trump, We did the Paycheck Protection Program where we saved more than 200,000 jobs in New Hampshire alone
trump, 200,000, right Over the past three months, we've gained so many different, if you look at retail numbers
trump, Take a look at our retail numbers
trump, They're literally at records
trump, Look at some of the numbers be announced by companies
trump, They're at records
trump, Can you imagine giving that all up and starting again It's not acceptable
trump, If I'm reelected, we will create 10 million jobs over the next 10 months, and we'll do that easily
trump, The Biden agenda, with big tax increases and big regulation increases, would immediately kill everything
trump, You will go into a depression
trump, And I'm very good at predicting this
trump, You will go into a depression the likes of which this country has not seen since 1929, and who knows, maybe worse than that
trump, They are playing a suicide mission
trump, … be worse than that
trump, They are playing a suicide mission if they want to raise your taxes
trump, They want to raise your taxes by 4 trillion
trump, And that's going to be almost everybody
trump, They're saying for the rich
trump, No, not for the rich
trump, They're going to be raising everybody's taxes almost
trump, Joe Biden is running on the most extreme far left platform of any nominee in American history and of our foreign adversaries, we're devising a plan to destroy the United States from within
trump, All they have to look is at the Biden Harris
trump, How about her Is she a beauty What a beauty that is
trump, They pick a woman who starts off… She starts off sort of strong
trump, She's one of the favorites
trump, Within a period of a few months, she goes down, down 15, 12, 11, nine, eight, five, three, two
trump, Then she goes, I'm going to leave because I've decided that I want to leave
trump, I want to leave
trump, She left because she wouldn't have gotten any votes
trump, She was terrible
trump, This would be your president possibly
trump, I don't think so
trump, I don't think so
trump, I want to see the first woman president also, but I don't want to see a woman president get into that position the way she do it and she's not competent
trump, She's not competent
trump, They're all saying we want Ivanka
trump, I don't blame them
trump, They want to eliminate America's borders in the middle of a pandemic, suspend all deportations, restore catch and release, and expand horrible, dangerous, disgusting sanctuary cities
trump, They want to give illegal aliens government healthcare and taxpayer funded lawyers
trump, That's what we need is more lawyers
trump, Let's get some more lawyers into the act
trump, They want to end national security travel bands from jihadist nations, very dangerous, and increase refugee admissions by 700
trump, This is in the Bernie Sanders, crazy Bernie, you know crazy Bernie
trump, A lot of his people are going to vote for me just like they did last time
trump, You know why Because of trade
trump, Because I agree with Bernie Sanders, but my trade policies are much tougher than his and I'm able to do it
trump, All you have to do is how is China doing last year with my trade policy Not too well
trump, And we had the best year we've ever had
trump, We're going to get a lot of Bernie Sanders voters because they like my attitude on trade
trump, They really like it because I've been telling people for years our country is being ripped off by China and many other countries, including, I hate to say it, our allies
trump, Our allies have been ripping us big
trump, And you heard me say last night, NATO, I got 130 billion from them first time going up to 400 billion a year from NATO countries, by saying, You got to do it
trump, You got to do it
trump, And general Secretary Stoltenberg said it can't be done
trump, He could not believe it
trump, He's actually my biggest fan and nobody ever calls him for a quote
trump, Call him sometime
trump, They want to abolish cash bail and cut funding for law enforcement
trump, They want to end… We want to increase law enforcement, not cut law enforcement
trump, And by the way, Pat Lynch is a great guy, New York, New York
trump, Really great, New York's finest, right Their rights have been taken away from them
trump, Literally they're not allowed to do their job, but Pay Lynch, he said the first time in history that they know of New York's finest have endorsed a candidate
trump, The candidate is Donald Trump
trump, First time they've done it
trump, All over the country, the sheriffs of Florida, all of Texas, all over the country, Ohio, law enforcement's endorsing Trump
trump, I cannot imagine them getting any law enforcement endorsements
trump, If they do, please let me know and we'll have a little discussion
trump, We'll ask why did that happen They want to end school choice and ban charter schools
trump, They want to abolish American energy, including all of the things I said before
trump, And add to that coal and add to that shale
trump, A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, a bright future, the American dream for all Americans
trump, There is no limit to what we can achieve with four more years
trump, So in conclusion, I have to say this
trump, Over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing super power of the world that's happening already
trump, We will end our reliance on China once and for all
trump, We'll do it here
trump, Like we used to do in the good old days before we owed trillions of dollars
trump, We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, surge federal prosecutors into high crime communities and neighborhoods and ban sanctuary cities
trump, We will kill our terrorist's enemies as we've been doing while keeping America out of the endless foreign Wars
trump, I go to Dover and I greet these incredible families of soldiers that have been so sadly killed
trump, So sadly killed
trump, It's such a shame
trump, I go to the hospital, I go to Walter Reed Medical Center
trump, It's incredible
trump, The doctors are so talented
trump, I see what they can do, but soldiers so badly hurt
trump, And they're really acting as police
trump, They're acting as police
trump, Now, we're very low in Afghanistan now in terms of numbers of troops
trump, We're getting out
trump, We'll be getting out soon
trump, We're very low in Iraq
trump, We're very low in Syria, except we kept the oil
trump, We left some behind for the oil
trump, If you don't mind, we kept the oil
trump, We should have kept the oil in Iraq like I've been saying
trump, We'll appoint prosecutors, judges, and justices who believe in enforcing the law, not their own political agenda, which is what we have in many cases right now
trump, The next president will be in my opinion, responsible for two, three, four, and maybe, maybe even five US Supreme Court Justices
trump, You better vote for me, you better vote for me or you're going to have the greatest depression you've ever seen
trump, We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms
trump, Second amendment
trump, We will surprise medical billing require, it's already done
trump, I signed it
trump, Nobody can believe I did it
trump, Price transparency
trump, You know what that is Do you know how big that is Where you're able to actually negotiate with hospitals, see their prices, compare it
trump, You know who likes it Good hospitals and good doctors
trump, Other people don't like it
trump, It's the biggest thing and nobody even talks about it, but I've already put it into effect
trump, The bad news is it goes into effect on January 1st
trump, You better make sure you elect me so I get credit for it
trump, Otherwise, could you imagine if sleepy Joe got in and medical prices and drug prices and everything had dropped, but he said, I wonder what happened And I did it all
trump, I'll be so angry at New Hampshire
trump, I'll never speak to you again
trump, Now, all these things, what we're doing with drugs, we instituted a favored nations laws
trump, We instituted favored nations
trump, That's going to drop your prices 50, 60, 70
trump, And I'm the only president in 51 years, last year, drug prices went down a little, not much, but they went down the first time in 51 years
trump, Favored nations could drop at 50, 60, or 70
trump, On top of that, I instituted rebates where the rebates go toward price reductions and back to the customer instead of to a middleman
trump, So we will protect Medicare and we will protect Social Security and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions
trump, America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to plant its beautiful American flag
trump, Do we love our American flag Or Mars
trump, Above all, we will teach our children to love our country, to honor our history and be inspired by the words of the New Hampshire state motto
trump, Have you ever heard of these words Live free or die
trump, Live free or die
trump, Vote for those people
trump, And you do, you have a great governor
trump, Vote for your people, vote for your governor
trump, You have a great governor
trump, From Portsmouth to Dixville from Concord to Keene
trump, I know a friend from Keene
trump, Great guy
trump, I had a friend from Keene a long time
trump, Keene, New Hampshire
trump, And Merrimack to Manchester, we will fight for every job, every family and every neighborhood
trump, We will fight for every vote
trump, We have to win
trump, We have no choice
trump, Can I be honest with you We're working hard
trump, We're all working
trump, I don't have to do this
trump, I could get off that beautiful plane that used to be black and white with a red stripe
trump, That was mine
trump, But that's Air Force one
trump, I get off that beautiful plane
trump, I could come up and say, Ladies and gentlemen of New Hampshire, you have no choice
trump, You have to vote for me because if you don't, you'll be put in radical lefties
trump, You'll have a depression
trump, Your stocks will be worthless
trump, Your 401ks will be gone
trump, There'll be crime all over your streets
trump, So I'm not going to work at all
trump, I'm leaving now, but you have to vote for me because you have no choice
trump, Right I could say it
trump, Right Right We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trail, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads
trump, Won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism and made America the greatest nation in the history of the world and we are making it greater
trump, We will be greater than ever before
trump, Incredible citizens like you, the people of New Hampshire, helped build this country
trump, And together we are taking back our country
trump, We are not going to let the radical left socialists or communists take our country
trump, We're not going to let it
trump, We're returning power to you the American people
trump, With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working
trump, We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning
trump, We are one movement, one people, one family, and one nation under God
trump, And we don't take the beautiful word God out of our Pledge of Allegiance, do we They did it twice
trump, They it twice
trump, Then they say, Well, we didn't mean that
trump, Oh, I see
trump, I was listening once they said, That's right
trump, You don't know what it is, what happened What happened They did it on purpose
trump, They did it twice
trump, That's where they're coming from
trump, You can be fools and you can be fooled, but that's where they're coming from
trump, So don't be surprised, but they're not going to get there
trump, We're not going to let it happen
trump, We're not going to let our country be destroyed by a bunch of nut jobs
trump, America will soon be thriving like never before and together with the people of New Hampshire that have meant so much to me, and I brought down opioid and I brought down drug problems for you by 19 and nobody even talks about it
trump, 19
trump, I talk about New Hampshire a lot because you had one of the proportionally worst problems of any country, of any state in this incredible country
trump, You had one of the worst problems of any of the states
trump, And I talk about you a lot
trump, It was incredible
trump, And you still have
trump, But we brought it down 19 and people are absolutely shocked
trump, If it weren't for the China plague, the number would be 25 or 30
trump, That really hurt us because people sort of went back to some old ways because they don't want to be shut down any longer
trump, Joe, don't you understand that They don't want to be shut down
trump, So I worked very hard on that for this state and for other states, but this was a state that was so severely impacted with the drug problem
trump, That wall is stopping them and it's stopping them like never before
trump, It's stopping them like never before
trump, I want to thank New Hampshire for all you've done for me
trump, I want to thank New Hampshire
trump, You were my first victory, as I said, but you are going to lead a nation to the most important victory and the most important election that we've ever had
trump, We will make America wealthy again
trump, We will make America strong again
trump, We will make America proud again
trump, We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you
trump,
trump,Hello, Manchester, and I am thrilled to be in the great state of New Hampshire with thousands of hardworking patriots who believe in God, family, and country
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you
trump, And I'll tell you what — we have more in this arena, and I hate to say this to you… we have more than this outside of the arena trying to get in
trump, So if you'd like to give up your seat or where you're standing… Sorry we couldn't get you seats, but if you want to give it up, let them come in, you go out
trump, Does anybody want to make that deal I don't think so
trump, But we have more in this arena and outside of this arena than all of the other candidates, meaning the Democrats, put together and multiplied times fave
trump, And the fake news, these guys will never report that
trump, They'll never report it
trump, They don't even like showing the crowd
trump, They always show my face
trump, They never show the crowd
trump, But you know what The people can hear the crowd
trump, The people can hear the crowd
trump, They know
trump, That is not the sound of 200 people
trump, One of their prime candidates today, they worked a big deal
trump, They had exactly 104 people, and the fake news said, It was a nice crowd
trump, Very nice
trump, If I had one empty seat here, one empty seat in this massive arena, they'd say, He didn't sell out
trump, But you know what We have never had an empty seat from the day your future first lady and I came down the escalator
trump, Never, not one time
trump, And we have the biggest arenas in the country
trump, With your help on November 3rd we are going to defeat the radical socialist Democrats
trump, We are going to win New Hampshire in a landslide
trump, This is a truly incredible time for America
trump, We have the best economy we've ever had, the most prosperity
trump, We have got the most prosperity we've ever had
trump, By the way, we're going to keep it that way, too, if it's okay, who was mumbling, very distracting, very distracting
trump, It's true
trump, You know, it was very distracting
trump, I'm speaking and a woman is mumbling terribly behind me, angry
trump, There was a little anger back there
trump, We're the ones that should be angry, not them
trump, We're the ones that should be angry, but we proudly declared that we are in the midst of the great American comeback
trump, Our country is stronger today than ever before
trump, And the day after my address, our good Republicans in the United States Senate voted to reject the outrageous partisan impeachment hoax and to issue a full, complete, and absolute, total acquittal
trump, And it ,wasn't even close and I want to thank our Republican senators and our Republican House members
trump, They were tremendous
trump, In the House, we won 196 to nothing and then we got three Democrats
trump, And in the Senate, other than Romney, we got 52 to nothing, 52 to nothing
trump, That's something, and in one case we got 53 to nothing, but I don't even count that to be honest
trump, The radical left's pathetic partisan crusade has completely failed and utterly backfired with 18 votes… think of that… 18 votes to spare, with a lot of votes to spare
trump, And also very importantly, as of today, I… we, because it's not we
trump, It's not I
trump, It's we
trump, We're all in this together
trump, We have the highest poll numbers that we have ever had
trump, Thank you, Nancy, very much
trump, Thank you
trump, While the extreme left has been wasting America's time with this vile hoax, we've been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, enacting fair trade deals, securing our borders, and lifting up citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed
trump, From our rural communities to our cities, we are expanding the blessings of America to all of our citizens
trump, We added another 225,000 new jobs last month alone
trump, Amazing
trump, And I listened
trump, I watched
trump, I had all these experts
trump, They were saying, Yes, I think 60,000
trump, Another one said 101,000
trump, Another one said 125
trump, Another one was 118
trump, And then the number came out, 225,000
trump, Pretty good
trump, Pretty good
trump, We have destroyed the ISIS caliphate
trump, We killed the founder and leader of ISIS
trump, Al-Baghdadi is dead
trump, Al-Baghdadi is dead, and we just took out the world's top terrorist, Qasem Soleimani, ending his evil reign of terror forever
trump, The fact is, America is respected again
trump, It's been a long time
trump, But as we keep on winning, Washington democrats keep on losing their minds
trump, They're crazy
trump, That's why millions of registered Democrat voters are leaving their party to join our movement
trump, They're joining our great Republican party
trump, Now, I can't tell you what's happening tomorrow because you know you have some pretty strange election laws here, right Remember last time We won the primary tremendously
trump, We should have won the election, but they had buses being shipped up from Massachusetts, hundreds and hundreds of buses
trump, And it was very, very close even though they did, but this year we have a great governor, Governor Sununu
trump, Great governor, Chris
trump, And now you get prosecuted if you do what they did, so it should be a lot different
trump, But we have done great
trump, This has been an incredible state for us
trump, It's a state where the people are great, just great people
trump, And we hear that there could be because you have crossovers in primaries, don't you So I hear a lot of Republicans tomorrow will vote for the weakest candidate possible of the Democrats
trump, Does that make sense You people wouldn't do that
trump, My only problem is I'm trying to figure out who is their weakest candidate I think they're all weak if you want to know the truth
trump, We proudly welcome and embrace voters of all parties and political persuasions who want to join our mission
trump, A very simple mission, remember Make America great again
trump, And then after we make it great again, which we already have… We've had 141 days where the stock markets have reached their all-time historical high
trump, 141, think about it
trump, Out of three years, 141
trump, And to me, I view it differently
trump, Well, look at your 401ks
trump, I mean, who is doing well with their 401k Up 90
trump, Up 104
trump, Is there anybody doing badly with the 401k I'd like to not talk to that person
trump, Does anybody have a 401k where they're doing badly, please Oh, don't put up your hand
trump, I don't believe it
trump, Nah, the 401ks, they're up 90, 95
trump, I always tell this story
trump, People come up to me
trump, They say, I want to thank you
trump, My wife thinks I'm a total loser, sir
trump, She thinks I am the worst person with money, with financial
trump, She thinks I'm just horrible
trump, In the last three years, I'm up 94, sir
trump, She thinks I'm a total genius when it comes to finance
trump, She loves me again
trump, She didn't love me before, sir
trump, She loves me again
trump, That tells you something about money, doesn't it The first step to victory in November is tomorrow
trump, Go send a message that Republicans… And you can vote for the weakest candidate if you want
trump, Don't worry about it
trump, I don't really think we actually have a candidate against us… that Republicans are energized, that we're united, and that nine months from now we are going to take back the House of Representatives
trump, We are going to hold the Senate and we are going to keep the White House
trump, You know, they always talk about the Democrats
trump, They have enthusiasm, right We have so much more enthusiasm than them
trump, It's not even close
trump, They're all fighting each other
trump, They're all going after each other
trump, You got them all over the place
trump, They don't know what the hell they're doing
trump, They don't know what they're doing
trump, They can't even count their votes
trump, We're thrilled to be joined tonight by many great leaders from across this state and this country, great national leaders
trump, I want to thank our tremendous Vice President, Mike Pence, who spoke earlier this evening
trump, And also with us, our warrior senators, the two people that wanted to be here
trump, They're going to be here tomorrow
trump, They're going to be here to get out the vote
trump, I don't think we have to worry too much about it, but that's okay… And very highly respected, Senators Lindsey Graham and Rand Paul
trump, Great guys
trump, Warriors, they're warriors
trump, Hey, Lindsay and Rand
trump, That's not bad
trump, Can you imagine if you actually came from New Hampshire what it would be Right That's not bad, but they have been great
trump, All they do is they looked at everybody for the last couple of months and they said, Read the transcripts please
trump, Read the transcripts
trump, But I want to thank you both very much

trump, He got shot and he got up
trump, He was going to die that night
trump, I tell this story all the time
trump, His wife, she was crying so much
trump, When he finally did awake, I said, Well, one thing I learned, your wife loves you
trump, Why do you say that Because she was devastated
trump, I know many wives that don't get too upset
trump, His wife was devastated
trump, His family was devastated
trump, The doctor told me he didn't have a good chance, but he's tough as hell and he's a really terrific friend

trump, I retweeted you all over the place
trump, And all together we're building the world's most prosperous economy and the most inclusive society anywhere in the world
trump, It's a great thing
trump, It's a great thing
trump, Since my election, America's gained 7 million new jobs
trump, The unemployment rate has hit the lowest rate in half a century
trump, The average unemployment rate under my administration is lower than any previous administration in the history of our country
trump, You believe that one That's pretty amazing
trump, That's pretty amazing
trump, The unemployment rate among African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans has reached record lows, all time, never been lower than what it is now
trump, And by the way, our poll numbers with African Americans, with Hispanic Americans, with Asian Americans, the other side is getting a little nervous because they are like rocket ships
trump, They're going up
trump, African American youth unemployment is so important
trump, It was a horrible number a few years ago
trump, You remember, it was a really terrible thing was happening
trump, It's just reached the lowest time in the history, lowest, the best number in the history of our country
trump, And African American poverty numbers have hit the lowest rate ever recorded
trump, Wages for African American workers have increased by 2,400 per year, also a record
trump, And you know this
trump, For decades, the Democrat party has betrayed African Americans
trump, They betrayed us all
trump, They betrayed all of us
trump, But we're delivering for African Americans
trump, We're delivering for Asian Americans and Hispanic Americans like nobody has ever done
trump, We are fighting for great jobs, great schools, great healthcare, and a truly great future for our country and for them
trump, We are the party of equal opportunity for all Americans
trump, Thank you
trump, To support working families, we've reduced the cost of childcare, expanded paid leave, and given 40 million American families an average of 2,200 more in their pockets thanks to the Republican child tax credit
trump, Who would have thought that We have cut more job killing regulations than any… You know this one
trump, So you go back four years, eight years
trump, In one case, longer than eight years
trump, We've cut more job killing regulations than any other administration in the history of our country, and we're not finished
trump, We've ended the war on American energy
trump, They want to take our energy away
trump, They want to take our wealth away
trump, They want to give us wind
trump, Wind
trump, If it blows, wonderful
trump, If it doesn't blow, you got problems
trump, Wind
trump, They want to destroy our countrysides, put windmills all over them
trump, Watch your house go down in value
trump, You ever see what happens They build a windmill within distance of your house
trump, You could forget about your house
trump, You could just say, well, that was the end of that investment
trump, You want to see a bird graveyard, go to the bottom of a windmill
trump, Take a look
trump, It's a graveyard for birds
trump, They kill all the birds
trump, Lowering utility bills and reducing prices at the pump, that's what we're doing
trump, We are reversing decades of calamitous trade policies, Washington politicians… You know this
trump, They shuttered New Hampshire factories
trump, You were one of the worst examples ever
trump, NAFTA, what NAFTA to your communities, I mean to your state, is incredible
trump, Shattered your communities and sacrifice your jobs on the altar of globalism
trump, We can forget globalism
trump, We want to take care of our country
trump, New Hampshire alone lost one in four manufacturing jobs following that twin disaster of NAFTA and China's entrance into the WTO, the World Trade Organization, one of the truly bad deals ever made in the history of our country
trump, For decades, politicians campaigned across this state promising to replace NAFTA
trump, They lied
trump, They never did it
trump, They never even tried to do it
trump, They wouldn't have been able to anyway
trump, It wasn't easy, I will tell you that
trump, But then they got elected and they did absolutely nothing
trump, But I'm not like those other politicians
trump, I keep my promises
trump, We took care of it
trump, We took care of it
trump, You saw last month being bye-bye
trump, I say Donald J
trump, Trump, bye-bye NAFTA
trump, We ended the NAFTA catastrophe and I signed the brand new US Mexico Canada Agreement into law
trump, That's going to be great for our manufacturers, our farmers
trump, Great for everybody
trump, Great for our workers
trump, The USMCA will bring jobs back to New Hampshire right where they belong
trump, They should have never left in the first place
trump, Probably the number one reason I ran for office
trump, I'm one for one
trump, I have friends
trump, Some of these great senators, look at Lindsey over there and look at Rand
trump, These great senators
trump, Sure, I've run five times and I've won three
trump, And other senators said Sir, I've won seven times, sir
trump, Southern senator
trump, I won seven times, sir, and I've won five of those damn contests
trump, I said, Senator, I ran once and I won just once
trump, And we're going to run twice and that's going to be it
trump, Although they think we're going to run much more than that, you know that, right It scares the hell out of the fake news, I will tell you
trump, They can't take a joke
trump, I also took the strongest ever action to confront China's massive theft of American jobs, and our strategy worked
trump, Massive tariff and tariff money is pouring in and has poured in, poured in by the billions and billions
trump, We never took in 25 cents from China
trump, They ripped us so much you wouldn't believe it
trump, Now they respect us again
trump, Last month we signed a groundbreaking trade agreement with China that will defeat so many of our opponents
trump, The money that's pouring in, people don't even believe it
trump, And by the way, the virus, they're working hard
trump, Looks like by April, in theory when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away
trump, I hope that's true, but we're doing great in our country
trump, China, I spoke with president Xi and they're working very, very hard and I think it's going to all work out fine
trump, Rough stuff, I tell you
trump, Rough, rough stuff, but I think it's going to work out good
trump, We only have 11 cases and they're all getting better
trump, But our trade agreement with China will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, and substantially boost exports of American made goods
trump, Is that nice After years of building up other countries, we are finally rebuilding our country
trump, On no issue of Washington Democrats more thoroughly sold out the American people than a thing called immigration, right Before I came into office, the far left's policy of open borders allowed deadly drugs to flow freely into our country and that's what they want
trump, I see them campaigning right down the street
trump, It's really boring to watch, but I try and watch
trump, No, I have an obligation to watch really boring stuff
trump, But they want open borders
trump, They want thousands and thousands of people to pour into our country, many of whom are not exactly what we're looking for, okay I mean murderers, rapists, and some other things
trump, They're going to be poisoning our children with drugs, including right here in New Hampshire, and you have one of the drug problems in the country
trump, And we brought it down 18 but we have to do better
trump, 18
trump, Washington Democrats put the needs of illegal immigrants before the wellbeing of American citizens
trump, They want to let anyone into our country from all around the world
trump, Just come on in, folks, we're going to give you free healthcare
trump, We're going to give you free education
trump, We're going to give you more than our vets are getting
trump, Every family will get a free Rolls Royce
trump, You know I said that, Matt
trump, I said that to them and some of the fake news picked it up and they said, President Trump said every family coming into our country illegally gets a brand new free Rolls Royce
trump, He lied
trump, He lied
trump, He lied
trump, They gave me a Pinocchio
trump, They don't get it, Matt, do they, Matt Actually they get it better than we understand
trump, They get it very well
trump, They get it
trump, They know what's happening
trump, And the wall is being built
trump, I will tell you the wall is being built
trump, And you know they went after us on everybody knows the wall is going up
trump, So what's happening You do know who's paying for the wall, don't you Right
trump, Redemption from illegal aliens that are coming
trump, The redemption money is paying for the wall
trump, They're so sad to hear that because it's okay, finally, they go
trump, You have to understand an entire party is fighting
trump, They'll give me anything I want
trump, Our military would rebuilt it
trump, 2
trump,2, it's really 2
trump,5 trillion over a period of three years
trump, They give me anything but not 25 cents for the wall
trump, They said, We like drones
trump, Well, drones don't keep people out
trump, Drones are wonderful
trump, They fly around, take pictures
trump, We're going to give you a drone
trump, No good
trump, So we now have built over 100 miles of wall
trump, And when we have that wall built, you have to see what happens to the illegal aliens that don't come in
trump, I say they can't come in
trump, They don't come in
trump, So we up to over a hundred, substantially more than a hundred miles of wall, and we'll have close to 500 miles of wall in the very near future
trump, And by the way, you have to see
trump, You wouldn't believe it
trump, You have to see what happens when that wall goes up
trump, You have to see the numbers change like magic
trump, They change like magic
trump, You ever hear the thing with all the modern technology, all of the new computers, the new genius, the new everything, cyber this, cyber that, two things never change, right A wheel and a wall
trump, Right A wheel and a wall
trump, They're going to have a lot of brilliant people working over the years
trump, They're never going to replace the wheel and they're never going to replace the wall, and it's a high wall
trump, Illegal immigrants coming in, coming into our country illegally, very few of them are getting in right now
trump, Mexico has been terrific
trump, We have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our border and the numbers went down 87 from this year and this time last year
trump, And for the amount of money Washington Democrats want to spend supporting illegal immigrants, we could rebuild the cities in America
trump, We could rebuild our cities
trump, But I have something, because people were screaming to me for the last four or five rallies, read the snake
trump, The snake
trump, Does anybody know what I'm talking about She knows
trump, She's been standing outside for four days, no wonder
trump, And you look good, I'll tell you what
trump, Four days outside in the rain and snow
trump, Look at these front row people
trump, These are warriors
trump, They're warriors too, like my congressmen and senators
trump, I made minor changes
trump, They mentioned illegal immigration
trump, This is about immigration
trump, This was a song from the 1950s, Al Green
trump, And they mentioned little changes to it, that's okay
trump, But they mentioned illegal immigration, right And I used to do this a lot and people couldn't get enough of it, to be honest with you
trump, And I haven't done it for a while, and I thought I'd do it tonight because you're on the eve of giving us an opponent and all of these people want open borders
trump, They want open borders, and we don't want open borders
trump, We want very strong closed borders
trump, And we want people to come into our country, but they want to come in through merit and we want them to come in legally, right Right Through merit and legally
trump, Right So we'll do this quickly
trump, This is illegal immigration
trump, It's called… Oh, listen to how quiet it is
trump, Listen to how quiet
trump, Now watch how quiet it gets
trump, Gets so quiet
trump, But this is all about… I love you too
trump, That was a guy that said that, but I love him too
trump, I love everybody
trump, Ready So important
trump, Illegal immigration
trump, On our way to work one morning down the path along the lake, a tender hearted woman saw a poor half frozen snake
trump, His pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew
trump, Poor thing, she cried, I'll take you in and I'll take care of you
trump, Take me in, oh tender woman, take me in for heaven's sake
trump, Take me in, oh tender woman, sighed the vicious snake
trump, She wrapped him up all cozy in a comforter of silk and laid him by her fireside with some honey and some milk
trump, She hurried home from work that night and as soon as she arrived, she found that pretty snake she'd taken in had been fully, fully revived
trump, Take me in, oh tender woman, take me in for heaven sake
trump, Take me in, oh tender woman, sighed that vicious snake
trump, She clutched him to her bosom
trump, You're so beautiful, she cried
trump, But if I hadn't brought you in by now, you truly would have died
trump, She stroked his pretty skin again and kissed him and held him tight
trump, But instead of saying thank you, the snake gave her a vicious bite
trump, Take me in, oh tender woman, take me in for heaven's sake
trump, Take me in, oh tender woman, sighed the vicious snake
trump, I saved you, cried the woman, and you've bitten me, but why You know your bite is poisonous and now I'm going to die
trump, Shut up, silly woman, said the reptile with a grin
trump, You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in
trump, Got to come in legally and through merit
trump, Under my administration we're fully taking care of our own citizens first, including millions of African American and Hispanic Americans who are entitled to a government that protects their families and their communities
trump, In this region of the country alone last year, ICE officers… We love our ICE officers
trump, The Democrats don't like them
trump, The Democrats don't like them
trump, ICE officers are the toughest human beings, and they love the country as much as anybody in this room
trump, Last year alone they … in this room
trump, Last year alone, they arrested over 2,000 criminal aliens charged or convicted of dangerous offenses including robbery, rape, and murder
trump, Over 2,000 accused of murder, yet left wing politicians support sanctuary cities that release criminal aliens directly into the American community
trump, One of guests at the State of the Union was American citizen, Jody Jones
trump, I introduced him that night
trump, His beloved brother, Rocky, was murdered by a criminal alien in California, shot him eight times at close range, wouldn't stop
trump, Rocky's killer had been previously arrested many, many times, but under California's totally insane and outrageous sanctuary law, authorities were ordered to set him free
trump, Tragically, left wing politicians in New Hampshire tried to replicate California's disastrous policies
trump, Last year, the Democrat controlled New Hampshire house blocked legislation that would have banned sanctuary cities in your state
trump, And by the way, you have a great governor, Chris Sununu
trump, He's on top of it
trump, He's on top of it
trump, And his father is a great guy
trump, His father didn't like me too much a few years ago
trump, Once I won, I'm telling you, he was so good
trump, He was as good
trump, He fought like hell for us, all of us
trump, It's a great family, and Chris is doing a fantastic job
trump, If you want to shut down sanctuary cities, if you want to protect your family and your loved ones, you must vote Republican in 2020, November
trump, And thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, we have reduced illegal border crossings eight straight months in a row
trump, Illegal crossings are down now at record numbers and we've ended catch and release
trump, You know what catch and release is You catch an illegal alien by law
trump, You then take his name and address
trump, They don't have addresses
trump, What's your address What They don't have addresses
trump, They come into the country, they don't have addresses
trump, So you take his name and then you have to release him into the country and you say, We'll see you in four years for your court case
trump, We never see them
trump, They never come back
trump, We have seized record amounts of drugs
trump, We have deported record numbers of gang members, MS-13 by the thousands
trump, And we have done more to secure the border of our country than any administration in history
trump, … Does anybody know who won Iowa I don't know
trump, Maybe Rander, Lindsey
trump, Grant, does anybody know who won Lindsey, you're a total pro
trump, Nobody knows
trump, He said nobody
trump, Flip a coin
trump, Flip a coin
trump, Flip a coin
trump, They're going to run your health care
trump, Unbelievable
trump, Nobody knows who won
trump, Actually, I think they're trying to take it away from Bernie again
trump, I think Bernie came in second
trump, Can you believe it They're doing it to you again, Bernie
trump, They're doing it to you again
trump, We're saving your healthcare while these socialist Democrats are trying to take away your healthcare
trump, We are making healthcare better and much, much cheaper
trump, You've seen what we did
trump, We are protecting people with preexisting conditions and we always will
trump, The Republican party always will
trump, Always will
trump, And we got rid of the most unpopular thing in the healthcare world, the individual mandate
trump, We had to pay a fortune not to have pay a fortune
trump, You paid a fortune not to pay a fortune for bad healthcare
trump, And we got rid of it, saved a lot of money for a lot of people
trump, And we're stopping surprise medical bills and making everything transparent
trump, That's bigger than healthcare transparency and that'll go unfortunately into effect right around the election time
trump, It would be nice if we could get it earlier, but it's all done
trump, It's all signed
trump, Because when providers are required to show you what the prices are, those prices are going to come tumbling down
trump, Blood tests as an example, one hospital has them for 53
trump, Another hospital, the same test, 2,415
trump, Same exact test
trump, And it may even be better, who knows We're approving more generic drugs than ever before at any time in the history of our country
trump, That's bringing prices down
trump, We are defending your right to keep the doctor and to keep your plan
trump, Remember President Obama, you could keep your plan
trump, You could keep 28 times
trump, You can keep your doctor
trump, That didn't turn out very good
trump, We should impeach him for that
trump, Why aren't we impeaching him 28 times, you can keep your doctor
trump, We should impeach President Obama
trump, Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption
trump, The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and the late great Abraham Lincoln, right Abraham Lincoln
trump, Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background, every community and every walk of life
trump, We are the party of boundless optimism, excitement, energy, and enthusiasm
trump, We love people
trump, We are asking all Americans to join our incredible movement
trump, People are signing up left and right
trump, But if you want to vote for a weak candidate tomorrow, go ahead
trump, Pick one
trump, Pick the weakest one you think, I don't know who it is
trump, We are a big party with big ideas for the future
trump, Very big
trump, We become a big party and an open-minded party and we're the party that people like
trump, We're the hot party and we're the party with all the enthusiasm
trump, We are fighting for school choice because no parent should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school
trump, Right We pass criminal justice reform to give former prisoners a second chance at life
trump, Most incredible thing that's happened
trump, Prisoners never really had a shot
trump, They'd get out, they couldn't get a job no matter what they did, and they'd go back
trump, They'd go back to their ways
trump, I mean, in many cases I guess they had no choice
trump, It was a disaster
trump, Now they're getting out and because our economy is so good and because of what we've done with criminal justice reform and other things like opportunities, zones, et cetera, they're getting jobs and employers are loving them
trump, They're doing great
trump, They're doing great
trump, They are doing great first time ever
trump, They're not going back
trump, To uphold the rule of law, we have confirmed 191 federal judges who will interpret the Constitution as written
trump, And as you know, we've also confirmed two great new Supreme Court justices
trump, Thank you very much
trump, Thank you, Grant
trump, Thank you, Lindsey
trump, Thank you
trump, We have invested 2
trump,2 trillion to rebuild the United States military, as I said, and I love saying it because we are funding for New Hampshire, the New Hampshire Army National Guard readiness centers just a few miles from here in Pembroke and in Concord
trump, Concord, I love Concord
trump, I love Concord
trump, Oh, Concord
trump, You know how famous Concord is Concord
trump, That's the same Concord that we read about all the time, right Concord
trump, I love Concord
trump, I recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem
trump, And we recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, been trying to do that for 52 years
trump, We got it done
trump, And for years you watched as your politicians … They really, I mean, they went out, I'd like to apologize for the behavior of the United States
trump, No, no
trump, We don't know we don't apologize anymore
trump, We don't apologize
trump, Now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the great people of New Hampshire
trump, Thank you
trump, At stake in our present battle is to survival actually of our nation
trump, If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for to secure, then we must devote everything we have toward victory November 3rd, 2020
trump, Only this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp once and for all
trump, And I will tell you, that swamp is much worse than I thought when I was out here innocently campaigning
trump, Let's drain the swamp
trump, That swamp is a lot worse than anybody ever thought
trump, That swamp is that dirty swamp
trump, That's a dirty swamp
trump, You have some really evil, dirty, horrible people
trump, Like to say nice, everyone's nice
trump, They're not good
trump, They're not good people
trump, But we're draining that sucker slowly but surely
trump, With your help, we will lift millions of more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity
trump, Together, we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, sane, and lawful system of immigration
trump, We will continue to enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase Made in the USA
trump, We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America in less than 10 years
trump, How about that It'll be done
trump, We will land the first woman in the moon and become the first nation in the world to plant its flag on Mars
trump, We're very advanced
trump, All made in the USA
trump, We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to- … keep and bear arms
trump, We're going to protect your Second Amendments
trump, By the way, they're going to take away everything
trump, They're going to take away your wealth
trump, They're going to take away your guns
trump, They're going to take away everything
trump, Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America
trump, We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States
trump, We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement
trump, We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life
trump, We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way
trump, We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag
trump, We live by the words of our national motto, In God we trust
trump, From Nashua to Dixville, from Portsmouth to Plymouth, from Concord to Claremont, and from Meredith to right here in Manchester, we stand on the shoulders of red-blooded American Patriots who poured out their heart, sweat, and soul to secure our liberty and defend our freedom
trump, New Hampshire was founded by tough frontier men and strong, powerful pioneer women who defied the dangers and raised their children to embrace the eternal motto, Live free or die
trump, I love that motto
trump, Live free or die
trump, These courageous Americans tamed the wilderness, braved the elements, changed the hills, fought the battles, and helped make this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the Earth and we are making it greater
trump, Every single day, greater than ever before
trump, Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country

trump, Thank you, New Hampshire
trump, Thank you
trump,
trump, Wow, thank you
trump, Thank you, New Mexico
trump, Thank you
trump, We love being with you
trump, We love being with you
trump, Incredible people, incredible people
trump, Thank you very much
trump, And I'm thrilled to be here in Albuquerque with thousands of hard-working, freedom-loving American patriots
trump, Thank you
trump, Incredible
trump, We're all united by the same love of our great country
trump, And by the way, our country is doing great
trump, You see it
trump, The same devotion to family and the same profound faith that America is blessed by, the eternal grace of Almighty God
trump, Good night to that person
trump, Tomorrow they'll say, Massive protest
trump, No, one person just going home to mommy a little bit sooner
trump, Good night
trump, But we're bound by these convictions
trump, We will campaign for every vote, and we will win the great state of New Mexico in 2020
trump, And by the way, you have thousands and thousands of people outside who can't get in
trump, So we love you, we love you, we appreciate it
trump, We try to get the biggest arena we can get, and they're never big enough, frankly
trump, So there's something going on
trump, And I always say, 2016, I don't know if there'll ever be another 2016
trump, But right now it's like a great tree or a great plant, you plant it and it has to take hold
trump, We have to win 2020
trump, We're doing so well
trump, We have to win 2020
trump, And every day, and you know as well as I do, we're battling against the corrupt establishment of the past, and we're achieving historic victories for the American people
trump, We're winning again
trump, We're winning again, and we're winning big
trump, We're winning big
trump, Crucially for your state, we have ended the last administration's war on American energy
trump, And since my election, natural gas productions, big story today, in New Mexico has increased by 40, 4-0
trump, And that means great wages, and it means jobs
trump, And that's why you're breaking every single record in your state's book
trump, Crude oil production in New Mexico has more than doubled, and going up a lot higher very quickly
trump, And your state's energy revenues are up by nearly two-thirds
trump, Think of that
trump, Two-thirds
trump, And that's in a short period of time
trump, Give me a little bit more time, okay The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world
trump, And this means more jobs, higher wages, and American energy independence, which is what we have
trump, A few years ago, if we had a problem like you saw two days ago in the Middle East, we would've been in a panic
trump, Although, not if I were your president
trump, We never panic
trump, We don't want to panic
trump, But a few years ago, they would have been in a panic
trump, Today we got a lot of oil, we got a lot of gas
trump, We got a lot of oil and gas
trump, We don't have to send too many boats over there
trump, Did you notice the other day, they were saying, We don't see too many American ships anymore
trump, You know why Because we don't need … We're independent, as independent as we want
trump, And we are now a net exporter of energy
trump, Revenues from energy production provide up to 25 of your state's budget and going much higher in the very near future
trump, And they've generated nearly a billion-dollar budget surplus in New Mexico
trump, Thank you very much, president Trump
trump, Thank you
trump, Now, under the Green New Deal, that all goes away
trump, That all goes away
trump, It all goes away
trump, You can forget it
trump, No more cows, no more airplanes, no more trips
trump, A single car
trump, Make it electric
trump, Single car
trump, You're not allowed to travel more than 162 miles
trump, They'll call us the hermit nation
trump, We'll never leave our house
trump, No, it's crazy
trump, But that's okay
trump, I don't want to bring it up because I don't want to do it too early
trump, Maybe they'll change, and I don't want them to change
trump, But think of it for you, and for Texas, and for so many other places, they want to get rid of your energy
trump, I mean, explain that one
trump, Explain that
trump, Yet, every major Democrat running for president, they want to abolish all production of oil and natural gas
trump, In other words, the Democrats want to completely annihilate New Mexico's economy
trump, The Democrats want us to be subservient to foreign producers
trump, They want us to be at the mercy of rogue regimes
trump, That's not happening anymore
trump, It's been a long time
trump, It's been a long time
trump, It's not happening anymore
trump, But Democrats will never get the chance because New Mexico will never give them that chance
trump, Under this administration, America is working again
trump, America is winning again
trump, And America is respected again, like it hasn't been for a long time
trump, And I can tell you because I meet so many of the leaders, and their presidents, and their kings, and their queens, and their prime ministers, and their everything, dictators every once in a while
trump, Every once in a while, you get an a rogue dictator
trump, And I'll tell you, they always start off, today I had the Crown Prince of Bahrain, and they come in and they say, Sir, I'd like to congratulate you on what you've done with the economy of the United States
trump, It's a model for the entire world
trump, They all say it
trump, And earlier today … Do we have any baseball fans Right Right You know what I'm going to say
trump, But earlier today in the White House, I had the honor of awarding the Presidential Medal of Freedom, that's the highest civilian award, to someone who truly embodies the American dream, baseball legend, the greatest, by the way, the greatest relief pitcher of all time, you look at those records, Mariano Rivera
trump, He was something
trump, The Yankees won a lot of World Series because of Mariano
trump, Great guy
trump, We gave him the medal
trump, Done so much for charity
trump, A fantastic man, fantastic family
trump, It was a beautiful day at the White House, so it was good
trump, My administration is fighting to empower all Americans to reach their dreams and achieve their potential
trump, We have created six million new jobs since election day
trump, The fake news would never have allowed us to say that during the campaign, even as a projection
trump, Unemployment recently reached its lowest rate in over 50 years
trump, More than seven million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps
trump, Nearly 600,000 Americans came into the labor force last month alone
trump, Think of that
trump, Wages in your state, New Mexico, are growing at a rate of much more than 3 a year, which is unheard of 20 years ago
trump, And I used to say during the campaign, you go back, it's hard to believe, I'm here almost three years … Can you believe how time is flying Can you believe it I don't know about it me, but you look all much better than you did three years ago
trump, You're wealthier
trump, And even with the Me Too movement, we can't say this, but I'll say it anyway, you're better looking, including the men, including the men
trump, Now you're all looking good
trump, Since my election, the number of new business applications for New Mexico has increased by almost 30, more than any state in the United States
trump, Think of that
trump, More than any state in the United States
trump, So essentially, that's saying you're in a certain category, which is a very important category, you're doing better than any state in the United States
trump, How do I lose New Mexico Explain that one, right How do we lose that one And yet, for whatever reason, it's been quite a while since a Republican won this state
trump, But we're going to win this state
trump, And I think we're going to win this state easy
trump, You had to see the people all the way in from the airport
trump, That was a long drive by the way, 35 minutes
trump, That was a long drive
trump, But all the way in, we had people, and they were waving
trump, And I didn't see any negative hand gesture, right No, I think we're going to do great here
trump, And we're here for a number of reasons, but we're here because we really think we're going to turn this state and make it a Republican state
trump, Yesterday marked the beginning of the Hispanic Heritage Month
trump, Who is Hispanic here Latinos for Trump
trump, Thank you
trump, Incredible people
trump, But we have much to celebrate
trump, Unbelievable when you think, the unemployment for Hispanic-Americans is right now at the lowest level ever recorded in the history of our country
trump, Hispanic-American poverty reached a brand new all-time low in history
trump, And after years of stagnation that you know very well, wages for Hispanic-Americans are rising really fast, up nearly 8 since my election
trump, Those are unheard of numbers
trump, They're unheard of
trump, And median income, think of that, median income for Hispanic-Americans surpassed 50,000 for the first time ever
trump, That's your median
trump, That's not bad
trump, That means you're wealthy and you're getting wealthier fast
trump, And I just want to tell you it's an honor
trump, But when I'm on the debate stage debating one of these far left radical Democrats, whoever it may be, and they start telling you what they're going to do for you, and you say, But we have the best numbers, every category, that we've ever had
trump, Hispanic-Americans … excuse me, New Mexico as a whole, we have the best numbers
trump, African-Americans, the best numbers that we've ever had in the history of our country
trump, Asian-Americans, the best numbers that we've ever had in history
trump, Women, the best numbers that we've had in 71 years
trump, We're working night and day to deliver a future of limitless opportunity for our nation's Hispanic-American citizens, including millions and millions of extraordinary Mexican-Americans who enrich our society, strengthen our country, serve in our military, and contribute immensely to our shared American family
trump, And I want to just tell you that Mexico is doing a great job for us on the border, and I want to thank the president of Mexico
trump, You know, it's very interesting, I hear everybody screaming, well, you know we're building the wall, and it's going up, and it's going up fast
trump, And if you think that's easy with the Democrats who control the House, we have to take it back, but if you think it's easy … But we're building a lot of wall
trump, We'll have almost 500 miles of wall built by the end the next year, and it's making a big difference
trump, 500 miles
trump, But you know we won a big case two months ago in the Supreme Court that allowed us to do what we're doing
trump, This has been … I'll tell you what
trump, Ready Another president would have given up a long time ago
trump, We don't give up
trump, So we're building the wall, the Army Corps of Engineers, we're doing a beautiful job
trump, It's a great, it's a great structure
trump, It's a great structure
trump, You're going to have to really want to get over that wall, to do it
trump, But it was very interesting because, not too long ago, I saw where the Hispanic-American, the Hispanics, were up with me in a poll, 17
trump, And everyone said, How is that How is that How is that 17
trump, Up by 17
trump, I won't even tell you what the final number was because they won't believe it, but you're going to see what the final number … But you know why Because the Hispanic-Americans, they understand, they don't want criminals coming across the border
trump, They don't want people taking their jobs
trump, They want to have that security, and they want the wall
trump, They want the wall
trump, And we have a man in the audience who is, I think, the best dressed man in this entire place, including me, right here
trump, Look at him
trump, Come here
trump, Look at him
trump, Look at this guy
trump, And he's been to a couple of rallies too, haven't you Huh We have some people, a group of people the other day, you know, we had a victory in North Carolina that was unbelievable
trump, Two of them
trump, One of them, it was going to be very, very close
trump, Here's another one of my friends
trump, Thank you
trump, I like that beautiful red tie you're wearing
trump, But we had a victory, two victories, North Carolina, where one was 17 points down three weeks ago, we got involved, we started sending out lots of different social media messages, we did a couple of little robo calls, but the big thing, we did a speech the night before
trump, The turnout was beyond belief
trump, And instead of being down by 17 points, he easily won the election 4,000 or 5,000 votes
trump, Dan, thank you, Dan
trump, Thank you, Dan Bishop
trump, And Greg Murphy was up a couple of points, and he ended up winning, I don't know, I'd ask the media, but they won't give me how many … What did he get Do you know Like 20, 21 He won by a lot
trump, He won by a lot
trump, I'd asked them, but we're not going to get a straight answer
trump, They were not happy
trump, They were not happy
trump, I'll tell you, Tuesday night, the fake news was not happy
trump, They had their studios all built
trump, CNN had their A- list talent
trump, They don't have A-list talent, but they had the best they could have
trump, And they were all set
trump, This was going to be the end of Trump, because this man was going to lose
trump, But he turned out to be tough and smart
trump, And in all fairness, I helped a lot too
trump, And toward the end of the night, they started dismantling that studio
trump, Probably it would have been there for four weeks
trump, This is the end
trump, But we had two great victories, congressional victories, on Tuesday night
trump, And it was something
trump, The one gentleman won by a number that nobody thought even possible, so much
trump, And the other won a race that he was way, way, way back
trump, In fact, I shouldn't tell you this, but my geniuses, my people, some of those people standing right there, right there, some of them right there, they said, Sir, don't get involved in that race, sir
trump, You can't come back from 17 points, sir
trump, It's too much
trump, I said, But you know, I really like the guy
trump, I think he's great
trump, Let's give it a shot
trump, They say, Sir, if you lose, they will never, ever … It'll be much worse
trump, I said, Let me tell you, I know them very well
trump, Whether I help him or don't help him, it's going to be the same
trump, It's going to be a disaster
trump, So let's help him
trump, And we campaigned, and we worked hard, right They said, Don't do it, sir
trump, Don't do it
trump, Please don't do it, sir
trump, It'll be very embarrassing
trump, I said, No, I don't mind being embarrassed
trump, I don't mind being embarrassed
trump, We're also very proud that unemployment among Native Americans has reached the lowest rate in nearly two decades
trump, And we're building an amazing future for citizens of every background, race, religion, color, and creed
trump, And that's what we have
trump, That's what we have
trump, Race, religion, color, and creed
trump, But the radical left Democrats want to demolish everything that we've gained
trump, They want to raise your taxes
trump, They want to bury you in regulation
trump, They want to take away your health insurance, 180 million Americans
trump, They want to erase American history, crush religious liberty, indoctrinate our students with left-wing ideology
trump, And left-wing Democrats want to confiscate your guns and eliminate your God-given right to self-defense
trump, You know that
trump, As your president, I will never allow them to take away your liberty, your dignity, and your social security
trump, And I will never, ever allow them to take away your sacred right to keep and bear arms
trump, The left tries to threaten, bully, intimidate Americans into submission
trump, They use Democrat prosecutors and phony congressional committees whenever they can
trump, They'll do whatever they can to demean you, to libel you
trump, They try to blacklist, coerce, cancel, or destroy anyone who gets in their way
trump, Look at what they're doing today to Justice Kavanaugh
trump, Look at what they're doing
trump, Did you see the New York Times Did you see what they're doing Did you see what Democrats, they're calling for his resignation
trump, They're calling for his impeachment
trump, And the woman involved said she didn't know anything
trump, But they still, so the New York Times had to put out a major apology, and they had to change their story
trump, The woman said, I don't remember that
trump, Can you believe And they still want him to be impeached
trump, And I just put out a statement
trump, And he's a great man, by the way, a great talent
trump, A great brilliant man, Brett Kavanaugh
trump, and I just put out a statement on social media that said, I don't think they'll do it, but they should, for the good of the nation, I call for the resignation of everybody at the New York Times involved in the Kavanaugh smear story
trump, And while you're at it, the Russian witch-hunt hoax, which is just as phony a story
trump, They've taken, the old gray lady, do you know the New York Times, for years, the old gray lady, so prestigious, they've taken the old great lady and broken her down, destroyed her virtue, and ruined her reputation
trump, She can never recover, and will never return to greatness under current management
trump, The Times is dead
trump, Long live The New York Times
trump, Long lived The New York Times
trump, And I do want it to live, but they have to be, they have to change their ways
trump, Think of it, they wrote a story about somebody that said she doesn't remember this
trump, Can you even believe it And yet, all of these radical left crazies are in judiciary committee and all of these committees that are set up to hurt the country
trump, With all that we have going, with Saudi Arabia, with Iran, with China trade deal, with Russia, with North Korea, with all that we have going, look at the cards that we've been dealt, lucky we won the election in 2016, believe me
trump, With all that we have going, they say, Let's impeach Justice Kavanaugh, one of the smartest, most brilliant students, top at Yale, incredible life, incredible family
trump, Let's impeach him
trump, It's a made-up story
trump, Let's impeach President Trump
trump, Think of that
trump, The Muller Report came out
trump, Think of this
trump, This crazy Mueller Report comes out, 18 Trump haters, liberal Democrats, some worked for Hillary Clinton, they found nothing
trump, No, think of it
trump, After two years, they found nothing
trump, They spent 40 million
trump, There's not a person in the room that I couldn't find something on with that
trump, They spent, think of it, they found nothing
trump, No collusion, no obstruction, no nothing
trump, To stop the far left's campaign of destruction, you must vote Republican
trump, And you're going to get the chance very soon
trump, We're joined tonight by many terrific Republican leaders, and somebody that's done an incredible job, she ran Michigan for me
trump, And as you know, for the presidential races, Michigan hadn't been won in decades, and she kept saying, Could you come back, sir I didn't know who she was
trump, I said, Who the heck is the woman in Michigan that keeps asking She said, Sir, if you keep coming back, you're going to win Michigan
trump, Hasn't been won in decades
trump, And I won Michigan
trump, Remember that great, great night November
trump, That great, great night
trump, Donald Trump has won the great state of Michigan
trump, And they were going crazy on television
trump, They were going, that was not a good night- Going crazy on television
trump, They were going, that was not a good night for certain people
trump, Remember the couple of people that were crying I guess they don't like a strong military
trump, They don't like cutting regulations
trump, They don't like low taxes
trump, They don't like Right to Try, you know Right to Try
trump, All these things we've done
trump, For the Vets, we got choice
trump, We got choice for the Vets
trump, Choice
trump, Everybody said it was impossible
trump, We've rebuilt our military
trump, I told this story for the first time today
trump, A general came into my office in my first few weeks, you remember It was a little dangerous out there
trump, President Obama left us with a few beauties, right And I said to this general, You better be prepared, because this is looking like it could really be conflict
trump, And he looked at me and he goes, Sir, we have very little ammunition
trump, I said, Say it again
trump, And I want to tell you the words, very little, he didn't use because it was less than that
trump, And I said, I never want to see a president in a position like that, where we may have conflict, and a general looks at him and said, ‘We have very little no ammunition
trump,' I never want a president of the United States to be in that position
trump, And since then, three years, 700 billion we've spent, then 716 billion
trump, And now, 738 billion
trump, And our military is by far the greatest in the world
trump, There's nobody that even comes close
trump, So anyway, no president should ever be put in that position
trump, And by the way, no president should ever have to go through what I've gone through either
trump, That should never happen
trump, What happened is a disgrace to our country
trump, No president should ever have to go through it
trump, And I'll tell you what, 99 of them would never have been able to take it
trump, They wouldn't have been able to take it
trump, But we won the great state of Michigan, and now we're doing really well, because we've moved a lot of car companies
trump, I tell Japan, sorry, big deficits with all these countries, we're changing it, but you've got to get car companies
trump, We're building car companies now in Michigan
trump, They're not going to be leaving for lots of other countries, including China, including Mexico
trump, They're going to stay home, and they're going to pay you a lot of money, and everybody's going to be happy
trump, But Michigan's doing great
trump, And Ronna McDaniel was the Republican Party chair of Michigan
trump, So when we won the election, I said, Let's get the woman from Michigan to run the RNC
trump, And she has done an incredible job
trump, Thank you Ronna
trump, A great gentleman who loves the Republican Party, co-chairman, Tommy Hicks
trump, Tommy, what a job
trump, New Mexico Republican party chairman
trump, Steve Pearce
trump, My friend and a really talented guy, he just gets the hell knocked out of him all the time
trump, Brad Parscale
trump, What a job he's doing, Brad
trump, Great job, Brad
trump, Great job
trump, And another great friend of mine, somebody that was on CNN, and they didn't like him because he was too positive on Trump
trump, Can you believe it He happens to be Hispanic
trump, He happens to be Hispanic, but I've never quite figured it out, because he looks more like a wasp than I do
trump, So I haven't figured that one out
trump, But I'll tell you what
trump, There is nobody that loves his country more or Hispanic more than Steve Cortez, Steve
trump, Thank you Steve
trump, Nobody loves the Hispanics more
trump, Who do you like more, the country or the Hispanics He says the country
trump, I don't know
trump, I may have to go for the Hispanics to be honest
trump, We got a lot of Hispanics
trump, We love our Hispanics
trump, Get out and vote
trump, You know, just before the last election, the Cubans from Miami where we got a tremendous percentage of the vote, close to 90
trump, they gave me the Bay of Pigs award
trump, Can you imagine, right The Bay of Pigs award
trump, And the Venezuelans and the Cubans are all for Trump, I will tell you that
trump, They're all for Trump
trump, They like what we're doing
trump, With the help of, and Steve, I want to thank you very much by the way, and you were incredible on CNN, and now you'll get a real job
trump, Okay Steve, that audience wasn't big enough for you
trump, Their ratings aren't good
trump, With the help of everyone here tonight, we're taking power out of Washington and giving it back to the great people of our country, and to the people of New Mexico
trump, We've cut a record number of job-killing regulations, saving the average American household 3,000
trump, We passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history
trump, What that means is a typical family of four in New Mexico making 75,000 has seen their tax bill reduced by more than 2,000
trump, And it's one of the reasons that as the world is not doing great, you look at Europe, and you look at Asia, and China's not doing too well
trump, I must be honest with you, worst year in 57 years, I'd say that's not good
trump, But I hope they still like me
trump, And we've taken in tens of billions of dollars worth of tariffs, and we've given those tariffs, and by the way, China's eating the tariffs, they're devaluing their currency, the prices are very similar
trump, They're eating the tariffs
trump, And out of the tens of billions we gave our great farmers, because they were targeted by China, because China knows, very smart, that the farmers love Trump, and Trump loves the farmers
trump, I said to our Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Perdue, I said, Sonny, how much did the farmers get hit by China targeting them and pulling back and doing all sorts of things He said, 16 billion
trump, I said, That's okay
trump, We'll take 16 billion out of a much, much, much larger number
trump, We're going to give it to the farmers, so that they're even
trump, And I tell you, the farmers do love Trump, they do love Trump
trump, And to keep New Mexico's farms, ranches, and small businesses in the family, we eliminated the unfair estate tax or death tax, so that you can now give your farm or your ranch to your children
trump, Now, if you don't like your children, don't do it
trump, But when it's your time to kick the bucket, you worked hard
trump, You have great kids, you love your kids, they're taking care of you
trump, You really love them
trump, It's a great thing
trump, If you don't love them, don't even listen to the last line, because it won't matter
trump, Don't leave it to them
trump, If they're not good, leave it to charity
trump, Leave it to something else
trump, Don't get it to them
trump, I know a guy who can't stand his children, they're horrible, horrible human beings
trump, They're a little older now, but they're horrible human beings
trump, He wants to leave his wealth
trump, I said, Why would you leave them They don't even like you
trump, But on the assumption that you love your children, you'll be able to use small farms and your ranches and things
trump, You'll be able to leave them to your children
trump, Your children won't have to go out and borrow a fortune to pay tax
trump, They won't be losing it to the banks five years later
trump, We got rid of it
trump, That's a big deal
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you
trump, Our shared Republican agenda is pro-worker, pro-jobs, pro-family, pro-growth, and 100 pro-American
trump, For many decades, our leaders put global interests and special interests ahead of your interests
trump, You know that, in New Mexico, you know exactly what I'm talking about
trump, People came in, they took your jobs, they had no border, they had no border control
trump, Look at what's going on now, how we're doing
trump, I mean, honestly, I mentioned the president of Mexico
trump, We have today 27,000 Mexican soldiers on the border protecting our country
trump, And I'll take it
trump, Because our laws are so bad, they're so pathetic
trump, And the Democrats could change these laws
trump, They could change them so quickly
trump, We could change them all in less than an hour
trump, We could, whether it's asylum, whether it's any of the laws, we have so many of them that are so bad
trump, How they got that, it took years and years to end up
trump, But we have the Mexican soldiers out there
trump, You see them, and they're stopping people
trump, The numbers are plummeting down
trump, So I just want to thank all of the representatives of Mexico
trump, Amazing
trump, Well, we've got to get rid of the loopholes
trump, You know, the word is loopholes, and the Democrats could do it fast
trump, But in the meantime, we're doing really well
trump, And as the wall goes up, it becomes less and less of a problem, because as the wall gets up, people aren't getting through
trump, I mean you got to be a a world class pole vaulter, or a world class Mount Everest type climber
trump, There's not too many around like that
trump, It's really doing the trick
trump, The failed liberal establishment in Washington squandered your tax dollars, shipped away your jobs, sacrificed your sovereignty, and bogged us down in one foreign war, or debacle, call it whatever you want after another
trump, And that's changing also, you see what's happening, and when these rich countries think we're going to pay for their military every year, billions and billions and billions, and they're rich, and they take our business and we're supposed to, on top of everything else, I could tell you stories, but I'm going to save them for the campaign
trump, Because to be honest, this is a little earlier than the campaign
trump, Wait until this campaign starts, you know, like I was telling Brad and I was telling a few of the folks, one thing I don't want to do, Michael back there, Michael, hello
trump, What a job he's done
trump, But I'm telling them I don't want to do this too early
trump, I don't want to do it
trump, You know the Pocahontas thing, I did that, it was before its time
trump, Right It was before it's time
trump, Too early
trump, 1,024
trump, That means I have more Indian blood than she does, and I have none, unfortunately
trump, I'd like to say I have a lot
trump, Got to get me another 4
trump, maybe another 10
trump, but I was early with her, and frankly, oh it's coming back, don't worry about her
trump, But those days are over under this administration
trump, We are finally putting America first
trump, Putting it first
trump, We're reversing decades of calamitous trade policies that ravished our industries and devastated communities all across our land
trump, You see the factories, empty buildings, empty hulks
trump, Some have been demolished, some have been reconverted into senior citizen housing and housing
trump, But all those jobs are gone, and we're bringing them back
trump, They're coming back like almost never before
trump, Probably, I can say they're coming back like never before
trump, People are coming back now, because they want to be where the action is
trump, And this is the country where they have the security, and where they do have the action
trump, In my first week in office, I proudly withdrew from the last administration's job-destroying… and this was a catastrophe
trump, You know, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, TPP, this would have destroyed the automobile business in our country
trump, Now New Mexico, you know that you were totally devastated by another disaster known as NAFTA
trump, Your state lost 33 of its manufacturing jobs after NAFTA was signed
trump, This was one of the great catastrophes
trump, And now we're replacing NAFTA with the brand new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, USMCA
trump, Think of the song YMCA
trump, YMCA
trump, Think of the song
trump, USMCA, that's US-Mexico-Canada Agreement
trump, And it's drawing strong Bipartisan support from all across your state, and all across the country
trump, It's amazing
trump, I want to just, yeah
trump, the Dona Ana County Board of Commissioners, all Democrats just unanimously endorsed the USMCA, and urged Congress to pass it immediately
trump, Thank you very much commissioners
trump, All Democrats
trump, Hopefully they'll put it up for a vote
trump, Nancy Pelosi, they put it up for vote
trump, It's going to be very popular
trump, The Republicans love it, and the Democrats love it, and frankly, labor loves it
trump, Unions love it
trump, Farmers love, love, love it, and everybody wants it
trump, Your farmers, your ranchers, everybody wants it
trump, It's an incredible agreement
trump, And Mexico's already passed it, and Canada's ready to pass it, soon as we do
trump, See, they don't maybe trust us, that's why
trump, They say, Why aren't you passing it now They say, Oh, we'll pass it
trump, They're going to pass it as soon as we do
trump, Past leaders invited China to freely loot and pillage the United States economy
trump, China's been taking out from 300 billion to 500 billion a year
trump, Billion, not million
trump, Billion
trump, Think of what 500 billion is
trump, We've rebuilt China, but now it's a different ball game
trump, Somebody had to do something with China
trump, President Obama should have done it
trump, Presidents Bush should have done it
trump, President Clinton should have done it
trump, They all should have done it
trump, Frankly, they all should have done a lot of things that we're doing right now
trump, So if you look at it, nobody did it, so I'm doing it, and that's what's going to happen
trump, We're doing well
trump, So now we're taking in billions and billions of dollars from China
trump, When in the past, we never got 25 cents
trump, We never got money
trump, We never got anything
trump, You know what we got Unemployment and losses
trump, And some cheap pencils
trump, More than we needed
trump, You could do with one less pencil
trump, Following decades of outsourcing and offshoring, our jobs and factories are coming back home where they belong
trump, If foreign companies do not want to pay our tariffs, there is one very simple solution
trump, Come and make your product in America
trump, Come and make your product in New Mexico
trump, And by the way, I'm just seeing this great group of people, this spirit, is there any place in the world that's more fun or more exciting than a Trump rally Really Is there anything When you think about it, it's not about fun
trump, It's about achievement
trump, Because what we've achieved in the last almost three years is unparalleled
trump, There's never been an administration that in the first two and a half years has done what we've been able to do or achieve
trump, In a few short weeks, we'll be up to 180, sounds impossible, federal judges including court of appeals judges
trump, Because President Obama did us a great favor when I came in, I said, I assume I have no judges to appoint
trump, No sir, you have 138 judges
trump, 138 Didn't put them up, couldn't get them approved
trump, I don't know what happened, but we started off with 138, now we're up to 180
trump, I just signed my 150th federal judge, and court of appeals judge, and we already have two great Supreme Court justices, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh
trump, Great, great men
trump, So think of that
trump, You know, you come in, and I've always heard the most important thing a president does, I disagree with this by the way, but that's okay
trump, I disagree with a lot of things
trump, Because I think the most important thing is our military, and protecting our country, right But have you listened to the so-called Washington elite, now why are they elite We do better than they do, we're smarter than them
trump, We make more money, we have better houses, we have better everything, and then they say the elite
trump, That means you're the super elite
trump, I've always take offense when somebody said, President Trump is tired of listening to the elite
trump, I said, No, no, I'm more elite than them
trump, Right I think so
trump, I mean, if we go by the old standards, better houses, better schools, made much more money, lived better, had everything going, and then I decide to run for president
trump, And I'll be honest, while we have to put up with these people, and others are, it's incredible
trump, But it's the greatest single decision I've ever made, because our country is turning around so rapidly
trump, I could not be happier, despite what they put us all through
trump, Could not be happier
trump, After years of building up other countries, we're finally building up our country
trump, Isn't that nice It's time to finally take care of our own
trump, And we're all so aggressively combating the opioid epidemic, which is horrible
trump, And as a result of our nonstop efforts, and billions and billions of dollars invested, last year we saw the first nationwide decline in drug overdose deaths, and it was a very big decline in nearly three decades
trump, 30 years
trump, And at the center of America's drug crisis, this is where the Hispanics know it better than anybody
trump, People said, Oh, the Hispanics won't like a wall
trump, I said, I think they're going to love it
trump, They won't like border security
trump, I think they going to love it
trump, You know why Because you understand it better than other people, but at the whole center of this crisis is the drugs that are pouring in, and you understand that when other people don't understand it
trump, The border crisis, every day dangerous criminal cartels smuggle vast quantities of lethal narcotics across your Southern border, including heroin, meth, cocaine, and fentanyl, and we're stopping them now
trump, You see the kind of numbers, we're getting millions and millions and millions of dollars worth
trump, We've had some shipments where it could kill half of the country, some of the fentanyl and some of the bad, really bad stuff
trump, If it were distributed, it could actually, has the power to kill half of the country
trump, This is like a warlike situation
trump, That's why you're liking Trump, because you're not going to let that happen
trump, If you want to stop the drug smugglers and the human traffickers, how about the human traffic and they traffic really for the most part in women, that's what they traffic in, it's women
trump, They're not trafficking in men
trump, They capture women, and they bring them across the open borders, and they don't go through ports of entry, where you have guards standing there with guns and rifles and everything else
trump, They go out into the desert areas, and they hang a left, or they hang a right and they come in, but now when you have a wall, they can't do that
trump, Right They can't do that
trump, And so many of these Democrats that are against the wall, it's common sense Look, you know what I saw the other day Where the Democrats are having their convention, their national convention, they just gave out a tremendous contract
trump, You know what it's for They're building a big wall around the building, they're building a big wall
trump, A massive wall
trump, We should tell them, open borders
trump, Let anybody come in
trump, And a few years ago, almost every one of these, they're on tape
trump, That's the problem with politics
trump, Three years ago, they could say, look, I saw Senator Schumer, I saw Nancy… I saw all of them
trump, They said, No, we need a wall
trump, We must have a wall
trump, President Obama, We must have a wall
trump, We must stop people from coming into our country illegally
trump, We have to stop it
trump, We need a wall
trump, Now, a few years later, they don't want a wall
trump, You know why Because anything I want, they want to do the opposite
trump, And that's okay
trump, That's the only reason
trump, But if you want to stop the drug smugglers, human traffickers and vicious MS-3 gang members, which we're taking out every year by the thousands, and getting them the hell out of our country, because of ICE
trump, And if you want to stop all these people from threatening our communities and poisoning our youth, you know it's poisoning our youth
trump, That's what it is, it's nothing other than that, it's very simple
trump, They're poisoning our youth
trump, You have only one choice
trump, You must elect Republicans
trump, And to be honest with you, you've got to elect President Trump
trump, We need four more years
trump, President Trump
trump, How about these phony Democrats They started with Russia, Russia, Russia
trump, That turned out to be be a fraud
trump, That turned out to be a fraud
trump, Then they went to race
trump, Do you believe that one Race
trump, I'm the least racist person in this room
trump, Then they went to recession, there's going to be a recession
trump, Oh please, let there be a recession, please
trump, Because we have a better chance of defeating him if there's a recession
trump, And unfortunately, the stock market's only a few points from its all time high, which we've broken on, I think it's well over a hundred times
trump, We broke the all time record
trump, And now they have a new one
trump, And I'm enriching myself
trump, Let me tell you, by doing this and taking this particular job, which I love, it will cost me billions and billions of dollars, but if somebody from the Middle East that I never saw before, comes in and stays in one of my hotels for an evening, and pays 439, emoluments
trump, Nobody ever heard the word emolument before
trump, Emolument, nobody ever heard that word, emolument
trump, He's enriching himself
trump, If somebody buys a tank of gas in Scotland, from an airport that I don't own, and they happen to go to a hotel, he's enriching himself, like 20 people, I'm going to lose billions of dollars, and that's okay
trump, I expected to do that when I did it
trump, I didn't know what would happen if I lost
trump, Can you imagine Supposing I lost, and we would have had the same basic rhetoric
trump, I mean, winning was great
trump, Supposing, you know, I'm doing all the things
trump, I'm telling you all the same sort of things
trump, Supposing I didn't make it
trump, I'd have to go around
trump, I would've lost and lost billions, then I would have been really unhappy
trump, But I'll tell you what, I expected that when I did this, in terms of opportunity, in terms of certain places, they can never do as well when you have this kind of rhetoric, they can never do
trump, So I'll lose billions of dollars, always expected
trump, They say, I enrich myself because somebody is going to stay at my hotel
trump, It doesn't work that way folks
trump, And these are very, very dishonest people, and they know it
trump, So they've given up on every other hoax, but it doesn't work that way
trump, You know it too
trump, You get it
trump, The democrat agenda of open borders places vast burdens on your communities, and your schools, and your hospitals, and public safety all at the expense of hardworking New Mexico families, and throughout our country
trump, Sheriffs, and commissioners from nine Mexico counties recently sent a letter to your state's congressional delegation begging them to vote for strong border security they want in New Mexico
trump, They don't want open borders
trump, They don't want criminals pouring into your communities, and doing what they do, and we won't even talk about that
trump, They want strong, these are people that are with you in many cases, Democrats
trump, They write letters, we need strong border security
trump, In San Diego, California is very difficult
trump, Always complaining, not doing great, but they wanted a wall in San Diego, good mayor in San Diego by the way
trump, They wanted a wall
trump, And I said, You know what, let's build it someplace else
trump, Because California, you know, once we build it, they'll complain
trump, But then I said, You know, the people are pouring in
trump, They needed it
trump, They're pouring into San Diego, like going all over the place
trump, And people that had houses, they didn't like people running over their gardens all day long, coming in from the other side
trump, So we put up a wall, and I thought everybody would be happy
trump, As soon as it was finished, the day it was finished, I was notified
trump, We didn't want the wall
trump, Why did you do the wall And I will tell you, in other words, it's all a game
trump, I'd love to take the sucker down and move it right now to New Mexico
trump, And if I did that, they'd go crazy
trump, And they'd say, Please sir, don't do that
trump, Please, please
trump, The same people that are saying, We don't want a wall
trump, Why did you put up a wall And I knew that was going to happen
trump, I told my people that was going to happen
trump, But they're very happy with their wall
trump, Most of them won't say it
trump, They love it
trump, It stopped… it only stopped 99
trump,9 of the people coming in
trump, And the only reason I'm not moving it to New Mexico is that it would cost more money to move it than to build you a brand new, beautiful wall, so I'll give you a brand new beautiful wall
trump, … New beautiful wall, I'll give you a brand-new one
trump, It's true
trump, It's true
trump, I actually priced it out
trump, It's true
trump, These contractors, all my life I've been deal… They can find a way to make money
trump, Sir, it'll cost more money to move the wall that they built a new one
trump, They have it, but the commission your commissioners wrote, I quote, Our communities do not have the resources nor the budgets to handle the massive influx of immigrants we are experiencing
trump, This is your commissioners writing to us in Washington
trump, Our scarce resources are in danger of being rapidly depleted to the point that we will be unable to effectively care for our own citizens, you, and our existing homeless populations, many of whom are American veterans, right So, Democrats put illegal aliens before American citizens
trump, Republicans believe that we must take care of our own citizens first
trump, I'm sorry
trump, That includes millions of hardworking, lawful immigrants who waited in line, followed the rules, and came into our country legally
trump, And among those hardest hit by illegal immigration are Hispanic Americans who obey our laws, pay their taxes, contribute to our communities and play by the rules, and they're the ones that want to see something done and we are doing it at a level that nobody else would be capable of doing it
trump, Whether you're a first generation or a 10th generation, every American citizen deserves a government that defends your jobs, your safety, your family, and is always loyal to you
trump, Your politicians have not been loyal to you
trump, They have been loyal to themselves
trump, The Democrats are also trying to turn every city in America into a sanctuary for criminal aliens, and that's one of the very good reasons we won on Tuesday night, North Carolina, because they let people out of their sanctuary city and what those people did, I will not tell you tonight, but it wasn't good
trump, It's one of the reasons we had big victories, two of them in North Carolina, sanctuary cities
trump, And plenty of people, even in California where they have sanctuary cities, they don't want sanctuary cities
trump, The politicians do, but they don't want them
trump, Right here in New Mexico, Democrats are trying to turn you into a total sanctuary state, creating a safe harbor for dangerous criminal aliens and gang members that sanctuary policies release from jail
trump, Now, think of it
trump, They want to make your whole state a sanctuary state
trump, So, when MS-13 comes in, and I told you before, we take them out by the thousands and they're tough
trump, They're tough, but our ICE folks are even tougher
trump, There's nobody tougher
trump, I would say naive, but maybe it's much worse than that
trump, They're naive, these politicians
trump, The naive politicians, they don't want ICE to come in
trump, They don't want to take these criminals out
trump, And if you don't take them out and they're in New Mexico, I got to tell you something, folks
trump, You got problems
trump, You got problems
trump, You've got big problems
trump, Republicans believe our cities should be sanctuaries for law abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens
trump, And Republicans will always support the heroes of ICE, border patrol and our great law enforcement
trump, The Democrat party… Do you notice I always say the Democrat party You know, before I came, they were all calling it Democratic because it sounds better, right It does
trump, It's much nicer
trump, The Democratic party is much nicer than the Democrat party, but their name is the Democrat party, and I'm not looking for them to sound nice
trump, I want to give their name
trump, So, I always say the Democrat party, but that's their name, the Democrat party
trump, Frankly, they should probably change it because it does… And then I'd call them the Democratic party, but the Democrat party has never been farther outside the mainstream
trump, Every major… That's a nasty fly
trump, I don't like those suckers
trump, I don't know about you in New Mexico, but I'm not into flies or mosquitoes
trump, I don't like snakes too much
trump, We have plenty of them in New York and Washington, a different variety
trump, I don't like snakes either
trump, We got a lot of snakes in Washington DC
trump, We got a lot of steaks in New York
trump, I don't like either kind of snake
trump, I think I like the kind on the ground better than the ones we have in Washington
trump, Every major Democrat running for president supports a massive government takeover of healthcare that would destroyed Medicare as we know it today
trump, My administration will protect Medicare and defend your right to choose the plan and the doctor that is best for you
trump, And we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions
trump, The Republicans will always do that
trump, Our ambitious campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs has produced the largest decline in drug prices in more than 50 years
trump, You don't hear this because the fake news doesn't want to write about it
trump, Sometimes I'll have a news conference about something that's so good and I'll say, you know… I'll call my wife, first lady, first lady
trump, People love our first lady
trump, I'll say, Wait until you see television tonight, and we did something that was so great, whatever it may be
trump, We did a lot of things
trump, We did something so great and it won't be on, but if there's something that's just slightly negative or even if it's good that they could turn negative, that's what they like best
trump, Take something good and turn it negative
trump, It's breaking… We have breaking news
trump, We have breaking news
trump, These are phony people, but that's okay
trump, You know, when you think of it, I'm president and they're not
trump, Crazy
trump, It's crazy
trump, You know, sometimes I'll be in the oval office and I'll be with my people
trump, We have great people, and I'll say, You know, and it's great comm in the oval office
trump, You don't like to hear about it because you don't hear about it too much
trump, That's not what they… But we have great comm considering it's pretty wild stuff going on in the world, right But I'll be saying, You know, they don't treat us right
trump, They don't treat us right
trump, It's not fair
trump, It's not this
trump, And then I'll just sit back, I'll say, But we're in the oval office and they're not
trump, It's pretty amazing
trump, It's pretty amazing
trump, And when you have the Democrat party and the press, the media, the lame stream media, the fake news, and they're partners… They are partners, okay Remember the word Manufactured They used the word manufacturer on something, never been used for that thing, and every news gets The manufactured crisis started
trump, The next one, This crisis was manufactured
trump, Every one of them used the word Manufactured
trump, They know what I'm talking about now
trump, Now, that's called collusion, folks
trump, That's real collusion
trump, You have that, and so you have the Democrats, you have the media, their partners
trump, Then you have the deep state
trump, We're getting rid of a lot of them
trump, I'll tell you, we're finding them left and right
trump, Boom
trump, You take a look at what… I'll tell you what
trump, I'll tell you what
trump, You take a look at what we're doing with all of the things
trump, I'm not going to get into detail, but you know what I'm talking about
trump, Clean the swamp
trump, That's the ultimate cleaning of the swamp
trump, And then I hate to say this, but we have some Republicans, they're not good
trump, You call them a rhino
trump, They're rhinos
trump, The rhinos are worse, and some of them are worse than the Obama people, right They're worse than the Obama people
trump, They're worse than the Clinton people, but there aren't too many of them left
trump, They're pretty much on respirators
trump, They're gasping
trump, They're gasping for air, but we do have some bad people that you wouldn't believe
trump, I didn't hear you
trump, Why did you say why What I didn't hear that
trump, Virtually, every top Democrat also now supports late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mothers right up until the moment of birth, and that's why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God
trump, It's true
trump, Right I see it
trump, Just like mom, I see it
trump, Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, and socialism
trump, The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, and it is the party of the American dream
trump, We've achieved record funding for the US military
trump, All of that money, trillions and trillions of dollars spent all produced right here in the good old USA
trump, And I have to tell you, New Mexico, I know you're going to like this
trump, A lot of those trillions because you know when you do the 716 and the 730 and the 700 -billion, all of a sudden you're in trillions and I can save a lot of lines when I just say trillions
trump, A lot of that money's going to be spent in the state of the art military equipment that's being used at Holloman Air Force Base, White Sands Missile Range, Kirkland Air Force Base and many other vital New Mexico military installations that are going up as we speak
trump, That's also jobs, but more importantly than even jobs, incredible
trump, What you've done for the military, New Mexico, is incredible and we've remembered, but we're pouring a lot of money into New Mexico and that means a lot of good things
trump, And we're investing in our nation's nuclear security, including right here in New Mexico and Sandia National Laboratories and Los Alamos National Laboratory
trump, To protect American security, I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal
trump, It was no good and we oppose the toughest ever sanctions on the Iranian regime
trump, Watch how that works out, folks
trump, That'll be very good
trump, I recognized Israel's true capitol and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem
trump, And don't forget what I did for Israel with respect to Golan Heights
trump, Don't forget, right For years, you watched as your politicians apologize for America
trump, Now, you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for New Mexico
trump, And you must never forget
trump, Get out there and vote and get ready and get everybody
trump, We need it because we're fighting a lot of forces, including Facebook, I saw, and Google, I saw
trump, Did you see Google He said I may have lost two-million to 10-million votes, according to this character that worked at Google, right And we still won
trump, How the hell did we win Everybody was against us
trump, How did we win How did we win This is a Google executive
trump, From two-million to 10
trump,5-million votes, and we won
trump, I don't know, we must be doing… I will say this
trump, That happened and people came from the valleys
trump, They came from everywhere
trump, They Came from places that nobody's ever talked about before and it was the forgotten men and women, but the truth is I know these men and women and they're the most incredible men and women in this country
trump, They really are
trump, They just never had anybody they really wanted to vote for or at least for a long time, they didn't want to get out there
trump, They said, Oh, boy
trump, Oh, boy
trump, Is this the best they can do I mean, in all fairness, I don't want to go too early here
trump, Look at the field
trump, Did you watch the debate the other day We've got almost 350-million people
trump, I'll take it
trump, That's the best they can do
trump, We'll see
trump, We'll see
trump, You never want to get too cocky
trump, Somebody said in the great state of Texas, Donald Trump is down two points to Buttigieg
trump, Buttigieg
trump, Buttigieg
trump, They're phony polls
trump, You know they have phony polls
trump, I told this story the other night
trump, For six months, I was hearing that I'm going to lose the state of Texas and friends of mine from Texas that look just like these guys
trump, See these two guys with the hates They might even be better looking
trump, They look just like… And they want to say, I don't know about you, but I know a lot about Texas and Donald Trump is not going to be losing the state of Texas
trump, Remember that See, they don't say it's in play
trump, They're too smart
trump, They say Texas is in play
trump, And Utah, they said was it play
trump, All these are in play and play means we could lose them, right It's a better term though because this way, they can't get skunked, but they can get skunked with me
trump, So, what happens is on that beautiful election… Was that one of the greatest, coolest nights ever Well, they can never call a victory unless you absolutely have it and unless you're winning by a lot
trump, This is six months
trump, Texas is in play
trump, You know, he could lose Texas
trump, I keep saying, I go to a stadium, we sell out to thousands of people, lines that are miles long
trump, I mean, and every friend of mine says, You're going to win by a lot
trump, 00, whatever time, The polls in Texas are closed
trump, Donald Trump has won this state of Texas
trump, The polls in Utah are closed
trump, Donald Trump has won the state of Utah
trump, They don't even take a breath
trump, Now, if it's close like it's in play, you wait two, three, four or five hours to see what it is, but they don't even a breath because they're called suppression poles and they're no different than all of the dishonest reporting that you people see
trump, They're no different
trump, They're suppression polls, and I'll tell you what
trump, We're going to win the state of New Mexico and I'll be so surprised if we don't
trump, I'll be so surprised
trump, No, we're going to win New Mexico
trump, You know, when I came here during the last election, came here a little because I was told very hard to win and I came here a little, but I saw great spirit
trump, But I didn't really have a track record because I never did this stuff before
trump, So, I said I was going to cut your taxes
trump, I did
trump, I said I was going to cut your regulations
trump, I did more than any president in history and they've been there for many years
trump, I've been there for two and a half
trump, And I think the regulation cutting… Like the Waters of the US, that was another beauty where you couldn't build a house, you couldn't farm your land
trump, Now, what we've done on regulations is incredible
trump, I've done… I've rebuilt our military, I've taken care of our vets
trump, Look how happy our vets are with choice
trump, Instead of waiting for two months to see a doctor or two weeks or three days, they now go out
trump, If there's a wait, they go out, they get a private doctor
trump, They get taken care of
trump, We pay the bill
trump, And for the first time, they've tried to get that for 45 years, they haven't been able to get it, but I'm good at getting things
trump, You must never forget
trump, The 2020 election is about one thing
trump, What's it about It's about you
trump, It is
trump, It's about you
trump, It's about you
trump, I'm doing a good job as your messenger, but basically I'm a messenger
trump, I know what you want
trump, I understand that it's about your family
trump, It's about your future, and it's about the fate of your country for your children, for everybody
trump, It's about the fate of your country
trump, It's about the future of our great country
trump, No matter what label they use, a vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the American dream
trump, That's what it's about
trump, Look at Venezuela
trump, Venezuela, 15 years ago, was one of the wealthiest countries in the world and today, very sad
trump, No food, no water, no nothing
trump, Socialism
trump, We begin this campaign with the best record, the best results, the best agenda, and the only positive vision for America
trump, And it's not just a little bit positive
trump, Our country is going to be greater than it ever was
trump, That's where we're headed
trump, Together, we will help millions more citizens know the dignity of work, the pride of a paycheck and the satisfaction of a job really well done
trump, With your help, we will elect a Republican Congress to create a safe, modern, fair, and very lawful system of immigration
trump, And we're going to have a lot done anyway
trump, We already do have a lot done
trump, You saw the figures last week, but we're doing it the hard way
trump, It would be so much easier with a little stroke of the pen
trump, We will enact trade deals that ensure more products are proudly stamped with those beautiful, beautiful words, that incredible phrase, Made in the USA
trump, We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America within 10 years, and we've already started that program
trump, It will happen
trump, We have the medicine
trump, Nobody even knew that
trump, The AIDS epidemic in this country will be gone within 10 years
trump, We've already started the process
trump, It's been funded
trump, It's been funded
trump, Who would've thought that Honestly, when I ran, I didn't know that
trump, We have now the technology and what they've done with respect to AIDS is incredible
trump, What a terrible, terrible period of time the world went through, but we will have it ended within 10 years
trump, We will defeat the effort to drive up the cost of houses, cars, healthcare, light bulbs
trump, Right They took away our light bulb
trump, I want an incandescent light
trump, I want to look better, okay I want to pay less money to look better
trump, Does that make sense You pay much less money and you look much better and on top of that, with the new bulbs, if they break, it's considered a hazardous waste site
trump, It's all gases inside and you're supposed to bring it back to where you bought it in a sealed container
trump, Give me a break
trump, I asked the people, the professionals, Well, what do people do when it breaks Because they break all the time
trump, What do they do Nothing, they throw it away
trump, A lot of people didn't know
trump, They didn't understand
trump, You got a much better light at a much reduced cost and it's much safer because when those other bulbs break, they really are dangerous
trump, The gases come out, they're dangerous
trump, These are the little things that I have to explain
trump, Otherwise, people will say, What the hell are you doing with light bulbs for And we're trying to do the same thing with cars
trump, Cars have so much junk on them now to save a tiny little fraction of gasoline
trump, They have so much junk that they're less safe
trump, So, what I want to do is the following
trump, Under our rules and regulations, the cars are environmentally terrific, but they're safer and they're 3,500 less to buy, right And the reason they're safer is because they could be a little bit heavier
trump, Makes sense, right They could be a little bit heavier
trump, I mean, they make them now like paper mache
trump, Somebody touches them and the entire car collapses
trump, When somebody hits me, I want to be in as close to an army tank as possible
trump, No, they're made out of paper mache
trump, They weigh about three pounds and if you get hit by a bus, it's over
trump, They say, What happened to that car No, I think of it, it's safer and it's less expensive by 3,500 on average
trump, And California wants you to do the other cars and we don't
trump, We're going to end up in a big litigation and I'm fighting for you
trump, Look
trump, Look, it's not the kind of thing most presidents would be fighting for because they say, Let them pay more
trump, Let it be unsafe
trump, They listen to the environmentalists, and I'm an environmentalist
trump, I believe in the environment
trump, I want the cleanest water on the planet
trump, I want the cleanest air
trump, I want a lot of things
trump, You know, right now, we have the cleanest air that we've ever had in this country But what are they going to do about China and India and Russia and other countries that are spewing stuff What are we doing about them We're going to keep our nation clean
trump, But you know, the universe is so big that when you talk about China, the USA, India, you talk about these different places where a lot of bad stuff comes out, right It's so big that it's right next to each other
trump, It's right next to each other
trump, Does that make sense Right It's right next to each other
trump, So, what are they going to do We want to have the cleanest water and the cleanest air
trump, We will defend privacy
trump, We will defend free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and we will always defend your second amendment and we're doing it now
trump, And above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one America
trump, We support, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States
trump, We stand with our incredible heroes of law enforcement
trump, We believe in the dignity of work and in the sanctity of life
trump, We believe that mothers and fathers, not Washington bureaucrats, know best how to raise their strong, beautiful families in their loving and wonderful communities
trump, We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag
trump, And we will always live by the words of our national motto
trump, Nobody will ever take it down
trump, Nobody will ever take it down
trump, We will never allow them to take it down
trump, In God we trust
trump, We stand on the shoulders of American Patriots who built this country into the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth and we are going to be better than ever before and it won't even be close, and we're right there
trump, Our ancestors crossed the oceans, settled a continent, tamed the wilderness, revolutionized industry, pioneered sciences, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, put a man on the moon and built the most exceptional country in the history of the world
trump, And every day of my presidency, we will never forget that we are Americans and the future belongs to us
trump, The future belongs to each and every one of you
trump, Right With your help, your devotion and your drive…  Gee, it's too bad
trump, He did it right in the crescendo
trump, How do you top that I just readied the big beautiful crescendo and this character's going back home
trump, It's all right
trump, It's two people tonight
trump, Remember, when they say Massive protest at the Trump rally, two people
trump, With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working
trump, We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning in a win like never before
trump, We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God
trump, America is thriving like never before
trump, And ladies and gentlemen of the great state of New Mexico, we love you
trump, The best is yet to come
trump, Best is yet to come
trump, Thank you, New Mexico
trump, And together, we will make America wealthy again
trump, Very, very wealthy
trump, We will make America strong again
trump, We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again
trump, Thank you
trump, New Mexico
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you, New Mexico
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you
trump,
trump,Wow, that's a big crowd
trump, This is a big crowd
trump, Thank you very much, everybody
trump, Hello to Swanton and a load to Toledo
trump, I'm thrilled to be back in Ohio with thousands of hardworking, loyal, great American patriots … days from now
trump, Can you believe it, 43 days We go to again win Ohio
trump, I understand from Bob Paduchik, you know Bob That we're going to win it by more than we did
trump, Whether we win at nine, we won by nine points
trump, I just came into that big, beautiful place
trump, It's got more televisions in any plane in history
trump, They've got televisions and closets and bathrooms on the floor, on the ceilings
trump, I just saw that we're tied in Ohio
trump, I don't think so … President Trump may have a slim lead in Ohio They're not even campaigning in Ohio, come to think of it
trump, Now, they're fake polls
trump, They're almost as fake as the writers themselves
trump, They're all fake
trump, Remember last time they said, No, he's going to lose Ohio
trump, We won by nine points
trump, So, we had seven swing states last time
trump, President Trump is going to go home early, but it wasn't president at that time, it was just Donald Trump
trump, He will go home early
trump, We did
trump, That we went home early as victors, but we had nine states
trump, They had one of the crazy papers, New York Times
trump, They hired that guy
trump, They paid him millions because he never predicted wrong
trump, He was wrong
trump, I don't know if they had a contract where they could fire him, but they hired this guy
trump, We had nine states
trump, I was down at all of them on the day of election
trump, I was going to lose all nine, and then guess what I won every one of them
trump, Fake polls
trump, They're fake polls
trump, Then we have a crowd like this
trump, I don't know
trump, Look, the cameras, are you turning around These guys are bad people
trump, I swear
trump, They never turn the cameras around, ever
trump, Turn them around
trump, Turn them around
trump, They never tell, look at them
trump, It's just like a bunch of stiffs
trump, Real stiffs
trump, Why don't you turn the cameras around for once You look back there, you can't see it
trump, There's got to be, feels like Madison Square Garden on the ground except we have more people
trump, Oh boy, it's always tough
trump, You know, we go through this all the time
trump, We're always asking them, look at these crowds
trump, I mean, as far, you can't see it
trump, You have this prime territory, like you should be in the real estate business
trump, Now, as far as the eye can see back there, the cameras don't, they don't get it
trump, You only hear it from the sound
trump, I go home
trump, I say to the first lady, Did you see that crowd we had tonight in Ohio She goes, No, no
trump, They just keep it on your face
trump, That includes Fox
trump, They just keep it here, right here
trump, They don't want to show
trump, You know what they don't know and what they don't get is that showing this kind of activity is a good thing for them
trump, It's positive for their ratings
trump, It's really a good thing, but they don't want to do it, but I give up on it
trump, You know what you do You hear it because you can't have … You know when sleepy Joe Biden, he's got the circles
trump, You knowthose big circles You know why he has the circles He's got four of them, because they can't … I mean, think of it
trump, He is a guy who's failed every time he ran
trump, We called him 1 Joe and now he's shot and he got their nomination
trump, How the hell does that work out How does that work out But he's got the circles
trump, He got like four, sometimes he has six because that's a good way of saying, if you don't have any people, just put them in the circle and he's practicing the science
trump, Now it doesn't work out, but we're going to win four more years in the White House
trump, We're doing things that nobody's ever done before
trump, We're doing what nobody's ever done, and thank you for being here
trump, I wish we could move the press back further, if you want to know the truth
trump, As our nation mourns the loss of Supreme Court Justice … Thank you everybody
trump, Thank you
trump, So is our nation mourns the loss of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, I will soon announce a nominee for the United States Supreme Court
trump, They say it's the most important thing a president can do
trump, I don't know
trump, I think military, maybe
trump, We rebuilt your military two and a half trillion dollars
trump, Great
trump, We will fill that seat
trump, It's going to go quickly
trump, Probably announced the person
trump, I don't want to make the men too angry
trump, It will be a woman
trump, Is that okay I don't want to have a problem with men
trump, They'll say Trump is doing very poorly with men
trump, You listen
trump, How's he doing Well, he's doing very poorly with men, with women
trump, He's doing very poorly with the black community, Hispanic community
trump, Then you have the election night doing very poorly with those with diploma, without diploma, college, PhDs
trump, What's he doing well Oh no, it's going to be a very short night
trump, Then they say Donald Trump is the projected winner by a lot
trump, They say, well, what happened is he did very well with women did very well with men, diplomas
trump, He did well with African American community
trump, By the way, we are doing really well with the African American community, with the Hispanic community
trump, We're doing well with women
trump, We're doing very well
trump, We're doing well with suburbia, suburbia
trump, I ended a regulation that will destroy suburbia
trump, If Biden got in, they will destroy the suburbia
trump, We call it suburbia of the world and we love it
trump, I know it well, Westchester County, the suburban, they sometimes, if you say suburban housewife, you're in deep trouble
trump, So what you do is you say suburban women, they love me
trump, You know why They want security and they don't want projects being right next to their house
trump, That's okay
trump, They don't want it
trump, By the way, that includes minorities
trump, Because 29 to 30 of these suburban communities are minorities
trump, That includes them
trump, They don't want that
trump, They want safe communities
trump, They want great communities
trump, They don't want to lose the American dream
trump, It's very simple
trump, I got rid of the regulation from Obama- Biden that was destroying suburbia
trump, Okay Destroying it
trump, I think suburbia has got to wake up because if they get in, you know who's in charge You know who's in charge of the program Cory Booker, Cory Booker
trump, Cory Booker
trump, So, I think the suburban women and suburban men and husbands and wives and everybody, you better get smart because you're not going to have your dream very much longer if they get in
trump, If I get in, you've got it
trump, You've also got your second amendment if I get it
trump, In 2018, we expanded the Senate majority
trump, Remember, they said, first of all, I wasn't running
trump, I wasn't running
trump, It makes a difference
trump, Wait you see what happens
trump, We're going to take back the house
trump, We're going to get rid of this crazy Nancy Pelosi
trump, Kevin McCarthy's done a great job
trump, We're going to take back the house
trump, People are so tired of her
trump, People are so tired
trump, Did you hear today The latest
trump, So, they impeached me for perfect phone call
trump, Perfect
trump, It was a perfect phone call
trump, Now they want to impeach me again if I nominate somebody as I'm constitutionally obligated to do, to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States
trump, Go ahead and I want them to do that
trump, I want them to do that
trump, We will
trump, We will
trump, We will
trump, If he puts forth a highly qualified candidate, we will impeach him
trump, Well, I said, Well, I'm the only guy in the world that could get impeached for trying to fill a seat in the Supreme
trump, So, we're going to put up our nominee who's going to be outstanding
trump, We're looking at five incredible jurists, five incredible people, women that are extraordinary in every way
trump, I mean, honestly, it could be anyone
trump, I mean, we're going to be announcing it on Friday or Saturday
trump, Again, they say it's the most important thing and think of it
trump, So in a single term, single term, by the end of our term, we will have nominated and had confirmed I think it'll end up being over 300 federal judges and hopefully three Supreme Court justices
trump, Think of that
trump, Three
trump, Some presidents, they never get any
trump, They last a long time, a lot of presidents get none
trump, We've had three
trump, It's blowing their minds
trump, It's blowing their minds, but for the people of Ohio, this is what you want
trump, So, it looks like we're going to have three and it's going to be very exciting
trump, It's exciting even from me
trump, I'm going to look forward to it
trump, Probably Saturday, we will announce the nominee and it's somebody that you're going to have great respect for, great respect
trump, Thank you
trump, Big stuff
trump, That's a big thing
trump, They set the course of our country for many years to come, whether it's on life or the second amendment or so many other things, they set the whole course of the country
trump, Very important position, the most important
trump, Joe Biden has refused to list the names of his potential justices because he knows they're too extreme to withstand any form of public review
trump, If Joe Biden and the Democrats take power, they will pack the Supreme Court with far left radicals who will unilaterally transform American society far beyond recognition
trump, They will mutilate the largest figure the constitution and oppose a socialist vision from the bench that could never pass at the ballot box
trump, So, they don't want to show the judges because the only ones that he can put in are far left radicals
trump, If he does something even towards left of center, which would be acceptable, I guess, we have no choice
trump, If he did that, he would lose the left
trump, So, he's going to have to put in radicals
trump, So he doesn't want to show who his judges are
trump, I've shown a list, I have a double list, about 45 from which I will only pick, but he doesn't want to do that, because if you found out who he was going to pick, he would be unelectable
trump, Hopefully, he's going to be unelectable anyway
trump, We're going to find out
trump, So, he wouldn't be able to survive a Joe Biden
trump, You wouldn't be able to survive
trump, We've been calling it socialism
trump, I don't think it's socialism
trump, I think it's a step beyond what they're talking about
trump, You look at Portland, you look at Chicago, you look at New York, you look at Baltimore and Oakland
trump, These are Democrat run cities that are horrible in crime
trump, There's no law and order, no cash bail, no anything
trump, You know what The Republican cities are running great
trump, They're running great
trump, So, we're going to get it all changed around
trump, We went into Minneapolis, we solved the problem like you wouldn't believe
trump, What did it take You saw it
trump, What did that take I would say probably 30 minutes
trump, Right They should have called us in about seven days earlier
trump, How about the reporter He gets up there, behind him is a burning city
trump, I never saw anything like it
trump, He's saying, There are really no protests here
trump, This is very friendly
trump, We call this a friendly protester because you're not supposed to have political rallies
trump, You're not supposed to have anything
trump, The only thing you can have is thousands of people running down a street burning stores, looting, doing what … That's okay, because that's protesting, but we'll call this a friendly protest, but your children will be robbed of their future and the damage will endure for generations to come- … future the damage we'll endure for generations to come
trump, We have to win
trump, This is the most important election in the history of our country in my opinion
trump, And a lot of that's got to do with the fact that we're going to have one extra, but we didn't think this was going to happen
trump, But I used to say just a week ago, We're going to have one, two, three, four, and maybe even five, the next President, and the Supreme Court is going to be a tremendous factor
trump, A lot of people said that's the reason I won so easily in the Electoral College last time
trump, 306, 306 to 223
trump, He will not get to 270
trump, Remember He will not get to 270
trump, This will be a short evening for Donald Trump
trump, Oh, good riddance
trump, Thank God we got rid of him
trump, Oh, this is going to be great
trump, And then that problem happened
trump, Ladies and gentlemen, Donald Trump has won the state of Ohio
trump, Remember the one, she was crying She was crying
trump, Donald Trump has won Ohio
trump, But it wasn't winning Ohio, it was by the margin
trump, Where the hell he said, Where did this margin come from They opened the polls
trump, Then they closed the polls
trump, Normally you have to wait hours, unless it's a total runaway
trump, And they said, Ah, the polls and the doors are closed in Ohio
trump, Donald Trump has won
trump, And they go, Oh my God
trump, But wait a minute
trump, He won by nine points
trump, What the hell's going on over here Then they said, Donald Trump has won the state of Florida
trump, Donald Trump has won the state of Georgia
trump, Donald Trump has won North Carolina, South Carolina
trump, Remember that Was that the most exciting evening, really Remember And it's not Donald Trump
trump, It's you
trump, It's all of us
trump, They use the name Donald Trump
trump, It's all of us have won
trump, And this one's going to be even better because nobody has done, and then don't even challenge it, the fake news, nobody has done in three and a half years what we've done
trump, We've rebuilt our military
trump, Two and a half trillion dollars
trump, We've taken care of our vets
trump, We have choice, we have accountability
trump, We can fire people now when they're not treating our vets right
trump, We couldn't do that before
trump, They could treat our vets terribly
trump, We have accountability
trump, Nobody has done what we've done for our vets
trump, 91 approval rating at the VA
trump, 91, the highest ever
trump, So nobody's done it, and that's why I think this is going to be the most important of all
trump, I used to say, Well, I don't know
trump, How does it compare to 2016 I just gave that up
trump, This is the most important election
trump, You know why Two reasons
trump, Number one, that's over with, the hell with it
trump, The hell with it
trump, But the truth is it's got a seat in, and we have a lot of new things including additional, substantial, middle income tax cuts and other tax cuts, and tremendous regulation cuts
trump, And we're finishing up with our military
trump, We're building Space Force
trump, The wall is going incredibly
trump, You remember the wall They don't talk about the wall anymore, the fake news
trump, Once we started building it, if you think that was easy to build the wall, we had an entire party that would die for the fact, and I made a terrible mistake in the wall, instead of telling you, We're going to build a wall, we're going to build a wall, the Democrats formed, it was very tough, but I got it
trump, I'm a real estate developer
trump, You can always get money
trump, You learn we have a lot of little pockets
trump, We had a lot of big pockets
trump, But the military was great
trump, The Army Corps of Engineers were great
trump, So we're up to 330 miles of wall
trump, We're doing 10 miles a week, and we're going to be finished with the wall very soon
trump, And it's exactly the wall, the little more expensive wall, they want like nice, expensive, but exactly what border patrol wanted
trump, We're building them the exact wall that they want
trump, We can't give them any excuses
trump, We can't give them any excuses
trump, But it's true, they used to talk about the wall all the time because they never thought I'd be able to get a bill
trump, Once I got it going, got it built, I got the financing, we won a lot of lawsuits, by the way, we won a lot of lawsuits
trump, They sued us
trump, Pelosi was suing us
trump, Congress was suing us
trump, The Senate was suing us
trump, We won a lot of lawsuits
trump, Once it was obvious that we won and we started building, they never talk about the wall anymore
trump, And I made a terrible, terrible mistake because I had to work my ass off to get that thing built
trump, You have no idea
trump, You have no idea
trump, You have no idea
trump, But I should have said, the mistake, I should have said when I talked to these big crowds, and the crowds are getting bigger, there's more enthusiasm now than we ever had four years ago, but I should have said, instead of, We will build a wall, I kept, We will build a wall, place would go crazy, I should have said, We will not build the wall
trump, Under no circumstances, will we build a wall, the Democrats would have given us all the money we wanted
trump, It's true
trump, It's true
trump, And then they would have said, See, he didn't keep his campaign promise
trump, These people are sick
trump, The Biden nominated justices will shred our Second Amendment, eliminate the right to self defense, and allow the government to confiscate your privately owned firearms
trump, You know that
trump, Put in other language, they will end your Second Amendment
trump, And they will do that
trump, By the way, if I wasn't here, you wouldn't have a Second Amendment right now
trump, That would be gone
trump, I hate to say it
trump, I'm the only thing standing between you and chaos, I'm telling you
trump, And Second Amendment and all of the other things
trump, Biden's justices will remove the words under God from the Pledge of Allegiance
trump, Did you see that Did you see it They said, No, we'd never remove
trump, And I saw it, they're doing the Pledge of Allegiance
trump, And I said, Oh, it must be a typo
trump, They left the words under God out of the Pledge of Allegiance, the Democrats
trump, And I said, Oh, there's a typo
trump, Typo, they made a mistake
trump, What a stupid mistake
trump, Can you believe it That guy's in big trouble
trump, What a stupid mistake
trump, And then I heard it a second time
trump, They did the same mistake
trump, That's what they're doing
trump, They're going to take God out of everything just like they want to knock down the statue of George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson
trump, That's never happening
trump, It's never happening
trump, A lot of these Democrats states, you see it, the churches are closed
trump, They don't want our churches to open
trump, You can have a riot where you kill people in the streets
trump, 25,000 people don't have to wear a mask, nothing
trump, They can march down the streets, step on each other's face, they can do whatever the hell they want, that's okay
trump, But you can't go to church
trump, They have ideas, they have plans, and it's never happening with me as your President
trump, That I can tell you
trump, And you see it, they want to tear down crosses from public spaces
trump, You see it
trump, Since I signed a little law, they were ripping down a lot of statues about four months ago, and I said, Do we have any laws, like old laws when they was strong, when we were smart, when we were tough Sir, we have one, sir
trump, A General came in
trump, What's the law, General Sir, there was a law from quite a while ago, 10 years in prison
trump, They didn't use the word jail, prison
trump, Prison's a tougher word
trump, I said, What do you mean, 10 years You get 10 years in prison if you knock down a statue or if you knock down a monument
trump, I said, General, let me see that sucker, please
trump, Bring that to my office
trump, And we revived it because you can't get that approved by Congress
trump, They would never
trump, Today in Congress, you'd do it, they'll give you half a day in a hotel someplace
trump, So 10 years
trump, So they were having a big march on Washington in two days and I signed this new law
trump, We updated it, and it was 10 years
trump, You get 10 years in prison
trump, You touch, you knock down a monument
trump, And there's no games
trump, This is the old days
trump, This is the days when we had strong laws, when we had real laws, when we had real politicians that knew how to make laws
trump, So here's the thing
trump, So they weren't going to come in, they were actually looking to knock down the statue of a man named Thomas Jefferson
trump, That's not too good
trump, They had obliterated a lot of different things
trump, And so I had a news conference
trump, I announced that I'm signing a law that anybody that knocks down a monument or a statue gets 10 years in jail
trump, And the police in Washington, and we had National Guard, we had Secret Service
trump, We were all ready for them
trump, We were ready for them
trump, And the time came, there's was only a problem, nobody showed up
trump, You know why 10 years was too much
trump, 10 years was too much
trump, It's amazing the way
trump, Isn't it amazing the way it all works So instead they burned down Portland
trump, I speak to the Governor
trump, The mayor is hopeless
trump, He's a hopeless, poor guy
trump, They chased him out of his apartment, and he still thinks they're wonderful people
trump, They're burning down his city
trump, But I want to go in there with the National Guard so bad
trump, It would take us 15 minutes to solve the problem
trump, When they heard in Seattle that we were going in, we were going in the next day, the guys just walked away
trump, They left
trump, That was the end of it
trump, We had nothing to do
trump, But they want to ban all prayer in public schools and require taxpayers to fund extreme late term abortion
trump, Biden's justices will erase national borders, they don't want borders, protect sanctuary cities, and compel the unlimited entry of foreign nationals
trump, And if you look at some of these jihadist nations, no thank you
trump, Somebody said, That's not nice
trump, That's not politically correct
trump, I said, That's okay
trump, They'll clip all the police departments, free violent criminals, shield foreign terrorists, and declare the death penalty unconstitutional, even for the most depraved mass murderers who kill women and children
trump, That's what they want
trump, They don't want any death penalty
trump, Not for the Boston Bomber, not for anybody
trump, You see the Boston Bomber, they're still trying this guy, what he did to so many lives
trump, He killed people, ruined so many families, ruined so many lives
trump, And by the way, they want the Boston Bomber to be able to vote
trump, You know that
trump, In three and a half years under my administration, we've secured America's borders, rebuilt the awesome power of the United States military, obliterated the ISIS caliphate 100, fixed our disastrous trade deals, and brought jobs and factories back to the great state of Ohio
trump, I love Ohio
trump, I love Ohio
trump, I don't know what it is
trump, I was told by Bob and some of the Congressmen that are here, we have some great ones, I'm going to introduce them in a second, but I was told that they're not even trying for Ohio
trump, You know why Because I love you and you love me, and that's the way it is
trump, That's the way it is
trump, Thank you
trump, I love you too
trump, It's very interesting
trump, So somebody in the fake news media did a story yesterday because there's crazy chances going on
trump, They have too about the seat and all that
trump, But there was another chant that's happening at all these rallies
trump, We're having massive rallies
trump, We're in Minnesota
trump, We had a tremendous crowd
trump, Wisconsin, tremendous
trump, Pennsylvania, every one of them
trump, I mean, in all fairness, it's like this, everyone
trump, But this rant is going on like it's crazy
trump, And it's, We love you
trump, We love you
trump, We love you, and you know what I don't want to say it
trump, I'm just saying, they have not been able to find in the history of politics in this nation, even we loved Ronald Reagan, but they have not been able to find where people broke out and said, We love you, about, I guess I have to call myself a politician
trump, I don't feel like a politician
trump, How nice is that I never heard it
trump, I've been to a lot of different speeches and rallies
trump, I've never heard crowds go, We love you
trump, But you know why We love you
trump, I love you
trump, But you know why Because, again, nobody has done what we've done
trump, Ohio had the best year in its history last year
trump, We had a great year
trump, And next year, assuming we win, which I hope we're going to win, but if we win, you're going to have a year next year
trump, First of all, take a look at the third quarter
trump, It's going to be announced the numbers just before the election
trump, They'll come out three days before the election
trump, And I'll tell you what, I'll bet on the numbers, even though Crazy Nancy and these people don't want to give any stimulus, they don't want to give anything
trump, They want to keep a lot of states closed wherever they can
trump, You know what they're going to do They're going to announce they're going to be opening on November 4th
trump, There'll be open
trump, All these closed states, they're going to be open on November 4th
trump, One of them blue and a teacher's union
trump, Did you see it No, we don't want to open now
trump, We don't want to open
trump, The pandemic
trump, We don't want to
trump, We're rounding the turn on the pandemic
trump, Vaccines are coming soon
trump, But we don't want to open
trump, Around November 4th we're going to open
trump, This person that's a judge of a union said that
trump, That was not good
trump, I think they'll get rid of her quickly
trump, I'm also proud that we have successfully brought back the Big 10 and the Ohio State Buckeyes
trump, You better have a good year after all of that
trump, You have a good team, right Good coach
trump, Good team
trump, Good everything
trump, You have a good team
trump, You always have a good team
trump, But there was a case, what do I know I said, How's it going Everything good Are you struggling They said, Sir, Sleepy Joe Biden did an ad that you, me, that you closed football
trump, I said, What do you mean I closed I didn't close
trump, The guy did an ad
trump, It's called disinformation
trump, It's called the opposite of what the fact is
trump, Not only didn't I close it, I didn't think about it too much, okay The states should all be open
trump, But I heard about Big 10 football, and because of this ad, I said, Hey, wait a minute
trump, I have an idea
trump, It was a fake ad, just like the ad on the grave sites, and that allows me to say that this man is a gross incompetent
trump, He has no idea
trump, Because now, see, I would never talk like that, but when I saw that horrible thing, and nobody's done more for the military than I have, when I saw that horrible ad, An anonymous source has said that Donald Trump said this, I have 28 people now that have come forward saying it's a total lie, they don't care, so they did an ad, once they did that, I said, Well, now the gloves are off
trump, Let's face it, Joe Biden is incompetent
trump, He always was even in prime time
trump, he was incompetent in prime time
trump, And now he's really incompetent
trump, But because of the ad, I said, It's very interesting, that ad, it's very interesting
trump, Let me call up the Commissioner
trump, I had called up the Commissioner, very good guy, and I said, Commissioner, what can we do to get Big 10 football back Well, I don't know
trump, And we started a little thing, the Commissioner and myself, one of my guys, he's fantastic, and within a few days, it started getting talked about, and then we kept it going and we helped him with some testing because we have the greatest testing in the world
trump, We get no credit for it
trump, We've tested almost 100 million people
trump, India is second with 38th and they have 1
trump,5 billion people, slightly more than you
trump, But I will tell you, so all of a sudden they have schools
trump, Then looked like it was going to open without Michigan and without a couple of states
trump, And then all of a sudden the pressure became so great, and the full league is opening now and it's going to be very exciting
trump, And I will tell you, it's not a question of taking credit, but truly we were the ones that did that
trump, I mean, it was
trump, I'll tell you when I do it and when I don't
trump, But it was closed, it was gone, it was announced that it was closed
trump, And what really spurred me on was when Sleepy Joe announced that I was the one that did it
trump, I said, I didn't even know it was closed
trump, But once I found out it was, I called the Commissioner
trump, He was really good, I tell you
trump, And we called a couple of the top people at the universities and they got it going
trump, It looked like we had seven schools, eight schools
trump, All of a sudden, everybody fell into line
trump, I think they're all open now
trump, Every one of them is participating
trump, So I want to thank the Commissioner
trump, I want to thank all of those schools
trump, May the best team win
trump, In other words, Ohio State
trump, That's a good team
trump, You know who the best proponents were The players and especially the parents of the players
trump, These kids have a short window to get into the NFL to create some excitement and how good they are
trump, And you have a lot of potential players, but they couldn't play football
trump, And they said, We're safer on the field than we are staying at home, and they meant it
trump, And we did something and I'm happy about it
trump, So enjoy the football, enjoy it
trump, Under 16 years of Presidents Obama and Bush, median household income rose only 2,945
trump, So remember that
trump, That's 16 years, 2009, so let's say 3000
trump, Under three years of President Trump, it rose almost 7,000
trump, So think of that, 16 years
trump, Three years, achieving the highest median income in the history of our country
trump, In my first three years, we lifted 6
trump,6 million people out of poverty, the largest poverty reduction of any President in the history of our country
trump, We built the greatest economy in the history of the world and we are doing it again
trump, We're building it again
trump, I see the signs Make America Great Again, so I say this, it's called now Make America Great Again
trump, Again
trump, Because we did it and then we had to close it up
trump, We saved millions of lives
trump, If we didn't do that, you would have had three million people
trump, It would have been terrible
trump, It's terrible anyway
trump, They shouldn't have allowed it to happen, China
trump, To defeat the China Virus, we launched the largest mobilization since World War Two
trump, Through pioneering therapies, we reduced the fatality rate- Through pioneering therapies, we reduced the fatality rate 85 since April
trump, Think of that
trump, That's remdesivir and all of the things, the plasma, all different things
trump, Where do you see what's coming out Europe is almost 30 greater excess mortality rate than the United States
trump, That's before today's big breakout
trump, You know they had a big breakout in Europe and they keep saying in the fake news, they keep saying about, Oh, Europe, Europe, Europe
trump, Well, we're doing better than Europe
trump, I hate to see what happened, and it had a big impact on the market today because it was a bad thing
trump, But they had a big hit and they'll take care of it
trump, They know how to do it
trump, They'll take care of it
trump, We're working very closely with Europe and other countries, including on the vaccine
trump, We have three vaccines right now that are right there
trump, They're right at the starting gate and they're going to be fantastic
trump, So it's good
trump, With Biden, if you had that regime, you'd be three years away because it would have never gotten out of the FDA
trump, What we've done in a very safe manner is amazing
trump, Now remember this, Biden was in charge of the swine flu, right It's called the H1N1
trump, Remember he calls it the N1H1
trump, I said, No, no, no, no
trump, H comes before the N
trump, It's so easy
trump, But he goes, The N1H1
trump, We say, No
trump, But it's the swine flu
trump, Maybe we just call it the swine flu
trump, He did such a gross, horrible job on that
trump, His own man who was in charge of it said they didn't have a clue
trump, They didn't know what they were doing
trump, It was a much less lethal disease and they lost many, many people
trump, Many, many people
trump, It was totally incompetently
trump, And now I got this guy standing up
trump, Well, we're giving him advice
trump, His own guy that ran it
trump, Did everybody see this They're saying they didn't have a clue what they were doing
trump, It was so bad
trump, I don't know why the hell he said it, to be honest with you
trump, Who would say that Maybe because he was honest
trump, Does that make sense Now Biden gets up and he's saying to do the same things as we've already done
trump, He basically took our plan and he said, This is what you should do
trump, But we have among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country in the world and the fastest economic recovery by far of any Western nation by far
trump, Our bold and early action saved millions of lives and our decisive economic response saved tens of millions of jobs, including 1
trump,9 million jobs in the state of Ohio
trump, You know that He knows it
trump, He's got one of them
trump, He's got one of them
trump, Through operation warp speed, we're developing these great vaccines
trump, And that's going to be… Literally, these will be done in record time
trump, Like nobody's ever done it before
trump, On November 3rd, Ohio will decide whether we end the pandemic and return to record prosperity or whether we allow sleepy Joe Biden and his group of incompetence to delay the vaccine, shut down the country
trump, He actually suggested that he would shut down the country
trump, We now know the disease
trump, We didn't know it
trump, Now we know it affects elderly people with heart problems and other problems
trump, If they have other problems, that's what it really affects
trump, That's it
trump, You know, in some States, thousands of people, nobody young below the age of 18, like nobody
trump, They have a strong immune system
trump, Who knows Take your hat off to the young because they have a hell of an immune system, but it affects virtually nobody
trump, It's an amazing thing
trump, By the way, open your schools
trump, Everybody open your schools
trump, Sleepy Joe Biden wants to impose a 4 trillion tax site, ban American energy, destroy the suburbs, give free healthcare to illegal aliens
trump, How about that one You know the bad part about that We all have heart
trump, We want to take care of people
trump, Probably that is everybody's going to come to the United States
trump, People that weren't even thinking about it, they're going to say, Oh man, these idiots are giving free healthcare, free college education
trump, They're giving free everything
trump, They're giving a Rolls Royce to every family that enters through the Southern border
trump, Remember I said that jokingly and CNN said, He misrepresented
trump, They are not getting a Rolls Royce
trump, I agree
trump, Now they're sick
trump, They are sick
trump, And indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-American lies
trump, They're doing that
trump, We're stopping it
trump, To combat the toxic left-wing propaganda in our schools, I announced last week that we're launching a pro-American lesson plan for students called 1776 Commission
trump, We will teach our children the truth about America, that we are the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth and we are getting better and better all the time
trump, We got to
trump, No party can lead America that will not teach our children to love America
trump, Biden's running mate, Kamilla
trump, Who likes Kamilla Does anybody like her She was the most failed candidate
trump, I mean, she started off good
trump, And every week she went down, down 15 points, 12 points, 11 points, 9 points, six points, five points, four points, two points
trump, Didn't she leave at about two or one She was heading down to the basement
trump, She was so mean to him
trump, I felt sorry for him
trump, No, I did
trump, I felt sorry
trump, So she called them everything from a racist to a MeTooer
trump, He was MeToo
trump, He was a part of the MeToo generation
trump, What she called him, what she said
trump, So I brilliantly said, Well, he can't pick Pocahontas because she was too nasty
trump, How nasty was she to Bloomberg Was she unbelievable Boy, he was standing there
trump, What happened What happened No, actually
trump, What happened Mini Mike
trump, He's another beauty
trump, He's a real beauty
trump, Mini Mike, what happened What the hell happened He hit her so hard
trump, Remember She hits him with about 30 different things, and I'm not talking about our president
trump, He thought she was talking about me
trump, Can you believe it And I'm not talking
trump, I'm talking about you
trump, He said, Get me out of here
trump, Get me out of here
trump, And now he wants to buy his way back into the Democrat party
trump, He wants to buy his way back into the Democrats
trump, He hasn't taken enough abuse
trump, If I were him, I'd sort of either ride it out or stay with the good Trump economy and get even richer
trump, Biden's running made even urged supporters to help the bail riders out of jail
trump, You saw that Including one who attempted to murder a police officer and a man accused of sexually assaulting an eight year old child
trump, Now they're trying to free them on bail
trump, They're putting up the money to get them out by this plan to appease the domestic terrorist
trump, And that's what it is
trump, My plan is to arrest the domestic terrorist, and that's what we're doing for many people in jail
trump, Many people
trump, Remember what I told you about the monuments This is remembrance
trump, Isn't it beautiful We don't see that anymore
trump, Have you seen a monument knocked down recently No, we don't see it anymore
trump, I don't know
trump, We want to rip down Abraham Lincoln
trump, It got to Lincoln
trump, First, it was not too many people heard of him
trump, Confederate soldiers, et cetera
trump, You say, Hey, look, do it through a process
trump, But they started hitting Lincoln
trump, Then they hit Gandhi
trump, Now Gandhi was about peace
trump, Gandhi just wanted peace
trump, Leave me alone
trump, Peace, peace, peace
trump, Let's rip them down
trump, They're sick people
trump, The Democrat party's war on cops has already led to a surge in vicious murders in Democrat control cities costing countless black lives
trump, If Biden and the left gain power, they will dismantle police departments nationwide
trump, I'll tell you, the community that's most hurt, most hurt by what they're doing and there is the black community, the Hispanic community
trump, And we're doing great in the polls with the black community and the Hispanic community
trump, And the Asian community
trump, We're doing great
trump, In fact, we did so well last night on one poll, they said it must be a typo
trump, They did
trump, It must be an error
trump, It wasn't
trump, It's no error
trump, You're going to find out on November 3rd it's no error
trump, As president, I always stand and I will always stand with the men and women of law enforcement
trump, They're great people
trump, They're very brave people
trump, Not easy, and they don't get support
trump, We have to give them back their dignity
trump, We have to let them do their job
trump, That's very simple
trump, They're great
trump, We're joined tonight by two high school football players
trump, They became very, very famous
trump, They became more famous than President Trump
trump, They were beautiful
trump, I watched them running through the crowds with those flags
trump, Here's some place, I don't know, you got a lot of people here
trump, We're going to try and figure it out
trump, Hold up your flag

trump, When I thought we had to be down, we lost a lot of the top, top support
trump, The head of the Republican party, little things like that
trump, I said, We don't have a head of the Republican party
trump, He left because you had a terrible governor in this state
trump, Terrible
trump, Your previous governor was terrible
trump, He was terrible

trump, I said, You got to be kidding
trump, But we did
trump, So much evolves around Ohio and it's just a state that we have a relationship with
trump, It's a great state
trump, We've done a great job for you and you've done a great job for us
trump, So we appreciate it very much
trump, Thank you
trump, Together, we've spent the last four years reversing the damage done by the Democrats and Joe Biden over a 47 year period
trump, Think of it
trump, He's always talking about, You should have done this
trump, You should have done that
trump, He really just left office
trump, It's not that long ago, right He's been there for years and years and now he should have done
trump, He's never going to do anything
trump, He's never going to do anything
trump, Guy is a stone cold loser
trump, Biden supported every globalist sellout of Ohio workers for over a half a century, including NAFTA, China's entry into the World Trade Organization, the disaster known as TPP and how about the Paris Climate Accord That's another beauty
trump, I'll tell you, that was designed to hurt our country
trump, You would have lost trillions of dollars, closed your factories all over the place
trump, In the meantime, China didn't kick in for another 10 years
trump, The whole thing was a rigged deal
trump, I tell you, I said, I'm going to get killed for this one, but we're going to terminate
trump, And you know what The people got it right away
trump, Everybody understood
trump, That was another rip off of our country
trump, This state lost one in three manufacturing jobs after the NAFTA and China disasters
trump, Joe Biden is a shameless phony who pretends… He doesn't have a clue
trump, What the hell We're talking like he knows
trump, He's got guys around him that are pretty smart
trump, They're radical left
trump, He's going to do whatever they tell him to do
trump, He pretends to care about blue collar workers
trump, After spending more than five decades in Washington, he tells me, Why didn't you do this Why didn't you do that You see these fake commercials
trump, Why didn't you do it I said, I've only been here three and a half years
trump, This guy has been here for 47 years
trump, He didn't do anything
trump, My actions saved countless jobs across Ohio and here in Toledo, the home of the Jeep, right The home of the Jeep
trump, That's good
trump, That's a great brand
trump, They've done a great job with Jeep
trump, Jeep
trump, Everyone loves Jeep
trump, Earlier this year, I kept my promise to Ohio when we ended the NAFTA nightmare
trump, I proudly signed the brand new US-Mexico-Canada agreement in July
trump, That's a big difference
trump, Like day and night
trump, It's working out great too
trump, It's working out great
trump, You know how I know that it's a good deal for us Because they don't like it
trump, I took the toughest ever action to stand up to China's rampant theft of Ohio jobs
trump, We achieved American energy
trump, We passed record tax cuts and regulations
trump, Our energy independence is incredible
trump, We have now energy independence
trump, We don't have to be in these far away lands anymore
trump, Now we'll be there to help certain allies that have been great, but we don't have to be
trump, Since my election, natural gas production in Ohio has surged 63
trump, They want to close it up
trump, By the way, you do know they want to close it up
trump, They want to close up all fracking natural gas ever
trump, They want to close it up
trump, This would kill at least 700,000 Ohio jobs
trump, Probably more than a million
trump, While I'm president, America will remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas and Ohio workers will continue leading the way
trump, I just left the great state of Texas, and I talked to a lot of people like this, a great crowd of people
trump, We have tremendous support all over the country
trump, I'll tell you what
trump, These people are great
trump, And here's the platform that they have
trump, Sleepy Joe Biden
trump, No oil, no religion, no God, and no guns
trump, Now I'm in Texas
trump, It's a really rough thing in Ohio, but now we're talking Texas
trump, No oil, that doesn't work well in Texas, right No guns
trump, That doesn't work well in Texas
trump, No God
trump, Look what they're doing to the churches and everything
trump, That doesn't work
trump, No God
trump, No religion
trump, That doesn't work well
trump, You would have to be George Washington with your running mate would be Abraham Lincoln
trump, Okay
trump, Your VP candidate
trump, And you'd still lose very big
trump, And then they say- … and you'd still lose very big
trump, And then they say, Yeah, he's doing okay
trump, He's two up in Texas
trump, They said it last time too, that Texas is even, four years ago
trump, And everybody said, No, I think Trump is killing it
trump, We'd have stadiums with 25,000, 30,000 people, much more that couldn't get in
trump, We'd have 40,000, 50,000 people outside and they'd say I was even
trump, We won in a landslide, just like we won this state, in a landslide
trump, You know the expression they use, Texas is in play
trump, You know what in play means It could go either way
trump, And guys would get on there and say, I don't think so
trump, And then that night again, The polls in Texas have closed
trump, Donald Trump has won the great state of Texas
trump, I mean, the whole thing is crazy
trump, It's crazy, it's crazy
trump, You know what they do It's suppression polls
trump, They try and depress you
trump, They try and make you unhappy so you go out to dinner with your wife, your husband, you go out to dinner, Darling, let's have dinner
trump, It's so sad
trump, We love Donald, but he just can't make it
trump, He can't make it
trump, Let's go out, have dinner
trump, We'll come home and watch the results
trump, Except 2016 came and nobody did that, they all went out and voted and we kicked ass
trump, Tell me, was that the most exciting evening in the history of television Did you ever see the ratings, the combined ratings I think the biggest ever
trump, But was that the most exciting 2016, was that the most exciting evening in the history of television We invested 2
trump,5 trillion in the U
trump,S
trump, military, including more than 6 billion in contracts
trump, I'll tell you what, you like the word pronounced Lima or Lima, because I saved Lima
trump, And I tell you what, I saved Lima
trump, I came here and they were going to close that plant in Lima
trump, They were going to close the tank plant
trump, It was done
trump, And I said, Why are we closing a tank plant And I got a couple of calls from my friends, the Congressman right here
trump, And I got calls
trump, And Jim Jordan called me
trump, Do you like Jim Jordan He's great
trump, And I looked at this army tank plant in Lima
trump, I said, Why are we closing it And I saw the people building the tanks and the technology's incredible
trump, And if you ever closed it, you'd never be able to open a thing like that again
trump, So I overrode the generals, I overrode everybody, and now we're making a record number of tanks in that plant and it's absolutely thriving
trump, But we had tremendous success
trump, We took 100 of the ISIS caliphate and we killed the founder and leader of ISIS, Al-Baghdadi
trump, We took out the world's number one terrorist and the mass murder of American troops and many other people
trump, Qasem Soleimani is dead
trump, He's dead
trump, I withdrew from last administration's disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal
trump, They paid 150 billion, plus 1
trump,8 billion in cash
trump, You know they got Nothing
trump, They got nothing
trump, I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem
trump, Every president for many, many decades said they were going to do it
trump, They never did it
trump, They never did it
trump, They didn't have the guts to do it
trump, They campaigned on it, they were all going to do it
trump, Then they got there, there was a lot of pressure put on them
trump, A lot of pressure put on me
trump, Every leader was calling all over
trump, Please don't do it
trump, Please don't do it
trump, Mr
trump, President, please don't do it
trump, Don't do it
trump, Don't move it
trump, Just leave it the way it is
trump, It's okay
trump, But I promised and I said, I'm going to do it
trump, And then I got calls from the biggest people in the world
trump, Kings, I got calls from presidents, from prime ministers, Please, please don't tell it
trump, Then I got calls, Please have him call me back me, me
trump, I said, Look, tell everybody I'm out for three days
trump, I'm not going to be able to call them back
trump, I had a news conference, we announced it
trump, Then I called everybody back
trump, Hey, how you doing How's everything going Everything going good Yeah, well, I wanted to talk to you about Israel, but it's too late
trump, You already did it
trump, And we did it and we got it done and nobody else got it done
trump, And it's something we had to do
trump, I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights
trump, And instead of endless wars, we are forging peace all over the Middle East
trump, And you saw that
trump, And I'm the only man that got nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize and I didn't get any press
trump, They wouldn't
trump, For two of them
trump, Last week, I'm not bragging about it, I'm just saying, I'm the President of the United States because of Kosovo-Serbia, they've been killing each other for years, I worked out a deal for them
trump, I got nominated
trump, And then Israel with Bahrain and UAE, and many more to come
trump, I mean, they all want to do it
trump, We'll have peace in the Middle East without blood all over the sand
trump, No blood
trump, We're going to have peace in the Middle East
trump, So I was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize
trump, And I told this story last night
trump, Should I tell it or not Should I Yes
trump, She wants me to do it
trump, So I go home to our great First Lady
trump, I said, First Lady, you're going to be so proud of me tonight
trump, I was nominated not once but twice for totally separate events by different people
trump, Great people
trump, First lady, I was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize
trump, I was like this
trump, I was nominated
trump, It's a big deal for our country, right And she said, Oh, that's good
trump, I said, Let's turn on the evening news
trump, Let's watch it
trump, This is going to be a big show tonight
trump, Get ready
trump, And NBC, which is one of the most crooked, one of the worst newscasts, and I'm talking about normal NBC, not MSDNC
trump, MSDNC is the worst
trump, So I turned on NBC with Lester Holt, another beauty
trump, And they start with a hurricane and then they went to something, and something else
trump, And I'm saying, First Lady, this is getting a little embarrassing
trump, We're 20 minutes into a half hour show
trump, They haven't mentioned the Nobel Peace Prize
trump, And then it went through the whole show and they never mentioned
trump, Then I got nominated for a second one
trump, They never mentioned
trump, And when Barack Obama, Barack Hussein Obama got nominated, now when Barack Hussein Obama got nominated, he didn't know why he was nominated
trump, It was like right at the very beginning
trump, He didn't do anything
trump, He did nothing and he got nominated
trump, It was the biggest story I've ever seen
trump, But that's okay
trump, In the meantime, we're President and they're not
trump, No, that's right
trump, You would think if you nominated for the Nobel Prize, you'd get maybe half a second
trump, The First Lady, she said, Sorry, darling
trump, That's the way it goes, isn't it Joe Biden opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden
trump, He opposed killing Soleimani
trump, He voted for the Iraq War disaster
trump, He backed the disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal
trump, And he cheered the rise of China as a very positive development for our country
trump, Oh, it's really great
trump, If it were up to Sleepy Joe, bin Laden and Soleimani would be alive today, ISIS would be on a rampage, Iran would control the Middle East, and China would be the dominant power anywhere in the world
trump, And I want to tell you, if you go back a few months before this pandemic, we were gaining, gaining, gaining
trump, We had an insurmountable lead on China
trump, I always heard they were going to catch us by 2019 for 10 years
trump, We were so far beyond, we were doing much better than they were
trump, The Biden agenda would obliterate our economy
trump, He destroyed social security, destroyed protections for pre-existing conditions
trump, That's what he's going to do, drain your Medicare by giving away your healthcare to illegal immigrants
trump, He would end our travel ban to jihadist regions and increase refugee admissions by, listen to this, over 700
trump, And this is the manifesto with Bernie Sanders, with Crazy Bernie
trump, He made this deal with Crazy Bernie
trump, And by the way, a lot of the Crazy Bernie voters last time, four years ago, voted for Trump because of trade, because the one thing they do understand, that our country has been off for years
trump, Biden opposes school choice and vowed to ban charter schools
trump, Very important to have them
trump, In a second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America
trump, They're totally against it
trump, A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans
trump, And just, in conclusion, first of all, it's been a great honor to be with you
trump, This is, really, it's a great state
trump, They're great people
trump, I really mean it
trump, No, I really mean it
trump, Get out there on November 3rd
trump, We've got to win this one big
trump, This is a bad, bad ideology
trump, This is probably a step beyond socialism
trump, I really think in many ways, it's communism we're talking about
trump, This is a step beyond
trump, Socialism's no good
trump, Communism's really bad
trump, But get out there on November 3rd and let's show him your stuff and show them the stuff of all of us
trump, So, in concluding, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we will end the reliance, this ridiculous, crazy reliance on China, and all of these far away lands once and for all
trump, We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States
trump, We will hire more police
trump, And by the way, thank you, police
trump, Thank you, law enforcement
trump, Increased penalties for assaults on law enforcement and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities
trump, We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life
trump, We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms
trump, We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of these ridiculous, stupid, endless, foreign wars
trump, We will maintain America's unrivaled military
trump, Our military might has never been like it is right now because of what we've done
trump, And we had no choice, and hope to God we never have to use it, because if you would ever see the power of what we've done over the last three years, it's almost better for you not to see it
trump, We are the envy of every power, every country in the world
trump, We have weapons that nobody ever even thought possible
trump, And just as I said, hope to God we never have to use them
trump, And the way we don't have to use them is to keep that kind of strength
trump, Nobody's going to be talking to us
trump, We're going to have peace through strength, and it's all made in the U
trump,S
trump,A
trump, Made in the U
trump,S
trump,A
trump, We'll end surprise medical billing, require price transparency
trump, I've already signed it into law
trump, Kicks in on January 1st
trump, It's going to cut your bills down to a level that you wouldn't believe
trump, That doesn't mean the drug companies and the hospital and corporations are happy with me
trump, But that's okay
trump, And further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs by 50, 60 and 70
trump, Big pharma does not like me too much
trump, They're taking ads about me that are so bad, but you get it, you understand it
trump, They're not too thrilled with me, including the rebates
trump, The rebates go back to you
trump, The rebates before went back to very rich people
trump, We will strongly protect Medicare and social security, and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions
trump, And America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars
trump, That's what's happening
trump, NASA is again the leading space station anywhere in the world
trump, There's nothing like a space center, what we've done
trump, And there was grass growing in the runways when I took over three and a half years ago
trump, We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education
trump, We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag
trump, And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God we trust
trump, For years, you had a President who apologized for America
trump, Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great state of Ohio
trump, So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your co-workers, get everybody, and get out and vote
trump, Got to get out and vote
trump, And in your state, in Ohio, early voting has already begun and don't wait
trump, And when you see them cheating on the other side, I don't say if, when, when you see them cheating with those ballots, all of those unsolicited ballots, those millions of ballots, you'll see them, anytime you do, report them to the authorities
trump, The authorities awaiting and watching
trump, From Akron to Columbus, from Cincinnati to Queen City, I know it weller than Cleveland, and from Dayton to Toledo, we inherit the legacy of generations of Ohio patriots, like Neil Armstrong, Annie Oakley, William McKinley, and the amazing Ulysses S
trump, Grant, that's good
trump, Nobody's stock has gone up like Grant
trump, Nobody in the last 10 years
trump, We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world, and you haven't seen anything yet
trump, Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country
trump, We are returning power to you, the American people
trump, With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning
trump, We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God, and together with the incredible people of Ohio, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again
trump, Thank you, Ohio
trump, Get out and vote
trump, Thank you
trump,
trump, Thank you very much, Phoenix
trump, We love to be back
trump, We'll be back a lot
trump, We're going to win that election
trump, Thank you very much
trump, Hello, Phoenix
trump, It's great being here in the great state of Arizona with thousands of hardworking patriots who believe in God, family, and country
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you
trump, And with your help this November, we are going to defeat the radical socialist Democrats and we are going to win Arizona in a landslide
trump, It's all over TV that the folks here tonight have helped a great World War II veteran into the arena
trump, I don't know if he knows it, but he's right now the hottest celebrity in the world
trump, I don't know what's going on here
trump, He might even be hotter than Trump right now, I have to say
trump, Did you see the scene No, he's all over television
trump, Even fake news CNN him on
trump, They say he's a legitimate great hero of World War II
trump, Erwin Julian
trump, Irvin, thank you
trump, And I asked my son Don to get a couple of hats and get some things, and give them to Erwin right now
trump, And I want to thank you
trump, Really, that's a great honor
trump, And thank you for the great job you've done
trump, An American Patriot
trump, Thank you very much
trump, Thank you, Don
trump, How did Don do tonight Okay He's good
trump, Good guy
trump, And he loves this country
trump, So this is truly an incredible time for America
trump, We have the best economy, the most prosperous country that we've ever had, and the most powerful military anywhere in the world by far
trump, Do you remember the good time we had a week ago at the State of the Union You remember that, right And that was my honor
trump, But I proudly declared that we are in the midst of the great American comeback
trump, Our country is stronger today than ever before
trump, And after three years, of very unfair and ridiculous witch hunts and partisan Democrat crusades… It was the radical left's pathetic attempts to nullify your ballots, poison our democracy, and overthrow our entire system of government
trump, But guess what They failed, and our poll numbers are higher today than they've ever been before
trump, And we're standing up to the defense of our Constitution, our freedom and democracy itself
trump, We're doing something that's never been done in the history of our country
trump, This movement has never taken place
trump, Nothing like it ever
trump, And the fake news can attest to it, because if they thought I was saying the wrong thing, it'd be out there immediately
trump, It'd be all over the place
trump, It'd be all over the place
trump, Trump exaggerates
trump, That's terrible what he says
trump, There has never been a movement like this, and it began very early
trump, It began in 2016 with that wonderful, beautiful night
trump, You remember that, right That beautiful night in November
trump, And we're going to have another beautiful night in November
trump, This time, it's going to be November 3rd
trump, Get ready, November 3rd
trump, We're coming
trump, We're coming
trump, So we're having great polls
trump, You're seeing the polls, except for some of the fake ones
trump, And if I was treated fairly… Meaning, if you were treated fairly by the fake news, we'd be up 20 points higher in the polls
trump, There wouldn't even be a competitive election
trump, Unfortunately, it's probably going to be competitive
trump, But I actually think we're going to win by a lot, just like we did last time
trump, But I really believe we'd be up 20 points
trump, I mean, all they do is negative, negative, phony stuff
trump, Russia, Russia, Russia
trump, The impeachment hoax
trump, That's a hoax
trump, But you know, we had great support from the Republican party in the House
trump, It was 197 to nothing
trump, And in the Senate, it was 52 and-a-half to a half
trump, You know what the half was A halfwit
trump, And while the extreme left has been wasting America's time with the hoaxes, we've been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, enacting fair trade deals, securing our border and lifting up citizens of every race, color, religion and creed
trump, By the way, they turned away 21,000 people outside, so feel very good
trump, Feel very good
trump, We haven't had an empty seat
trump, You know what We haven't had… True
trump, We haven't had an empty seat, and this is a tribute to all of us because this is a movement like nobody's ever seen
trump, But we haven't had an empty seat since your great… and this is a great first lady
trump, Came down the escalator with me in Trump Tower a long time ago
trump, We haven't had an empty seat
trump, From our rural communities to our inner cities, we're expanding the blessings of America to all of our citizens
trump, We added another 225,000 new jobs last month alone
trump, You saw that, the geniuses
trump, You saw that
trump, You saw that last month
trump, They were doing predictions on one of the shows
trump, What do you think Well, I think 60,000
trump, What do you think I think 100,000
trump, What do you think I think 84,000
trump, These are the ones that tell you all about how to invest
trump, What do you think And then they came out 225,000, the market goes up again
trump, 225,000
trump, 225,000
trump, So many manufacturing jobs
trump, So many that frankly, we're never going to come back
trump, Remember, you need a magic wand, right They came back
trump, And remember this, we're paying interest
trump, The past administration didn't pay interest
trump, They pumped money in like it was candy
trump, And we didn't pump money in, we took money out
trump, And not that I was happy about that, because I disagree with it
trump, Because frankly, if we kept the old practice which frankly, some people could dispute one way or the other, we would have been up in my opinion, another 10,000 points in the Dow
trump, And we've set 144 records on the stock market in three years, 144 records
trump, 144 records
trump, Record stock market
trump, And you know what that means That your 401Ks are up 60, 70, 80, 90, 100
trump, Guys come up to me
trump, He said, Mr
trump, President, I just want to thank you
trump, My wife used to look at me like I was a total loser, sir
trump, Every year we lost money for years and years
trump, She said what the hell is wrong with you, Henry And this year sir, I'm up 92
trump, She loves to me again
trump, She thinks I'm a genius
trump, 92 401K
trump, She thinks I'm a genius, sir
trump, She loves me again
trump, Shows what money can do, right But that makes… And think of this
trump, Seven million new jobs since we were elected, we were elected
trump, And when I took over, ISIS was all over the place
trump, And we immediately started
trump, We have destroyed 100 of the ISIS caliphate
trump, We have killed the founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi is dead
trump, And we just took out the world's top terrorist, Qasem Soleimani, ending his evil reign of terror forever
trump, And the fake news doesn't want to tell you that
trump, They don't want to tell you that
trump, They don't want to tell you
trump, In fact, do you remember the dog Great dog, Conan
trump, When we took out, right We love Conan
trump, Conan's a tough dog
trump, But when we took out al-Baghdadi, Conan… Remember this Conan got more publicity than President Trump
trump, That's okay
trump, They were looking for al-Baghdadi for 16 years
trump, We found him and we took him out
trump, We killed another one last week
trump, The head of Al-Qaeda
trump, He was gone, dead
trump, And America is respected again, respected like never before
trump, We're respected again
trump, We're no longer the laughingstock that gets taken advantage by every country, including by the way, our allies, who in many cases take a bigger advantage than our enemies
trump, I will tell you that
trump, They take big advantage, but not so much anymore
trump, We're winning
trump, We're winning like never before
trump, Washington Democrats keep on losing their minds
trump, They hate the fact that we're winning
trump, We're winning big
trump, We're winning, winning, winning
trump, And that is why millions of registered Democrat voters are leaving their party to join our movement
trump, They're joining our great Republican party in droves
trump, You see it all the time
trump, I just spoke to some of your leaders
trump, He said, This is unbelievable what's happening
trump, This is unbelievable
trump, You know, there have never been rallies like that
trump, Sleepy Joe Biden the other day had 68 people
trump, And now they have a new member of the crew, mini Mike
trump, Mini Mike
trump, No boxes, we call him no boxes
trump, And I hear he's getting pounded tonight
trump, You know, he's in a debate
trump, I hear they're pounding him
trump, He spent 500 million so far, and I think he has 15 points
trump, It just came out
trump, Hey fake news, how many points does he have right now, 15 They won't tell you the truth
trump, They won't tell you the truth
trump, MSDNC, MSDNC is worse than CNN
trump, They're owned by a company called Comcast
trump, You can have Comcast, a bunch of phonies
trump, But MSDNC is worse than CNN, and they're all pretty bad
trump, You know, they just came out with a poll
trump, They just came out with a poll a little while ago
trump, Mini Mike was at 15, and crazy Bernie was at 31
trump, That's a lot
trump, And mini Mike just spent 500 million
trump, But the DNC is going to take it away from Bernie again
trump, That's okay, because we don't care who the hell it is
trump, We're going to win
trump, We're going to win
trump, We have to
trump, Well let me tell you, these crooked politicians, they really took away three years from us
trump, Because despite the fact and nobody disputes it, that we've done more in three years with the tax cuts and regulation cuts and the military and the choice and everything, we've done more than any administration in history
trump, We've done more
trump, But think of it, think of it
trump, We did it with phony witch hunts
trump, We did it with the impeachment hoax over our head the whole time
trump, We did it under circumstances that should never ever happened to another President again
trump, True
trump, But with your energy and enthusiasm this November, we're going to take back the House, we're going to hold the Senate, and we are going to keep the White House
trump, So we're thrilled to be joined tonight by some of the best, greatest
trump, I love them
trump, Leaders in America, Arizona leaders
trump, I want to start
trump, Come on up here, Governor Doug Ducey
trump, Come on up here, Doug
trump, Come on up here
trump, You're going to speak in a second

trump, Do me a favor before I introduce a very special guest, I'd like to ask your great Governor… You know, he won like by 16 points
trump, It wasn't even a contest
trump, You know, I'm very competitive
trump, I want to beat him
trump, Will you please get out to the polls so we can beat him But he's tough to beat
trump, Doug Ducey, say a couple of words, please
trump, Please
trump, These are great people, great people
trump, Thank you very much
trump, So you know, before I introduce somebody very important to all of us, to me… Also, I have to say with us tonight is an Arizona hockey great, a friend of mine
trump, He's a great golfer too
trump, He's a tough golfer
trump, I'll tell you, he's tough to beat
trump, He's tough as hell
trump, And if you beat him in golf, he'll try and beat you physically
trump, He doesn't care
trump, He was the toughest hockey player
trump, He was one of these guys, he could beat you one way and if he couldn't, he just beat them up, right He'd beat him up
trump, And he's a friend of mine
trump, He's a great guy, Jeremy Roenik
trump, Where's Jeremy Where is he Thank you, Jeremy
trump, He's a winner
trump, We're also joined by Donald, Jr
trump, and Kimberly
trump, They're great people, great
trump, And RNC co-chairman, Tommy Hicks
trump, And RNC finance chairman, also happens on a team called the Chicago Cubs, I shouldn't tell you that… Todd Ricketts
trump, So finally, it's my great honor to introduce a tremendous person, a great fighter pilot
trump, A lot of people don't know that
trump, She's a great fighter pilot and a warrior Senate
trump, She helped us so much during the impeachment hoax, she didn't wobble one bit, Martha McSally
trump, You know, Martha's tough on the border
trump, And she's working with me to strengthen our military still further, and lower your prescription drug prices
trump, We're making a lot of progress
trump, But her opponent, I have to say this Martha, a guy named Mark Kelly
trump, Even the Democrats don't like him much
trump, He wants to raise your taxes, open your borders, give away free healthcare to illegal immigrants, and he wants to obliterate your second amendment
trump, He wants to get rid of it
trump, The radical liberal Democrats from California and Massachusetts, they're pouring money into Kelly's campaign, because they know that he's a rubber stamp for crying Chuck Schumer, crying Chuck, and nervous Nancy wacko Pelosi
trump, And we're going to have a new Speaker
trump, But that's why Martha has my complete and total support and endorsement, and we have to all get out there and make sure that Martha McSally… She's a warrior
trump, Let me tell you, you don't know
trump, We don't know
trump, People don't know, people
trump, This one is tough as hell, and that's what we need
trump, Martha McSally
trump, Thank you
trump, We'll be back
trump, Thank you Martha
trump, Well, she's right
trump, How about that Congressman Al Green We can't beat him, so we have to impeach him
trump, How about that That's not what our… as they call them, the founders
trump, How many times did you hear the name, the founders That's not what the founders had in mind
trump, But we're going to have a big, big election victory
trump, We're working to- But we're going to have a big, big election victory
trump, We're working together
trump, I don't think the Republican party has ever been more unified than it is right now
trump, I really don't believe so
trump, So whatever you can do for Martha, we need her
trump, It's been so incredible
trump, Thank you very much
trump, Thank you for everything, Martha
trump, I appreciate it
trump, Thank you
trump, Together we're building the world's most prosperous economy and the most inclusive society anywhere
trump, We're inclusive
trump, This is the Republican party
trump, We're inclusive
trump, Right here in… Right You know that
trump, Right here in America, right here in Arizona, we've created 240,000 new jobs right here
trump, Including over 60,000 new manufacturing and construction jobs here
trump, Nobody thought it was possible
trump, You've had the best year that you've ever had
trump, Arizona, you've had the best year, the most successful year that you've ever had in the history of the country
trump, It's the best year you've ever had
trump, So I'm going to take all the credit away from your governor
trump, I don't care
trump, No, we have a great team with Doug and everybody else, but you've had the greatest year
trump, You know that, Doug, number one year in the history of your state
trump, It's an incredible achievement
trump, Incredible achievement
trump, I don't know, this has to be pretty good stuff on the debate stage
trump, We'll talk about, Well, you had the best… In many states, the best year they've ever had
trump, Then they said, Let's get a new president
trump, I don't think that's going to work so easily
trump, The country's had the best year it's ever had
trump, Let's get a new president
trump, Let's put in crazy Bernie
trump, Let's go
trump, Crazy Bernie
trump, Unemployment has reached its slowest rate in over 51 years, half a century
trump, The average unemployment rate for my administration… Think of this
trump, The average, so we're talking about now more than three years, is the lowest for any US president in recorded history
trump, The unemployment rate among African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans has reached record lows, lowest in history
trump, African American youth unemployment has reached an all time low in the history of our country
trump, African American and Hispanic American poverty has plummeted to the lowest rate ever recorded
trump, The unemployment rate for women has reached the lowest level in 71 years
trump, Soon to be historic
trump, And veterans' unemployment has dropped to a record low
trump, We're working with our veterans, we're taking care of our veterans like nobody's ever taken care of our veterans
trump, The unemployment rate for disabled Americans has reached the lowest level in history
trump, Workers without a high school diploma, you have a lot of them
trump, They left high school
trump, They said, I should have finished
trump, They left
trump, They can't go back
trump, They left
trump, We've achieved the lowest unemployment rate without a diploma ever recorded in US history
trump, Isn't that great They're great numbers
trump, Hispanic Americans right now, more than 500,000 own a home
trump, More than 500,000 more own a home
trump, And we've lifted 10 million people off of the welfare rolls
trump, Think of that
trump, 10 million people have come off of the welfare rolls
trump, And happily
trump, Not that we did anything
trump, They have jobs and they love them
trump, They're making much more money and they love getting up and going for work
trump, If they don't like that job, they can get another one, because people are starving to get great employees right now
trump, They're starving to get great employees
trump, Since my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by 47, three times faster than the increase for the top 1
trump, Median income
trump, Think of this
trump, This is such a big deal
trump, Median household income reached the highest level in the history of our country
trump, Under President Bush, in eight years it went to 450 more
trump, Under President Barack Hussein Obama, under a period of eight years, it went to 975
trump, Under president Donald J
trump, Trump… Did you ever hear of him In only three years, including regulation cuts and tax cuts… Because the other ones raise taxes
trump, We cut taxes by the record amount
trump, It went to 10, 000 per family
trump, A record
trump, A record
trump, That's why our consumer right now, our people, they're booming with cash
trump, That's one of the reasons our economy is doing so much better
trump, China had the worst year in the last 67 years
trump, Asia's doing poorly
trump, Europe is doing poorly
trump, The United States is doing great
trump, We're doing the best we've ever done
trump, The best we've ever done
trump, To lift up forgotten communities that need investment, and these are really communities that need it the most, we created Opportunity Zones
trump, We worked with Tim Scott, the great senator from South Carolina
trump, His idea
trump, He came in and saw me
trump, I said, Let's give it a shot
trump, Nothing's worked over the years, but this has really worked
trump, Now jobs and investment are now pouring into 168 newly designated Opportunity Zones right here in Arizona alone
trump, From Apache to Navajo and Maricopa Counties
trump, We're supporting working families by fighting pay
trump, We are doing a job with paid family leave
trump, We're doing something that nobody's ever done to this extent
trump, Reducing the cost of childcare and giving 40 million American families an average of 2,200 in their pocket thanks to the Republican child tax credit
trump, Our historic regulatory reduction campaign is restoring American liberty and cutting through job, killing red tape like nobody has ever cut regulations before
trump, We've ended the war on American energy, lowering utility bills, reducing prices at the pump, and eliminating our reliance on hostile foreign suppliers
trump, For the first time, America is now energy independent
trump, Such beautiful words
trump, Energy independent
trump, We fought wars
trump, We did everything we could
trump, We used to take the straits and everybody else benefited
trump, We'd them clear so that other countries could take oil from the Middle East with… That nobody paid us
trump, Now they're starting to pay us a lot of money, folks
trump, They took advantage of us
trump, But we have everything we need right now
trump, We have made such progress in the last three years with pipelines
trump, The Keystone Pipeline, Keystone XL
trump, I approved it
trump, The Dakota Access Pipeline
trump, I approved it
trump, 48,000 jobs
trump, We're reversing decades of calamitous trade policies
trump, The worst trade deals any human being has ever seen
trump, I said, Who made these deals The worst, stupidest deals I've ever seen
trump, They were good for other nations
trump, If you like other nations, that's great
trump, But we're now putting America first
trump, It's very simple
trump, For years, Washington politicians took money from lobbyists, global corporations, and really, the most corrupt special interests anybody's ever seen
trump, To ship our jobs and our factories to other countries
trump, We lost our taxes, we lost our workers, we lost our companies, and we did nothing about it
trump, Now we've done a lot about it because companies are pouring back in
trump, America lost one in four manufacturing jobs following the twin disasters of NAFTA, the worst deal ever made, worst trade deal ever made, and one that was almost as bad and gave China an entrance into being a rocket ship when they entered the World Trade, WTO
trump, One of the worst deals that we participated in this
trump, By the way, we just won 7
trump,5 billion in a lawsuit with WTO
trump, We weren't winning anything
trump, We weren't winning anything, but they said, I think this guy's going to pull out
trump, They treated us so unfairly
trump, We were always in the minority position
trump, I mean, who the hell negotiated these deals But they look at us and they say, Look, if we're not treated fairly, we're gone
trump, All of a sudden, we're winning all these cases
trump, But we just won 7
trump,5 billion
trump, 7
trump,5 billion
trump, Did you know that, Doug 7
trump,5 billion
trump, But under this administration, the great betrayal is over
trump, America's no longer for sale
trump, America is no longer for sale
trump, Those days are over
trump, Two generations of politicians came and went promising to replace NAFTA
trump, How many times have you heard we're going to replace NAFTA Probably the number one reason I ran for office
trump, Are we glad I ran for office I think so
trump, It's funny, I was watching the different… I find it fascinating
trump, I'm watching the different returns coming in and I'm watching as much as I can of this stuff
trump, I love it
trump, We all love it
trump, If you don't love it, you're not going to do it very well
trump, The crazy New York Times, which was a dead newspaper when I ran, it was dead as a doornail
trump, A month before I ran, Doug, I held up a New York Times, it was like what you get thrown in your face at a supermarket
trump, It was a thing
trump, It just flew away
trump, There was nothing
trump, Now it's doing very well
trump, But you know what Someday we won't be here
trump, When we're not, those papers are in big trouble
trump, But this thing was a dead newspaper
trump, But I was watching and they had an article this weekend about people that spent their own money and how they're doing
trump, They have Mini Mike has spent 411 million
trump, It's a question mark, how's he going to… I'll tell you how he's going to do
trump, He's probably not going to get the democratic nomination
trump, That's how he's going to do
trump, But Mini Mike, 411
trump, Then they had this idiot, Steyer
trump, We call him impeachment Steyer
trump, How did that work out, Steyer He's another beauty
trump, The guy worked… He spent 210 million
trump, He got one-third of 1 in Iowa
trump, In New Hampshire he did much better
trump, He got less than 3
trump, Guy's in there for like 250 million
trump, How did it work out, Steyer You jerk
trump, I never even heard of him
trump, I never even heard of him
trump, I turn on every time… For years, I'm turning on… Impeach him
trump, They don't even know why
trump, They never say why
trump, They don't have any reason
trump, Impeach the president
trump, This guy spent a fortune on this stuff, so it worked out pretty good
trump, But anyway, so then I go and I look
trump, It has Mini Mike's… Question marks
trump, I can give you the answer, but right now they have to have a question mark, right Then they go down and they had other people
trump, Some of them I like
trump, They have Ross Perot, who honestly… It was a tough day for Bush when he joined the campaign
trump, Because Clinton didn't win
trump, Ross Perot took away 19 of the votes
trump, Didn't Clinton get 41 or 43 Give me a break
trump, But that's okay
trump, Whatever
trump, But they had Ross Perot spent like 100 million, which is probably double if you bring it up to today's dollars
trump, Then they have different people
trump, A friend of mine who ran, Steve Forbes, he ran twice
trump, He was in for a lot
trump, Then they had Donald Trump
trump, Now, this is your own money
trump, This is your own money
trump, I said I'd spend a lot of money on my primaries
trump, We'll see how the hell we do
trump, It's amazing
trump, Once you win, money comes in
trump, It comes in pretty fast
trump, What's that all about But so in the middle they had Trump, and then they had four or five that were behind me
trump, Lot of money spent
trump, Loss, loss, loss, loss, loss
trump, But in the middle they have Donald Trump
trump, It didn't say 500 million, and it didn't say 250 like this Steyer guy
trump, It didn't say… It said 70 million of my own money
trump, I spent 70
trump, It said, Donald Trump won the presidency of the United States
trump, Right We won
trump, My father would teach me, if you could spend less and win, that's better than spending a lot and winning
trump, Crooked Hillary spent at least three times more than we did and lost
trump, Crooked as hell
trump, She's crooked as hell
trump, We have a double-sided justice
trump, It's very unfair what's going on
trump, Very unfair
trump, But let's see how it all works out, folks
trump, Let's see how it all works out
trump, I hope you're going to be happy
trump, I hope you're going to be happy, because there are a lot of dishonest slimeballs out there
trump, Dishonest scum
trump, Dirty cops, a lot of dirty cops
trump, By the way, the FBI, those guys in that are incredible
trump, But the ones on top, they were absolute scum
trump, What they were trying to do, if that happened to Obama, or a Democrat, or especially a liberal Democrat, they'd be in jail for 50 years and it would have taken place two years ago already
trump, They spied on our campaign
trump, Remember that
trump, After they spied, we won
trump, Then after we won, they tried to get us out of office
trump, It's never happened before in the history of our country, and we can't let that happen
trump, We can never ever excuse it
trump, We can never let them get away with that
trump, Never let them get away with it
trump, But we keep our promises that we work hard and our economy is great
trump, The last month, we ended the NAFTA… Look, you saw it
trump, NAFTA catastrophe
trump, That's what it was
trump, We ended that catastrophe
trump, Again, I really ran because of NAFTA
trump, I said, How stupid
trump, All over the place
trump, In your state, but you go to New England, empty factories, empty buildings
trump, Still you have empty buildings
trump, We lost so much
trump, We lost 60,000 factories and plants
trump, I signed that brand new, beautiful US-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law
trump, The USMCA is a gigantic victory for farmers, and ranchers, and manufacturers all across the great state of Arizona
trump, By the way, for people with the small farms and small businesses, if you love your children, you can now leave your companies, you can leave your farm, you can leave your ranch to your children, and you don't have to to pay, they don't pay a death tax
trump, They don't pay an inheritance tax
trump, A big deal
trump, That's a big deal
trump, So if you love your children, it's good
trump, If you don't love your children, it doesn't matter
trump, Don't leave it to them, if you don't love
trump, If your children are no good to you, don't give them anything
trump, Let them go out and work like hell
trump, No, if you love… Does anybody in this incredible audience… Man, this is a big building
trump, Does anybody not love their children Anybody Do I have a hand Do I have a… There's a hand
trump, You've got to be kidding
trump, You've got to be kidding
trump, So then you don't care about the tax
trump, Okay, don't worry about it
trump, He says, No, I don't care about that one
trump, Well, that's good
trump, You look like a nice guy too
trump, He's tough
trump, You'd love to be his kid, wouldn't you But I also took the strongest ever action to confront China's massive theft of American jobs
trump, Our strategy worked
trump, Last month, we signed a groundbreaking trade agreement with China that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, and boost American exports
trump, China will invest 250 billion a year into the United States and buy our products and create jobs
trump, Nothing like that has ever happened before
trump, After years of building up other countries, we are finally rebuilding our country
trump, That's the way we want it
trump, We are finally putting our country first
trump, We are putting America first
trump, On no issue have Washington Democrats more thoroughly sold out the American people than immigration
trump, You know it almost better than anybody
trump, Anybody, Doug
trump, You know it better than anybody, what they've done on your border, but we're stopping that border
trump, That border is clogged, and we've started the big wall right in Arizona
trump, We build a lot of wall
trump, That's a big one
trump, That's a big one
trump, Top of the line
trump, Before I came into office, the far left's policy of open borders allowed deadly drugs to flow freely into our country, poisoning our children
trump, Including, as you know very well right here in Arizona, Washington Democrats put the needs of illegal immigrants before the wellbeing of American citizens
trump, They want to let anyone from around the world simply walk across the border
trump, Then they want to give them a lifetime of free welfare, healthcare, everything
trump, They want to give them everything
trump, For a long period of time, they were treated… You know this before I came
trump, They were treated far better than our veterans were treated
trump, Now our veterans are treated great
trump, True
trump, Illegal immigration costs Arizona taxpayers more than 2 billion every year
trump, Two billion you're paying
trump, Nearly 20 of Arizona's annual budget in general funds goes toward this big problem
trump, For the amount of money Washington Democrats want to spend supporting illegal immigrants, we could rebuild our cities all throughout America, which is what we should be doing
trump, Under my administration, we are finally taking care of our own citizens, including millions and millions of legal immigrants who follow our laws, pay their taxes, and are entitled to a government that protects their families and their communities
trump, Every day, Democrats' open borders policies are harming and killing innocent lives
trump, In Arizona alone last year, ICE officers arrested over 4,500 criminal aliens charged or convicted of dangerous offenses including robbery, rape, and murder
trump, Right here in Phoenix, an illegal alien chased a man through a parking lot and shot him in cold blood, then walked over to the victim and shot him four more times right in the face as he laid dying in the street
trump, This savage animal had previously been deported after serving six years in prison
trump, He was in prison six years
trump, He was there six years and nobody wants to talk about it
trump, They want to protect them
trump, Last year in Tucson, another illegal alien was sentenced to 10 years for repeatedly raping a vulnerable young woman
trump, Yet left wing politicians oppose all detention of illegal aliens, even convicted criminals, and they support deadly sanctuary cities that release these criminal aliens directly into America's communities
trump, Thankfully, Arizona has banned sanctuary cities
trump, With a Republican majority in Congress, we will ban them in every state in America
trump, 30 in the morning
trump, I then went to California, made two speeches
trump, I then went someplace else
trump, I said, Am I finished No, you've got to go to Arizona tonight and speak in front of like 25,000 people
trump, I said, That's okay
trump, That's okay
trump, I said, That's okay
trump, No, I said, That's okay, because I love this unbelievable energy in this crowd
trump, But you know what Honestly, there's tremendous energy in our nation
trump, There's tremendous energy in our nation
trump, Greatest nation in the world
trump, Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, we have reduced illegal border crossings for eight straight months in a row, which will soon be a record
trump, Illegal crossings are down 75 since last spring
trump, The month of January saw the fewest illegal border crossings in two years
trump, And we've ended catch and release, a horrible Democrat policy that we got terminated
trump, Border patrol, great people, have seized the largest amount of deadly narcotics ever recorded in the history of our country this year
trump, We've deported record numbers of gang members, including the worst gang of all, MS-13
trump, Thousands and thousands of people have been thrown the hell out of our country
trump, We've done more to secure the border than any administration in history
trump, We're building the wall, as I said, faster than ever
trump, It will soon be almost one new mile a day
trump, We're looking for that
trump, Washington Democrats have never been more extreme, taking cues from crazy Bernie Sanders
trump, How's he doing tonight 132 congressional Democrats have signed up for Bernie's healthcare takeover of the world
trump, Think of this, 180 million Americans are going to lose healthcare coverage under this plan
trump, But if you don't mind, I'm not going to criticize it tonight
trump, Let them keep going and I'll start talking about it about two weeks out from the election
trump, Okay Because I don't want him to change
trump, Please don't change
trump, Same with the Green New Deal
trump, I don't want to talk about it, Doug, tonight
trump, I don't want to talk about it
trump, I came up with the name Pocahontas
trump, Too early
trump, But fortunately, she's self-destructed anyway
trump, Did you ever see a phony like that She's a phony
trump, She lost because she couldn't keep it straight on her own heritage
trump, She said she was an Indian
trump, I said,  I have more Indian blood in me than you have, and I have none
trump, She said, Oh, and she panicked
trump, She panicked, and she had a test
trump, You know the result, 1124th
trump, I think I win the bet
trump, Somewhere along the line, I think I win
trump, No, she… I did it too early
trump, I would have saved it, but I guess it was effective
trump, She's essentially gone-zo, so… One of those things
trump, While the socialist Democrats are try- … one of those things
trump, While the socialist Democrats are trying to destroy American healthcare and your social security, my administration is protecting your social security, your Medicare, and is fighting to give you great healthcare
trump, And that's what we're getting
trump, That's right
trump, One of the big secrets
trump, The Democrats won't let us say it
trump, They want to keep that as quiet as possible
trump, Look what they gave you, the worst healthcare
trump, And what we've done, we've gotten rid of things that nobody could believe that was so bad for you
trump, Everybody was happy with defending your right to keep your doctor and plan of your choice
trump, We're making healthcare better and much, much cheaper while premiums more than doubled in the last five years before I took office, we are now offering plans that are up to 60 less expensive than they were, and it's better healthcare
trump, A lot of people don't know this
trump, People don't know this
trump, They think that's their issue
trump, It's not
trump, They failed on healthcare
trump, We're protecting people with preexisting conditions, and we always will
trump, And by the way, we're trying to get rid of Obamacare, but we're managing it incredibly, but we're trying to get rid so we can give you a great healthcare plan and protect preexisting conditions
trump, Remember that
trump, We're trying to get rid of it, but while we're having it, we're managing it really much better than they did
trump, Remember they built the 5 billion website Remember that It was supposed to cost 5 million
trump, It cost 5 billion
trump, 5 billion
trump, I mean, you could get a kid out of high school
trump, I have a son
trump, He's a young boy, 13
trump, He uses a computer
trump, He could have given them a healthcare site
trump, I would say he would have charged them 100, Barron Trump, and it would've worked
trump, He's so good
trump, Hi dad
trump, How you doing, dad How's it going Bing, bing, bong
trump, I said, Don't play with that while you're talking to me
trump, What's going on, dad These kids are incredible, right The kids, they make us look like babies with that
trump, But he could have given you a great site for about 2
trump, They spent 5 billion on a site that never worked
trump, By the way, speaking of that, how did they do with their vote count in Iowa And I hear, I hear, I don't want to say it
trump, I don't want to jinx them because, of course, I want them to do well, but I do
trump, We don't have anything
trump, Nobody's running against us in so many states
trump, It's sort of nice
trump, We can save the thunder, right But I hear that in Nevada
trump, I'm hearing bad things about their vote count
trump, I hear a lot of bad things are happening, like they don't know what the hell they're doing
trump, I turned on the other night, Iowa, I wanted to see … And by the way, we set a record in the history of Iowa
trump, We had more votes than anybody's ever had as an incumbent president
trump, Same thing in New Hampshire
trump, It's a good sign
trump, It's a good sign
trump, By a lot
trump, By the way, by a lot
trump, But I'm hearing that, and I hope this isn't the case because I'd like to find out who the hell won
trump, We still don't know who won in Iowa
trump, I heard coming over here they're still working on the count
trump, No, no, no
trump, He said, You won
trump, Yeah, I think we did win
trump, I think we did
trump, Very good
trump, That's very good
trump, I have to thank you, that one
trump, That's very good
trump, No, we did win
trump, Look, we are winning
trump, We're winning big
trump, We have fake polls out there
trump, These guys do fake polls
trump, They are fake polls
trump, I had a poll
trump, It's just like it was in 2016
trump, I'd hear these polls
trump, I'd hear women didn't like me, and I did great with women
trump, I hear everyone didn't like me
trump, Nobody liked me
trump, Nobody liked me
trump, And then we won
trump, Thank you, women
trump, Nobody liked me 2016
trump, No, no, I hear that
trump, Remember, women didn't like him, and at the end of that he did great with women
trump, He did great with this
trump, He did great with everybody
trump, We did great with everybody
trump, Remember, 306 to 223
trump, That's a slaughter
trump, That's a slaughter
trump, Remember, they said he cannot get, they used the word path
trump, There is no path, right, to 270 I was at 269 if I did great, but they said there's no chance
trump, But I was at 269, so I went to Maine
trump, I love Maine
trump, I went to Maine
trump, Maine's cut in half
trump, And one Maine has one
trump, I went there four or five times
trump, People are great
trump, I won it
trump, And they were right
trump, There is no path to 270, but there was a path to 306
trump, These people
trump, These people
trump, There is no path
trump, That's right, Doug
trump, They said there is no path, the fake news media
trump, There is no path for Donald Trump
trump, And then they said the evening of the election, It's going to be a really short night for Donald Trump
trump, Thank God, we got rid of this guy
trump, Because they did the exit polls going out, right And I was even told, but a lot of people didn't want to talk about it
trump, The highest number in history of people that said very nasty language, but I'm not going to use that name because you'll kill me if I use it
trump, So I won't use it
trump, It's a much better story if I use it because that's the truth
trump, That's what they said
trump, How did you vote Usually, they say, I voted for Clinton, or, I voted for Trump
trump, Right How'd you vote None of your business
trump, See, I'm being nice, right I'll keep it that way because otherwise we'll ruin the whole evening
trump, They'll say, His language, right Even this tough guy in the front says, I agree
trump, How did you vote No, I don't want to tell you
trump, How did you vote None of your damn business
trump, I'm not going to tell you
trump, How did you vote I'm not …  And it was like this massive number, right Massive
trump, So everybody, they just didn't count that
trump, So they said numbers are looking unbelievably well for crooked Hillary Clinton
trump, They're looking unbelievable
trump, This is going to be a very short evening for Donald Trump
trump, We finally will be rid of this guy
trump, And then the numbers started coming in
trump, The numbers started coming in, and it started with the great state of Florida
trump, Donald Trump has won the state of Florida
trump, And then that beautiful convention center, the most beautiful stage I've ever seen
trump, And they knew something was going on because they didn't pay the final payment for the fireworks two weeks before
trump, Right In fact, I went to the fireworks company, and I said, I'll give you five cents on the dollar for your fireworks, even though they were no way near where my area was
trump, We were at a hotel in Midtown
trump, We liked the location better than where she chose, but they built the most … we remember that beautiful stage
trump, It was shaped like the United States of America
trump, And by the end, it didn't look too good
trump, Did you ever see more unhappy people So they go, Donald Trump has won the great state of Florida
trump, They go, Whoa, whoa, whoa
trump, They outspent me like five to one
trump, Only negative ads
trump, They're all negative
trump, So by the time people got into the voters booth, they only knew one thing
trump, She hated Donald Trump, but they said, What the hell does she stand for What does she do Every ad was a negative ad
trump, So it tells you negative ads, at least against me, aren't so good
trump, They can be effective
trump, But I think they spent like  2 billion on negative ads
trump, Everything was negative
trump, So nobody knew what the hell she spent
trump, You know, her husband said she was going to lose
trump, Her husband's a professional
trump, Her husband said, You better go to Michigan because I was there and they got a TrumpPence sign on every lawn I've ever seen
trump, You better go to Wisconsin, Hillary
trump, You better go to Wisconsin
trump, She said, No, we haven't lost Wisconsin in 36 years
trump, No, no, Hillary, you got to go there
trump, I'm telling you, I don't like what I saw
trump, No, what do you know He's a professional politician
trump, She wasn't
trump, It's one of those little problems in life
trump, So then it came in, and then we won South Carolina
trump, We won North Carolina
trump, Right And we were leading Pennsylvania by so much that if I lost, remember at 2 of the vote left, if I lost every single vote, I win by a lot
trump, They refused, the fake news refused to call it
trump, I kept saying, We won Pennsylvania
trump, Why don't they call it It was very late in the evening when they called it because they are fake, they're crooked
trump, They are fake
trump, And I said, Why don't they call Pennsylvania But some beautiful things happened
trump, And by the way, Ohio, we won by one of the largest margins ever
trump, The great, great, great state of Ohio
trump, Remember Remember, they used to say a year before the election, they said, Well, nobody can win
trump, Nobody, unless you win the great state of Ohio
trump, And we won the great state of Ohio, and we won it big
trump, We knew we were going to win it
trump, And now we're up a lot more than we were up even then, because you know why We're bringing back jobs
trump, We're bringing back factories
trump, Everybody's working
trump, Nobody's ever had a better year than we've been having
trump, And we've been doing it for a long time, right Almost from the beginning
trump, And don't let them try and take credit, because if they came in, we would have ended up in a massive recession or worse, the D word, depression
trump, We would have been, because they were going to put more and more and more regulations on
trump, And I'll tell you, maybe bigger than even the tax cuts, and I did it sooner, were the regulation cuts
trump, We freed up our nation to go back to work
trump, True
trump, So then we won Wisconsin, and then we won Michigan because those companies, now they're pouring back in
trump, The auto companies are pouring back in, and Wisconsin's doing great with the farmers that Canada was taking
trump, You know, Canada was charging our farmers 287 tariffs for dairy products
trump, Okay So what happens is this, we're working on healthcare
trump, We're fighting to stop surprise medical billing
trump, I just signed an executive order imposing price transparency because when providers are required to show their prices, those same prices fall very fast
trump, We've approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs, which are just as good as the brand drugs, but they cost a tiny fraction
trump, We've totally transformed veteran's healthcare, including getting long-sought VA choice and VA accountability, which they said could not be done
trump, And we passed the spectacular right to try
trump, So if you're in trouble, and I hope nobody in this massive arena's in trouble, but if you're in trouble, you can go and get whatever the new drug or whatever where we have the best doctors, best hospital, best labs
trump, You get it
trump, And the luck we are having, we are saving so many lives
trump, It's incredible what's happening
trump, People would go to Europe
trump, They'd go to Asia
trump, If they had no money, they'd go home and die
trump, Now they have the right to use our drugs before they're approved
trump, Think of that
trump, Before they're approved
trump, And we're very importantly combating the opioid epidemic
trump, Drug overdose deaths
trump, The overdose deaths have declined for the first time in 34 years, and life expectancy is rising again in our nation
trump, We've launched bold new initiatives combating kidney disease and Alzheimer's disease
trump, We're making tremendous progress, and we're pursuing new advances in neo-medical research
trump, Think of that, neonatal research, the numbers are incredible
trump, What's happened is incredible, to care for America's youngest patients and breaking all records in doing so
trump, All of the radical Democrats in the presidential debates have declared their unlimited support for extreme late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up until the very moment of birth
trump, That is why in my State of the Union, I asked Congress to prohibit late-term abortion of babies because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God
trump, The Democrat party is the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, socialism, blatant corruption, and the total destruction of your Second Amendment
trump, The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, the Second Amendment and the late great Abraham Lincoln, right Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background, every community, and every walk of life
trump, We are the party of boundless optimism, excitement, energy, and enthusiasm
trump, We have tremendous energy
trump, Tremendous energy
trump, Everybody says to me, Where do you get the energy Because I love what we're doing
trump, I see the results, and they're happening faster than you even think
trump, You see the numbers
trump, They're happening faster than you would even think
trump, We are asking all Americans to join our incredible movement
trump, We are the big tent
trump, We are the big party
trump, We are the party with big ideas for the future
trump, Republicans are fighting for school choice because no parent should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school
trump, Right Right To keep our community safer and give former prisoners a second chance at life
trump, There's been nothing like this
trump, I passed criminal justice reform, not the Democrats
trump, I did it with the Republicans, and this could not have been done by anybody but me and the Republican party
trump, The Democrats did not do it
trump, They could never have done it
trump,  Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh
trump, We have invested 2
trump,2 trillion to rebuild the United States military, including nearly 200 million for Marine Corps Air Station Yuma
trump, Right I recognized Israel as the true capital and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem
trump, We recognize Israel sovereignty over the Golan Heights
trump, They've been trying to get it for 52 years
trump, And for years, you watched as your politicians apologized for America
trump, You saw that
trump, They apologized
trump, Now you have a president who is standing up for America, and we are standing up for the people of Arizona
trump, At stake in our present battle is the survival of our nation
trump, It is
trump, This election is so important
trump, It's the survival of our nation
trump, If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for to secure, then we must devote everything we have toward victory in November of 2020
trump, You're the forgotten people no more
trump, Right No deplorables, right No deplorables
trump, Who knew that was going to turn out to be such a disaster But you know, she used the worst word
trump, What was the word she used Irredeemables, right I thought that was the problem
trump, No, it was deplorable
trump, So what the hell do I know about politics She said, You're irredeemable and deplorable
trump, I said, Oh, that irredeemable's terrible
trump, The next day people are showing up
trump, Women, I'm a deplorable
trump, Only this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp, which is vicious, horrible, ugly, and evil
trump, Much worse than I thought
trump, But we're getting there and not pleasant
trump, A bunch of really bad people, very dishonest people
trump, With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity
trump, Together, we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration
trump, We will continue to enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with those beautiful, beautiful words and phrase
trump, I love the phrase, Made in the USA
trump, Made in the USA
trump, We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America within now nine years
trump, We started a year ago
trump, Can you imagine that We're doing that, and it's going to happen
trump, Who would have thought we could have done that We will land the first woman on the moon and become the first nation in the world to plant our flag on Mars
trump, We will defend privacy, free speech, and you know this
trump, You know it's under siege, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms
trump, We will defend it
trump, It's under siege
trump, It's under siege
trump, You see it in Virginia
trump, They want to take away the guns
trump, Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one beautiful America
trump, We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States
trump, we stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement
trump, We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life
trump, We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the true American way
trump, We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag
trump, And we live by the words of our national motto In God We Trust
trump, From Tucson to Tombstone, right Do you agree You agree, right Look at him
trump, He's agreeing, this guy
trump, He's agreeing
trump, No more censorship is right
trump, No more evil
trump, No more crimes
trump, You're right
trump, From Yuma to Mesa and from Flagstaff to right here in Phoenix, we stand on the shoulders of red-blooded American Patriots who poured their heart, sweat, and soul to secure our liberty and to defend our freedom
trump, Arizona was founded by pioneers and prospectors, great prospectors, cowboys and miners and ranchers who tamed the wilderness, braved the blazing sun, and it is hot here
trump, I've been here during the summer
trump, I want to tell you, it's seriously hot
trump, Of course, didn't they say that President Clinton, when he went on the back of the plane was here to play golf, it was 121 degrees that day I don't know about that
trump, I don't know about that
trump, What do you think he was doing with the Attorney General I remember he said, Oh, I just happened to see she was … I was here to play golf
trump, It was 120 degrees out
trump, I don't know
trump, A lot of crooked stuff went on
trump, I wonder what they talked about
trump, I'm sure it wasn't that she would become a Supreme Court Justice
trump, I'm sure it wasn't that they were going to extend her tenure as Attorney General
trump, She was a real beauty
trump, I'm sure it wasn't
trump, I'm sure it was nothing
trump, They spent 45 minutes on the plane talking about golf and their grandchildren
trump, Right Can't let it happen, folks
trump, Can't let it happen
trump, We can't let it happen
trump, You fought the battles and helped make this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth, and we are making it greater every single day than ever before
trump, Great, great, great citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country
trump, We are returning power to you, the American people, with your help, your devotion and with your drive
trump, We are going to keep on working
trump, We are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning
trump, Do you like winning Because not very long ago you weren't winning, and I don't want you … I told this a few times during the campaign
trump, Haven't used it in a long time, but I don't want you going to your great governor
trump, He's a great governor, Doug Ducey
trump, I don't want you going to your governor saying, Governor, governor, we just can't stand winning so much
trump, Please go see the president in the oval office
trump, Governor, the people of Arizona don't want to keep on winning
trump, It's too much governor
trump, It's not even fair to the rest of the planet
trump, Please tell him, Governor Ducey, please tell him, ‘President, the people of Arizona have won too much
trump, We don't want to keep on winning
trump,' And I'll look at Doug Ducey, and I'll say, Doug, I've a lot of respect for you, Doug
trump, You won by 16 points
trump, That means a lot
trump, But Doug, I don't care what you say
trump, We're going to keep on winning, and we're going to win like never before
trump, And the people of Arizona are going to love it

trump,Doesn't have the power
trump, Doesn't have the staying power
trump, You see what's happening in California
trump, Blackouts, rolling blackouts
trump, How would you like that in Pennsylvania The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
trump, Darling, what's wrong I can't watch Trump on television
trump, I can't watch our president
trump, Darling, we have a rolling blackout
trump, It'll only be a few hours
trump, I think we'll be on by two o'clock in the morning, darling, and we can watch a rerun
trump, Now, this is what's happening
trump, You have rolling blackouts
trump, You have, in some cases, just blackouts
trump, I don't even call them rolling
trump, Not going to happen to your state
trump, Last year, I visited the Shell petrochemical plant in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, the largest investment in your state's history
trump, That was all made possible by our pro energy policies
trump, We've done it a lot
trump, In Louisiana, we're building some of the largest plants you've ever seen, largest in the world and it's incredible, all related to energy, but your security and your jobs are in very grave peril, because the radical left maniacs, they don't want to have anything to do with energy
trump, They don't want anything to do with, they have different concepts, right They have the green new deal, whether it will be no energy, almost of any kind
trump, No, it's crazy
trump, Thought of by AOC plus three
trump, You know AOC and she's got them
trump, She's radical left, but she's not as bad as some of them
trump, How about Omar of Minnesota We're going to win the state of Minnesota because of her, they say
trump, He's telling us how to run our country
trump, How did you do where you came from How is your country doing She's going to tell us, she's telling us how to run our country
trump, You know what The Democrats in Congress, you have to see what they are doing
trump, Their stance on Israel, it's like a whole different world
trump, It's like from 10 years ago, it's like a different world and we want to keep our world the way it was and the way it's going to be
trump, We've got the greatest country on earth and we're going to keep it that way
trump, We don't need socialist and we don't need communist telling us how to run our country
trump, I do this every night and a lot of times it's a waste
trump, I did it last night
trump, We were … Did you see the crowd we had last night We were in a great place, Ohio
trump, We had a crowd
trump, We had a crowd
trump, You couldn't see the end of it
trump, I said, Turn around camera, turn around
trump, But, they never liked doing that, you know They don't like spinning those cameras
trump, They don't want to show the crowd
trump, They don't like showing
trump, They don't like showing, show the crowd and this is … it's an honor
trump, Let me tell you
trump, Look, I used to think that was a difficulty like it was a new camera that can't turn, but then whenever there was like a problem, like there'd be a little argument or some kind of an anti-Trump person, you don't see that much
trump, I don't want to bring it on, but you don't see it much anymore
trump, You know why It's dangerous
trump, It's dangerous for them, but you know, I'd see the camera would never move, whenever where there's something like a little negative happening, that thing would turn around like a pretzel
trump, I said, Oh, it does move
trump, But, they never want to show the crowds
trump, They never, last night
trump, Now, I went home and I tell you this, I go home all the time
trump, First lady, How'd you like the crowd Sir, I didn't see it
trump, I didn't see it, but I didn't see it, Donald
trump, I didn't see it
trump, Sometimes she'll call me Mr
trump, President, but she's only kidding
trump, Believe me
trump, She's only kidding
trump, Has she been a great first lady, right She's been a great first lady and very popular
trump, She's really done a great job
trump, She works hard
trump, We have some great people here tonight
trump, I brought certain members of my family, but I'm going to introduce them to you in a little bit, okay Great family
trump, They work hard
trump, I'll tell you what, they work hard
trump, They really work hard
trump, But I do wish they would show because it would be, you know, it's actually better for them if they show
trump, It shows the importance
trump, The only thing you can do is show
trump, I'll say, How did it look I don't know how it looked, but the sound was phenomenal
trump, Okay It sounded like a Penn state football game like the Steelers football game
trump, You can't disguise it
trump, You ever see Sleepy Joe with the little circles Oh, you can
trump, He puts them very far away, so far away
trump, Then he comes up with the mask
trump, He's like a hundred yards from the nearest human being
trump, He's got a … He feels good about the mask
trump, I wonder in the debate it'll be him and I or the stage
trump, Is he going to walk in with a mask No, I think he'll come in with a mask
trump, I don't know
trump, I have no idea
trump, Well, the question is, will he leave it on during the debate Because it's a little hard and I'm all for mask when you need them, I'm up, but when you're making a speech and the nearest person's like where you are and you're in a stage all by yourself and then he had a habit of taking it off and it hangs down on his ear as he's speaking, it makes him feel comfortable
trump, Honestly, whatever makes you feel good is okay with me, but it'll be interesting
trump, I'm going to be, we're going to have a big rating on that
trump, He's been doing it all his life
trump, He's been doing it for 47 years and I've just started doing this stuff
trump, I'm just starting
trump, But, I'm just thinking, but I did it more in 47 months than he did in 47 years
trump, That's true
trump, That's true
trump, You look at what we've done
trump, No, it's true
trump, That's actually true
trump, He did a lot of negative stuff too
trump, You have to deduct that out
trump, When asked if there would be any place for fossil fuels, including coal and fracking in a Biden administration, Joe replied, No, we would make sure that it's all eliminated
trump, All of a sudden, he gets the nomination
trump, He's been trying to get the nomination for decades
trump, He finally get, and that was prime time for him, which was never great
trump, He never got more than 1
trump, We called it
trump, Remember, I called him his first nickname was 1 Joe
trump, Frankly, had Elizabeth Warren been loyal to her philosophy, which is radical left, socialism, perhaps communism
trump, I don't know, perhaps
trump, It's verging on communism, right But had she been loyal, she would've left
trump, She would have quit
trump, She had no chance
trump, She was out
trump, Pocahontas
trump, She was gone
trump, Remember, I said,  I have more Indian blood in me than you have and I have none
trump, I'd love to have some, but I don't happen to have any
trump, Then she choked and she went out and got a test
trump, She announced she had 1024th, right 1,000
trump, That means, like I said it last night, that means around 700 or 800 years ago, somewhere, there was a little bit of a relationship going and that's okay
trump, Seven, 800 years ago, maybe
trump, What a phony she is
trump, It's terrible
trump, Now, we're going to pick a great woman, any one of the five that I told you, but any one of the women that we had they're all great people, great scholars, great, brilliant people
trump, A lot of people
trump, 00 on Saturday at the White House
trump, You see, we have tremendous Republican support
trump, Two people
trump, Always got to be two
trump, Always got to be the two
trump, Those two
trump, We have great support from the Republican party, tremendous support
trump, It's never been this unified before ever, ever and the fake impeachment
trump, We had 196 to nothing Republican support
trump, We had 52 and a half to a half in the Senate
trump, Who is the half I can't imagine
trump, I can't
trump, Buddy was very good today
trump, I have to tell you, he was good
trump, Now, I'm happy
trump, Thank you, Mitt
trump, Thank you
trump, No, he was very good, very positive statement, but days ago, Biden reiterated his pledge to require net zero carbon emissions
trump, That's basically saying, you know what that is There'll be no more oil
trump, There'll be no more gas
trump, There'll be no more nothing
trump, There'll be no more industry
trump, There'll be no more country
trump, That's what it's like really
trump, That would instantly shut down all fracking and all mining immediately in Pennsylvania sending your jobs overseas, sending your money to somebody else, not you
trump, I'll keep your jobs in Pennsylvania where they belong and you're going to be doing fracking for a long time
trump, I can say the same because you are really big in energy
trump, I can say the same thing to you as I say in Texas
trump, So, they don't want oil
trump, They don't want fracking, right They don't want the energy that we know that powers these massive plants because the other stuff is wonderful
trump, It's not going to do it
trump, It's not going to do it
trump, So, they don't like oil
trump, They don't like the gas
trump, They don't like God, religion, churches are close
trump, How about these states They still have churches closed
trump, By the way, your governor hasn't been so great
trump, You know that, right Are your churches still closed They're still closed
trump, They're doing it for a reason
trump, By the way, November 4th, they'll announce, We've decided to open up
trump, Okay They're trying to make our numbers as bad as possible
trump, So, California's closed
trump, Pennsylvania's closed
trump, North Carolina's closed
trump, Michigan is closed
trump, That's another beauty right there, Michigan's closed
trump, Then they have these fake ballots, millions and millions of ballots
trump, By the way, when not if, when you see shenanigans, please report it to your authorities
trump, Okay The real authorities, they're watching and the authorities are watching, but please report it
trump, But when you look at it, really, it's amazing
trump, They're trying to make our numbers look bad, but even with numerous closed states and you notice also law and order, right Law and order, the red states, the Republican states, they're working great
trump, Record low crime, record low, but Democrat run states, you look at Chicago, you look at New York, New York has gone through a … We have to bring back
trump, We should draft Rudy Giuliani
trump, Okay Let's bring him back
trump, Draft Rudy
trump, We want Rudy
trump, Rudy, Rudy
trump, I'll tell you Rudy is amazing, but he did a great job
trump, New York was in big trouble
trump, He came in and he just was tough, smart, and it became the safest big city
trump, Now, we have a man where some categories of crime were up 300
trump, He fired 1,000
trump, He fired a lot of police, I guess, a billion dollars a year worth of police, worth of great police, firemen and women
trump, It's a terrible thing
trump, I love that place so much and it's so sad to see what's happening to New York
trump, We're going to make a little bit of a play for New York
trump, In theory, the Democrats automatically win New York, but I do phenomenally in most parts
trump, Then one part, it's automatic, but I can't imagine that particular part is going to be very happy
trump, So, we're going to make a play for New York
trump, With Pennsylvania, I don't have to make a play
trump, We've got Pennsylvania
trump, Just go out of here
trump, We don't have to make a play
trump, We don't have to
trump, It's a great, you know, for years though Pennsylvania was a place that Republicans just didn't win
trump, For many years, everybody thought they were going to win, every Republican
trump, So yeah, we're going to win Pennsylvania
trump, They thought they were going to win it and they didn't
trump, I came along and we won it and we won it quite easily
trump, Quite easy
trump, I think we're going to do even better now, because remember, number one in the history of your state last year, and that's because of what we did, we stopped the dumping
trump, We saved your stell
trump, So many different things, but Pennsylvania is the home of American energy
trump, Think of it that way
trump, This has taken place over a very short period of time
trump, Also, the birthplace of a thing called the American constitution
trump, Right American constitution
trump, To uphold our constitution as written as opposed to as conceived by some radical left judge, I will soon be announcing that nominee
trump, You're going to love it
trump, You're going to be so happy
trump, If you don't love it, don't vote for me
trump, Okay You don't like it
trump, My opponent refuses to release a list of justices
trump, I was told that a big thing when I was running last time, nobody really knew me
trump, They knew me very well
trump, We had great success at The Apprentice and in business and it was great, but they never knew what kind of a judge I would pick or to be a justice, right A justice of the Supreme Court
trump, I said, I mean, what am I going to do How am I going to solve that problem But, I was in politics, never
trump, Don't forget, when I ran, they said, No, he's inexperienced
trump, I ran against some very talented people
trump, Some of whom are very good friends of mine
trump, Some of whom I don't like too much
trump, When I don't like somebody, it last for a long time, but I said, Well, how do we solve that problem I don't know
trump, They just weren't believing
trump, The appointment of a- Just weren't believing
trump, The appointment of a United States Supreme Court justice was much more important to the voters than I thought
trump, And they're right, because they will set policy for 50 years and they'll set policy, whether it's life, whether it's second amendment
trump, The second amendment, if I weren't president, you know the pressure, your second amendment would be obliterated
trump, It would maybe be gone, but at a minimum obliterated, they haven't touched your second amendment
trump, Not even touched it
trump, Because I'm here to block
trump, I'm a blocking force
trump, I'm like a lineman for the Pittsburgh Steelers
trump, I'm a blocking force
trump, No, they haven't touched it
trump, But your second amendment would be under siege
trump, So nobody knew
trump, I never knew
trump, You hear about Supreme Court, you know about Supreme Court, you know about other judges, by the way at the end of the first term, we'll be close to 300 federal judges, including court of appeals, which I think is a record
trump, I guess it's a record
trump, It's a lot
trump, That's a lot
trump, Nobody's done that
trump, It's record
trump, Think of that
trump, 300
trump, That's a big percentage of the entire judiciary
trump, Think of that
trump, 300
trump, And many, many court of appeals judges, but two great Supreme Court judges or justices
trump, And now we're going to get a third
trump, Can you imagine our enemies Three in one term
trump, So many presidents, they just don't have the chance and it's so important
trump, But I said to my people, I said, so if they don't believe me, what I'll do is I'll make up a list of 25 judges or people and we'll tell them, I will only pick from that list
trump, They said, That sounds like an interesting idea
trump, This was my idea
trump, When you've never run for office before you have to have a little bit of imagination
trump, So I got out a list, I named the people, the people are good, and I said, And I promise that I will pick someone like the people on this list
trump, And it didn't work
trump, It went nowhere because they didn't trust it
trump, They said, We want you to pick the people on the list, not somebody like the people on the list
trump, So I went back the next week, I said, I will pick somebody that's on this list
trump, And they were all great, great judges for the most part, I think almost entirely, but judges and really respected conservative believers in our country, solid, incredible people
trump, And as soon as I did that, things went through the roof
trump, It was amazing how important it was
trump, By the way, would you stand up with that beautiful jacket I love this guy
trump, How many times- How many events He's been to a couple
trump, That's really great
trump, Thank you very much
trump, I've seen him before
trump, He's been here a couple of times, like about 90
trump, Thank you, man
trump, That's really nice
trump, I'm going to get one of those jackets
trump, By the way, the wall
trump, The wall, yeah, 330 miles
trump, 330 miles
trump, 330 miles
trump, And yes, we have a great relationship with Mexico
trump, First they said, He'll never be able to build it
trump, The Democrats were just brutal
trump, I made a terrible mistake, I said it last night, I should have said, We will not under any circumstances build a wall at our Southern border
trump, They would have given me all the money in the world
trump, But stupidly, I said, We will build a wall
trump, And the Democrats said, Let's not give it to him
trump, But we got it, we won
trump, We won court cases, we won court cases
trump, I won so much money we could build four walls if we wanted
trump, So then they said, All right, all right
trump, They've lost
trump, So by the way, we're up to 330, the exact wall
trump, Their dream choice
trump, I said to the border patrol, I love these people, they're great, ICE, the border patrol, what they do is incredible
trump, They're incredible
trump, I said, Give me your dream wall, as long as we're building we might as well build a wall that you want
trump, Let's build it right
trump, Sir, we have to have vision
trump, We need steel and concrete
trump, I said, How about one or the other They said, No, sir, we need steel and concrete
trump, We need steel
trump, Inside those poles we have rebar and we have concrete and they're 30 feet tall
trump, We need all sorts of things
trump, We need them to be wired
trump, I won't tell you why they're wired, but they're wired for a reason
trump, They're all wired up and they're incredible
trump, But you know what We got the wall
trump, Nobody could have done it
trump, So once we had the wall and it started going up and then we hit a hundred miles, 200 miles, now we're at 330, and we're building 10 miles a week and it'll be finished very soon
trump, And we have the most secure border in terms of drug trafficking, trafficking coming along and we've done phenomenally well
trump, Because that's a lot of the territory that we need
trump, We're going to go up to probably a little bit over 500 miles, so we're at 330
trump, But once they saw that I had it, they said, Yeah, but Mexico's not paying for it
trump, But they are paying for it, Mexico's paying for the wall
trump, They are paying for it
trump, They're paying at the border
trump, They're paying for the wall
trump, All those trucks that go back and forth
trump, They're paying for the wall
trump, So the Democrats said, Yeah, but Mexico…, they always have to find something, right And do you remember what I used to say that if they fight us, remember people would say, What happens if they fight you on the wall What happens if they fight you right to hell on the wall I said, The wall would get 10 feet taller
trump, Took a little hit on that, we took a little bit of a hit, but that's okay
trump, The wall is a tall sucker, you don't want to get up to the top
trump, They look down, they say, Oh, ye, ye, how do we get down off this It's tall and it's strong and it's great
trump, And we appreciate, because Mexico has been working with us very closely
trump, They have right now 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our Southern border making sure that people don't come into our country
trump, I want to thank the president of Mexico
trump, Very helpful
trump, So I made this list of potential justices and I'll tell you, it all changed
trump, Now I'm asking sleepy Joe Biden to give me a list and he doesn't want to do it
trump, You know why Because he can only put super radical left judges on, people that would destroy our country, people that would destroy your country
trump, And he knows that he's not electable… He shouldn't be electable anyway
trump, This is the worst candidate
trump, You know where he is today They have a thing called the LID
trump, I don't even know
trump, Do you know what LID stands for LID
trump, He put out a LID today early in the morning
trump, LID means he's not going to be anywhere today
trump, I'm working my ass off, I'm in Ohio, I'm in Texas, I'm in Florida, I'm in Michigan, I'm in Wisconsin
trump, Man
trump, Thank you
trump, That's so nice
trump, Well, that is something that one of the fake news reporters back there, they said they've never heard of that one
trump, There was a chant that's going over the last six or seven rallies saying, ‘We love you
trump,' That's never happened to a politician before
trump, Am I a politician I don't want to be a politician
trump, I don't think of myself as a politician
trump, But it really is, I appreciate it
trump, I've never heard it
trump, I liked Ronald Reagan, but they never said we love you, or maybe they did
trump, They're going to try and find out
trump, Then they'll say, President Trump lied last night because 40 years ago I remember… But no, nobody's ever heard that one before and I appreciate it because it is reciprocal
trump, Thank you very much
trump, Reciprocal
trump, Reciprocal love
trump, It's reciprocal
trump, I had such a nice life before I did this
trump, I had such a nice life
trump, Then I had the witch hunt that goes on forever
trump, It goes on
trump, And then we catch them spying on our campaign
trump, How about that Let's see what happens though
trump, But we caught them spying, all of that, the whole big deal
trump, And then the guys that were doing the investigation, they have their 31 different phones, they were accidentally wiped clean
trump, 31 different phones, I think it was like 19 different people, and they all did the same exact accident
trump, Which if you knew anything about phones, it's almost an impossibility to do it once
trump, Let alone 31 different times
trump, So we caught them and that's called obstruction
trump, We have to remember that's called obstruction
trump, That was the Mueller group
trump, That was a Mueller group
trump, All those phones, they were wiped so clean
trump, And Hillary got a subpoena on the 30
trump, I said, Forget about these things because you'll find them
trump, They have them
trump, They're in the state department
trump, I have no doubt about it, they're in the state department but they'll get them
trump, But you know what 33,000, they have a request from the US Congress, that's not bad, US Congress they send a subpoena, very, very important, and after getting the subpoena, she deleted all of her emails and acid washed, and then she took her telephones
trump, I've gotten rid of phones too
trump, I throw them away
trump, She took cameras and she beat the hell out of them with a hammer and then threw them away
trump, And they found a couple of them
trump, She was very angry, obviously, if she did the hammer work
trump, But if anyone else said this, there's a protection, there's a dual level of justice, but we're getting down to the bottom of it because it's not fair to us
trump, Not fair to us
trump, 33,000 emails
trump, She deleted them on the basis that it was all about her daughter's wedding, Chelsea, and also yoga classes
trump, 33,000 emails on yoga and a wedding
trump, I don't think so
trump, And Comey said, Oh, that's okay
trump, That sounds like a good reason
trump, That's Comey
trump, That's another beauty right there that Comey
trump, But we caught him, we caught him
trump, Very smart move
trump, Getting rid of that guy was a smart move, but we caught him
trump, Listen, we caught him
trump, They were spying on the campaign, they were doing actually worse than that
trump, Nobody's ever done a thing like this, so let's see what happens
trump, But we caught him cold, we got so much stuff
trump, Remember the insurance policy, right From Strzok and Page, two lovers
trump, They were very smart
trump, They would use the public servers and send it over the public wires because they didn't want to be caught having an affair
trump, So they went over the public
trump, That was a very good thing for us
trump, Wasn't it  Darling, darling, darling, please
trump, She's going to win
trump, She's going to win, isn't she Peter, Peter only you can save us
trump, Peter, she's going to win
trump, Yes, darling
trump, She's going to win
trump, I know
trump, 100,000 to nothing
trump, Remember that It was actually 100 million to one
trump, This was a hundred million to one
trump, This is this idiot
trump, So listen, So darling, please, please tell me again
trump, Yes, 100 million to one she's going to win
trump, But just in case she doesn't, we have an insurance policy
trump, Now that only means one thing
trump, And we went through the insurance policy and we caught them
trump, So let's see what happens to these treasonous crooks
trump, These terrible people
trump, And they put our nation through turmoil
trump, But I just want to thank… A lot of people were very unfairly treated
trump, You look at General Flynn, look, he's still going through it
trump, Can you believe it But a lot of people were unfairly treated by a bunch of treasonous, horrible people
trump, And they used the intelligence agencies of our country to try and steal an election and to try and do a coup
trump, Wouldn't you think Who would ever think this country… But that's all you can say
trump, Some people would say, Well, that's a conspiracy theory
trump, No, just take a look at the records
trump, For me, it's a very exciting thing because we found something that nobody would have thought possible
trump, Now let's see what happens
trump, But we have them cold, they spied on our campaign
trump, It's our campaign And if you want to save America, you have to go out, get out and vote
trump, This is the most important election
trump, In just three and a half years we've secured America's borders, which makes them very unhappy, rebuilt the awesome power of the US military, we built the military
trump, It was totally depleted when I took over
trump, We built a military
trump, Two and a half trillion dollars we spent, all made in the USA, the greatest equipment, the greatest planes and rockets and missiles and our nuclear
trump, I hate to even mention the word and hope to God we never have to use it, but we have the most powerful weapons in the history of the world
trump, And we did that over a very short period of time
trump, Weapons that are so powerful that we're the envy of the world, but I never want to use those weapons
trump, And hopefully we'll never have to
trump, You know the way you don't have to use them, is when you have them
trump, It's when you have them
trump, But nobody's ever built force like what we have
trump, And the newspapers and the press and the fake news they went and said, He just gave away classified information I said, No, I will look you right in the eye, first of all, I'm allowed to do it, I'm the president, so I'm allowed to actually
trump, I'm the only one that's allowed to
trump, But no, no, I didn't give away
trump, I'm just telling you, most powerful weapons ever produced we have, and other countries know that
trump, And it's a good thing that they know it and I don't think we'll ever be using them
trump, And I hope we don't
trump, I hope to God
trump, I use the word God, because they refuse to use the word God in their pledge of allegiance, right Twice
trump, I use the word God
trump, I hope to God, we never have to use them
trump, But I obliterated the ISIS caliphate, which was all over the place
trump, 100
trump, Remember I got it down to 99
trump, They said, You got to go a hundred
trump, I said, Let's get out of here
trump, We're bringing them all back home
trump, Everyone's coming back home
trump, Long, long wars
trump, The never ending wars, the endless wars
trump, We fixed our disastrous trade deals, they were a disaster, brought jobs and factories back to Pennsylvania under 16 years
trump, And think of this, for 16 years presidents, Obama, President Bush, household income rose 2,945
trump, That's over a 16 year period
trump, In three years, your household income rose almost 10,000
trump, When you include energy
trump, You have to include energy
trump, Without energy, almost 7,000
trump, But we have to include energy
trump, I mean, how much are you paying for your gasoline You never saw 2 gasoline
trump, Less, right It's less
trump, They go up, it's less
trump, It's a big difference
trump, What is it nowadays Come on, tell me
trump, I haven't got any gas
trump, I haven't stopped recently at a gas station
trump, 15 Okay
trump, Because for a while it was way under two
trump, And we're going to keep it there
trump, We have so much, we have so much
trump, In my first three years we lifted 6
trump,6 million people out of poverty, the largest poverty reduction in the history of our country, by far
trump, We built the greatest economy in the history of the world
trump, And right now we're doing it again
trump, I see all these hats, Make America Great Again
trump, And now I'm going to say this, Make America Great Again, Again
trump, Make America Great Again, Again, Again
trump, We saved 1
trump,4 million jobs in Pennsylvania alone and to fight the China virus, it's the China virus, not the coronavirus
trump, Corona sounds like a place in Italy, a beautiful place
trump, It's corona
trump, No, it's the China virus
trump, They don't want to say it
trump, The radical left, they don't want to say it
trump, You ever notice they're always going to have to Russia
trump, Look, nobody's been tougher on Russia than me
trump, Russia, Russia, Russia
trump, I said, What about China They never going to to mention it
trump, They got little deals going on I think
trump, But coronavirus, doesn't it sound like Italy A beautiful villa
trump, Corona
trump, No, it's a China virus
trump, They should have stopped it
trump, To fight the China virus we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II
trump, We did an A+ job, except we did a D job in terms of public relations, explaining it because we were too busy doing it
trump, But the fact is they wouldn't have written it anyway
trump, It didn't matter to them
trump, It's there
trump, It's their little thing
trump, You have a watch Biden He can't talk about it he thinks, so he gets up, The coronavirus, they say, We want to talk about Supreme Court judge today
trump, Well, I don't know about that
trump, The coronavirus
trump, And he doesn't know we did a great job, he has no clue
trump, He said, I should have opened
trump, He goes, I should have shut down one week earlier
trump, What he doesn't say is he did the worst job in the history of an epidemic or a pandemic with the swine flu
trump, It was a joke
trump, And what he did, his own man, that was in charge said recently, We had no idea what the hell we were doing
trump, It was a total disaster
trump, There were amateurs
trump, And now he tells us how to do something that's far more lethal
trump, But he said,  They should have closed one week early, except when it came to closing the border, which I did, which turned out to save tens of thousands of lives, Biden criticized me until two months later when he said I was right
trump, But we should have closed a weak earlier
trump, Think of that
trump, We pioneered lifesaving therapies, reducing the fatality rate 85 since April
trump, Think of that
trump, Remdesivir, the plasmas, we have among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country
trump, Nobody knows that
trump, And I am devastated to see it happening, but you see what's going on in Europe again
trump, They were always saying, Oh, Europe is doing better
trump, Actually we did better, but now Europe has a big spike, a big spike
trump, So they're not talking about that
trump, The number of hospitalized virus patients is down by 47 and virus patients coming to the emergency room is down and visits are way down, visits to hospital
trump, Europe has almost a 50 greater excess mortality rate than the United States
trump, They're liking to compare us to Europe
trump, 50 greater excess mortality rate
trump, Our early and aggressive action saved millions of lives through Operation Warp Speed
trump, You've heard about it, they don't want to talk about it
trump, What we've done in a record period of time with the ventilators, now we're building ventilators for the world
trump, Very hard to do
trump, We'll develop and distribute a vaccine very, very shortly in record time, it would have been two or three years, four years, if Biden's group had done it, but we've done a great job with the FDA in clearing a path and you'll be seeing it very shortly
trump, And these are great companies that are doing it
trump, So we'll crush the virus and our opponents will, with him, they will crush America
trump, We can't let it happen
trump, This country is too great
trump, Our love of each other is too great
trump, This guy doesn't know he's alive
trump, He really doesn't
trump, He doesn't know he's alive
trump, He did an ad on an anonymous source that said about me making a statement about military soldiers that died
trump, And it was such a disgusting thing
trump, I said, The only good thing about it is now I can take the gloves off
trump, This guy doesn't have a clue
trump, He doesn't know where the hell he is and they'll give him a shot of something
trump, I don't know, he's going to get something
trump, Because I watched him so badly, he performed so badly in the debates, and then with Bernie, he was average, not great, but he got through and I said, What the hell is he taking And we'd like to ask him
trump, And I said that, We want a drug test, we want a drug test
trump, We'll both take it
trump, We'll both take it
trump, Because with Bernie he was able to get through
trump, But listen, it wasn't Winston Churchill
trump, This wasn't the greatest, but he got through, it was fine
trump, Him and Bernie screaming at each other, mostly Bernie
trump, Crazy Bernie
trump, He's not too happy
trump, I'll tell you, did you ever see a better loser than Bernie though Seriously
trump, He's a good loser
trump, He got terribly treated by Hillary and that group
trump, And then it happened again with Elizabeth Warren, right It happened again
trump, What the Democrat party did to him
trump, And then you have this guy, Mike Bloomberg, mini Mike, one question and he was gone
trump, There goes 1
trump,8 billion out their window
trump, I said, You think it's easy up here, Mike, don't ya One question and that was the end
trump, He said, Where am I Get me the hell off of this platform
trump, Mini Mike, mini Mike
trump, So now he's trying to buy into the party
trump, You would think after the way they treated him, they called him every name, Pocahontas destroyed him, she didn't do good against me, but boy did she do good against Mini Mike
trump, I figured he'd be calling and saying, Listen, I want to become a Republican
trump, We've done great for the economy, you'd think
trump, But he always wanted to run for president, and he tried before, I guess, but he tried and it was a bad experience
trump, And you would think he would have joined our party
trump, But instead he's trying to buy his way back in
trump, When somebody treats you that way, even stay neutral, don't go back in
trump, He wants to give them a lot of money to try and buy their friendship
trump, And one thing you learned about politics, I spent a fraction of the money that crooked Hillary spent
trump, They raised 2 billion
trump, I spent my own money, but I spent a fraction of the money… I spent my own money, but I spent a fraction of the money, like 35, 30, and we won
trump, Nobody ever says that
trump, It's not about money
trump, It's about other things
trump, There are other things involved
trump, It's not just about money
trump, In the old days, my father would teach me, If you can win and spend less, that's a good thing
trump, I remember after I won and I won decisively look, 306 to 223
trump, That's a lot
trump, 306 delegates, 306, that's decisive
trump, We won Michigan and we're going to win it again
trump, We're up in a poll just now
trump, Oh, they're going crazy
trump, They're going crazy
trump, We won Wisconsin
trump, We won Pennsylvania
trump, But my father taught me
trump, He said, If you can win and spend less money, that's a good thing, not a bad thing
trump, That's a good thing, not a bad thing
trump, Like if you get along with the leaders of other lands and don't go to war all the time with everybody and can come out on top without having to shed blood all over the place and destroy your families and your country, like when I get along with Putin, when I get along with Kim Jong-un
trump, Whatever happened to the war we were supposed to be in with North Korea Nothing happened
trump, They said I gave away so much
trump, I said, What did I give away They couldn't find that anything
trump, I didn't do anything
trump, They said, You met
trump, Oh, I met
trump, Oh, okay
trump, I met
trump, Now you would have been in war with her
trump, You would have been in war
trump, But if you can spend, think of this, if you can spend less money and win, that's a good thing
trump, So after I won one of these people back there, right back there- … in order to keep the thing going on Trump, I had won, he said, But Trump raised substantially less money than crooked Hillary Clinton
trump, That's because I didn't need the money
trump, I didn't need the money
trump, I can call up a lot of rich guys that raised a lot of money, but I feel uncomfortable doing it because when you do that, it's like you're sort of … It's not the same
trump, I could call up every guy
trump, They call me up and they say, Sir, how are you, sir Mr
trump, President, sir
trump, I have friends see
trump, I don't have too many friends up because I used to be comfortable
trump, You have to be comfortable with people, right I have friends, I have one friend, Richard
trump, I talk about him all the time, but multiply this times a hundred people
trump, Richard used to call me up five, six years ago
trump, Hey, let's have dinner
trump, All right
trump, Where do you want to go I don't know
trump, Go to some crazy restaurant
trump, Today the restaurants are all closed in New York
trump, They don't want to open them
trump, They want to make them do badly until November but don't worry, they're opening in November 4th
trump, But it's true
trump, So, it's Richard on the phone, Richard, my friend for many, many years
trump, I said, Hey Richard, how are you doing Mr
trump, President sir, how are you I said, Well …  He's been calling Donnie and Don and DJ, and all
trump, Richard, are you okay Everything good Yes, sir
trump, Mr
trump, President, sir
trump, You're doing a great job and I'd like to thank you
trump, Good, Richard
trump, Richard, loosen up please
trump, You don't have to call me Mr
trump, Parson
trump, I said, Just call me Donald
trump, It's okay
trump, Thank you Donald
trump, I really appreciate it
trump, And you hear the guy can't breathe
trump, He's having a hard time breathing
trump, He's very nervous
trump, Then at the end of the phone, he goes, Mr
trump, President again, thank you so much for the job you do, and he hangs up
trump, I said, how can you be friends with …  It just doesn't work
trump, It's like, I've lost a lot of people this way
trump, It's called respect for the office
trump, They have respect for the office
trump, They really do
trump, Nothing wrong with it
trump, I sort of understand that
trump, They have respect for the office
trump, Nobody has more respect for this offices than I do
trump, That's why I'm doing a great job, and I'll always do a great job
trump, It's respect for the office
trump, But on November 3rd, Pennsylvania, will decide whether we end the pandemic, defeat the virus and return to record prosperity just like we were before, or whether we allow sleepy Joe Biden, who doesn't have a clue, to kill the recovery, raise your taxes, delay the vaccine
trump, So he wants to impose a 4 trillion tax
trump, Do you believe 4 trillion
trump, Ban American energy, which means what Hey, let's go back
trump, Let's call up the Middle East and let's be real nice to them because we need their energy
trump, No, thank you
trump, Destroy your suburbs
trump, You know, I got rid of this regulation that was going to destroy your suburbs
trump, Destroy your suburbs
trump, I call it the Obama Regulates
trump, They're building nice projects right next to your beautiful home
trump, Lots of luck
trump, Give free healthcare
trump, I hope the people in the suburbs … When I did this, I took a lot of heat
trump, I got rid of a regulation
trump, They all said, Sir, we'll amend the regulation
trump, We're going to amend it
trump, I said, I don't want to amend it
trump, A couple of stories where written
trump, I wish the women living in the suburbs would read these stories
trump, They were written by people that say, I can't believe a president had the guts to do it
trump, I did because I want to save the American dream
trump, By the way, a big part of the American dream are minorities who made it and they want to live in the suburbs and they don't want to be next to a project
trump, Remember Sleepy Joe
trump, He'll do it because he has no choice because they have total power
trump, He's like a puppet for them and indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-American lies
trump, To combat the toxic left wing propaganda in our schools, I announced last week that we are launching a new pro-American lesson plan for students called 1776 Commission
trump, We will teach our children the truth about America, that we are the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth and getting better every single day
trump, We're not going to let it fail
trump, The Democrat party has joined forces with flag burners, anarchists, anti-police people, they're extremist
trump, Agitators
trump, And then they say, Oh no, no, this was a peaceful protest
trump, This is a peaceful protest
trump, They know what I'm talking about
trump, They know our great uniform
trump, Brilliant
trump, We love them, but you know what We call it a peaceful protest now, because the only thing you're allowed to do in Pennsylvania, can't go to church, right You can't meet, you can't congregate
trump, You can't look at each other
trump, You can't give your wife a kiss goodnight
trump, You've got to wear a mask
trump, You can't do anything
trump, They got you closed up
trump, Don't go out to dinner, stay where you are
trump, Michigan, same thing like the governor
trump, Her husband went boating
trump, It was a disaster because nobody's allowed
trump, He was the only boat
trump, He had this massive, beautiful lake
trump, You know the lake I'm talking about
trump, It's a big lake
trump, They've got to be able to do their job
trump, You've got to let them do their job
trump, Got to be able to do your job, right They let you do your job, you'd see
trump, You'd see Pennsylvania, not some big, bad crime numbers in your state
trump, You let them do your job
trump, Any state, New York's finest
trump, By the way, I got endorsed by New York's finest
trump, First time they've ever endorsed
trump, And you know that's hard when you have radical left running the city, all politicians, the mayor
trump, I got endorsed by the Chicago Police
trump, Can you imagine that I got endorsed by Oklahoma and I got endorsed by Texas and Louisiana
trump, I got endorsed by Florida, the sheriffs
trump, All the sheriffs got together, they endorsed Trump
trump, I got endorsed by law enforcement, everybody
trump, But how could you possibly endorse people that hate you and don't respect the job you do, and don't let you do your job most importantly Because if they let you do what you do better than anybody else in the world, you wouldn't have problems
trump, These are other police departments
trump, You look at Seattle
trump, We said we're going in, and they immediately said, We'll put up our hands
trump, It was so easy
trump, We were going in the following day
trump, You look at Portland
trump, How about Portland It's like an anarchist's dream
trump, We're dealing with the governor, because you know, I hate to say it, but they're all Democrat-run cities and states
trump, All of them, every single one
trump, The Republicans are doing great, but they have to ask
trump, By law, they have to ask us to go in
trump, But do you remember that beautiful day It was 10 days late
trump, You had these people from CNN and other places
trump, These are friendly protests
trump, That's a lovely thing to say
trump, As he's getting rocks and cans of tuna fish
trump, They go out to buy tuna fish and soup
trump, You know that, right Goya
trump, I hope Goya, he's great, isn't he Good guy
trump, They go out and buy Goya because they throw it
trump, They throw it
trump, It's the perfect weight, tuna fish they can really rip it, and that hits you
trump, No, it's true
trump, Bumblebee brand tuna, and you can throw it at soccer, you can a curve on it
trump, You can do whatever else you want
trump, The cops in Chicago, you saw, they're going like this
trump, It was terrible
trump, They're not allowed to fight back
trump, They're not allowed to fight back
trump, These guys if they fight back, nobody's going to be there very long throwing things
trump, But they're professionals, they're anarchists
trump, They're paid for by outside stupid rich people that … They're stupid people
trump, By the way, you know the first ones that get wiped out They don't have a shot by the way, I'll tell you that, but if they ever did, the first ones that would get wiped out are the stupid people that gave them the money to do this stuff
trump, Those are the people that would get wiped out
trump, But you know, they're very smart
trump, Everything is perfect
trump, Do you ever see where they drop the bricks along the thing in a bag Then they drop, everyone picks them up, throws them at our great police
trump, We're not going to let that stuff happen, but this is all a Democrat
trump, It doesn't happen with Republicans
trump, I was with Greg Abbott
trump, I was with Ron DeSantis, Texas and Florida and other governors that can't even believe a thing like that could happen, but they get caught
trump, They're walking up
trump, There're like 30 cans of soup
trump, They have like 25 cans of tuna
trump, They get caught
trump, I'm bringing this home to my family
trump, How dare you stop me No, no, no
trump, They use it as ammunition
trump, It's terrible shame
trump, But he went down and he didn't like it
trump, He was hit
trump, Police brutality
trump, You remember that They walked in, and they've got the tear gas
trump, They've got everything you can possibly have
trump, Pepper spray
trump, They don't want you to use tear gas anymore
trump, In some places like I think in Milwaukee, they said no tear gas, no pepper spray
trump, How the hell do you keep big crowds back You can't
trump, So the police all quit
trump, They all quit
trump, They said, We can't do it
trump, But you remember, they went out and you had one, then you had two, three, four, then you had five, six, seven
trump, All of a sudden they started pouring in
trump, They were getting off the buses
trump, They came from a different locale, and then you had a line of them and there was no social distancing unfortunately
trump, In fact, I was going to turn them in because they were right next to each other
trump, They were right next to each other
trump, They were touching arms and they had big, strong arms like these guys right over here
trump, There were big strong guys
trump, That's all right
trump, They were like together
trump, Then you saw the first line
trump, Then you saw the second line, then you saw a third line, and then you saw a fourth line
trump, Then they said, March
trump, They never halted
trump, Just walked right through, cleaned everything up, and Minneapolis was cured
trump, They were cured
trump, They grabbed them
trump, They grabbed them
trump, They grabbed them
trump, They were grabbing them left and right
trump, Sometimes they grabbed, they grabbed one guy, I'm a reporter
trump, I'm a reporter
trump, Get out of here
trump, They throw him aside like he was a little bag of popcorn
trump, But no, but I mean, honestly, when you watch the crap that we've all had to take so long, when you see that, it's actually … You don't want to do that, but when you see it, it's actually a beautiful sight
trump, It's a beautiful sight
trump, Behind him was like 10 blocks of fire was … I'd never
trump, It's a classic
trump, I don't know
trump, Anybody, you know what I'm talking about Is it … So, I just have such respect, but you have to let these great professionals do what they do best
trump, You have to let them do what they … It's called law and order
trump, We need law and order
trump, So, Democrat phenomena
trump, If they win, Sleepy Joe, if they win, because he has no power over these people, these people are crazed lunatics
trump, If they win, your cities will be like this
trump, You'll lose all rights
trump, Your constitution will be worthless
trump, It'll be a terrible, terrible thing
trump, I'm not even sure that, after some time listening to that and going along with it, I'm not even sure the country can ever recover
trump, That's how bad it would be
trump, I'm not sure it could ever recover
trump, Over Labor Day
trump, Left-wing radicals rampaged through Pittsburgh, harassing diners at restaurants
trump, I saw that one
trump, That was horrible
trump, No, I saw that, right I saw that
trump, That one guy grabs a woman, a older woman, she's eating a steak
trump, He grabbed the steak and started eating it, then he threw it back on the plate
trump, An outdoor place, and her husband standing there like they're afraid for their lives
trump, It was a terrible thing, and should never be allowed to happen
trump, A thing like that should just be closed up before it ever gets started
trump, That was terrible
trump, Remember that An older woman
trump, Last week after a police officer shot a knife-wielding assailant, over 100 rioters rampaged in Lancaster
trump, Went to school right nearby
trump, Looting businesses, setting fires and assaulting police offices with rocks and bricks and glass
trump, You saw that
trump, Joe Biden has the support of violent left wing extremists
trump, He never once mentioned the words law and order during their entire Democrat National Convention
trump, Never once
trump, They didn't talk about the riots, they didn't talk about anything having to do with law and order and respect and our great police
trump, They didn't do it
trump, They didn't talk about it
trump, It's not a subject
trump, They will rip your cities apart and they will go to your suburbs for all of those people in the suburbs that are ready to go about, they will go to your suburbs next
trump, I have the support of America's law enforcement heroes
trump, I was recently honored to be endorsed by the largest group of police and police representatives in the country
trump, We're endorsed by everybody
trump, We're joined by Butler County Mike Slupe
trump, Thank you, Mike, as well as two sheriffs who just changed their registrations, oh that's nice, to become Republicans

trump, Oh, did you hear today They want to impeach me again
trump, They said, if I submit the name of one of the most talented people in the world to be a justice of the Supreme Court, they want to impeach me
trump, They want to impeach me if I'm following the constitution
trump, No, think of it
trump, This is crazy Nancy

trump, You know crying Chuck He cries every time he thinks it's appropriate
trump, Now, I'll tell you what
trump, This Conor lamb turned out to be a stonecold phony
trump, When he was running … It's a very Trump … they like me
trump, I thought he was a Republican because his ads were so good
trump, We have to respect our president
trump, We have …  I said, This guy's doing some beautiful ads, and then I found out he was a Democrat
trump, I'll tell you what
trump, He's nothing compared to Sean
trump, Sean is the real deal
trump, Thank you so much
trump, Just give a little hand, because he's done a hell of a job too
trump, Our campaign chair, Bernie Comfort
trump, Thank you, Bernie
trump, Bernie Comfort
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you to Bernie Comfort
trump, Thanks, Bern
trump, All right
trump, While you guys are standing behind me like a beautiful curtain there … Well they're not blocking Air Force One so we could … But I have a woman with us tonight who has devoted so much
trump, She gave up her business
trump, She said, Dad, I'm going to come to Washington and help you
trump, I love you daddy, and we're going to help people
trump, I don't care and …  She was very successful in every way, and it's my daughter Ivanka
trump, I just want to thank this group of people
trump, And a man that helped, we just negotiated a major peace deal in the Middle East
trump, Everyone said it was impossible
trump, You know that, right They said it's impossible
trump, They've been killing everybody for years and years, they had this guy, John Kerry, who's grossly incompetent
trump, They paid 150 billion to Iran, they paid 1
trump,8 billion in cash
trump, That's even more impressive, frankly, in cash, that's John Kerry
trump, And we just made a deal with Bahrain and UAE, United Arab Emirates, and Israel, and it's a great thing
trump, And the man right there, Jared, the abuse, the abuse he takes, but he did something that nobody's been able to do, and he wants none of the glory, he'd rather not come up here
trump, These guys will come up 100
trump, Jared, great deal, great job
trump, Incredible
trump, Everyone's talking about it
trump, We have plenty of other countries going to join and there's no blood in the sand
trump, Okay
trump, Thanks honey
trump, Thank you
trump, Great people
trump, Thank you, Sean
trump, Thank you, Sean
trump, We have spent the last four years reversing the damage that Joe Biden inflicted over the last 40
trump, They like Sean
trump, Sean, will you please win Sean Parnell
trump, I'll tell you, he's popular
trump, That's great, Sean
trump, We love Sean
trump, But Biden championed every globalist portrayal of Pennsylvania for half a century, he was a cheerleader for the worst trade deal ever made by any country, NAFTA and China's entry into the world trade organization, which built China like a rocket ship
trump, They were flat lined for many, many decades and then right through the roof, that was a Biden approval
trump, These disasters ripped out one third of your state's manufacturing jobs
trump, You know what happened
trump, Biden shouldn't be asking for your vote, he should be begging for your forgiveness
trump, He did a terrible job
trump, Now the Democrat party is pledging to rejoin the disastrous Paris Climate Accord
trump, You want to spend a lot of money for nothing Eviscerating your state's economy, you will spend a trillion dollars and what it is really, it takes away your power, it takes away your energy
trump, You'll be closing your plants and factories all over the place
trump, I withdrew from it
trump, And you know what, the people that understand, the smart people, they said, I can't believe you had the guts to do it
trump, And I figured I was going to be absolutely killed on this one
trump, And you know what, I'm so proud I did it and people get it
trump, It was a rip off of the United States
trump, I withdrew from the catastrophe because I was elected to fight for Pittsburgh, not for Paris
trump, This election is a choice between Pennsylvania and China, if Biden wins, China wins
trump, When we win, Pennsylvania wins and America wins
trump, For decades, our politicians spent trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars that never ended and defending foreign borders
trump, But now we're finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities and we are bringing our jobs, our factories, and our troops, back home in the USA where they belong
trump, All coming home
trump, During the pandemic, I've suspended the entry of foreign workers who threatened American jobs
trump, As our economy reopens, I want to ensure that Americans are first in line to get the great jobs and the high wages
trump, America first
trump, Biden wants to flood the economy with cheap labor to replace US workers
trump, You know that
trump, And that's why never, never, I see his say, hire American
trump, He got it for me, all the words he's got there, are my words, right Do you ever see it They say he copied my campaign
trump, I keep saying, what the hell happened for 47 years and now he's copying my campaign
trump, As president … and you know it's not going to happen with him, as president, I know my first duty is always to take care of you, the American worker
trump, That's what we're taking care of
trump, Under my administration, we've achieved the most secure border in US history and we are finishing that wall, it's going to be done so fast
trump, It's got to be done so fast
trump, Since 2017 ICE has successfully arrested nearly a half a million illegal aliens with criminal records, including over 145,000 assaults, 40,000 sex offenses and 5,000 murderers
trump, If you don't mind, Democrats will bring them the hell out of our country, we'll get them out of here
trump, Some of them are so violent, we have to keep them
trump, We don't want to house them for 50 years, but if we let them go, they come back in, as much as we watch
trump, If they come back in, we don't want it, we don't want them
trump, So we keep them here, we have no choice
trump, If the left gains power, they will abolish … Republicans will always … they're going to abolish
trump, Republicans will always stand with these incredible heroes of ICE and border patrol
trump, You have to see these ICE people
trump, They go into a den of MS13, and they call them a den, a nest, where you have these guys that are vicious, vicious gang members
trump, And they go in there, they just start swinging
trump, It's the craziest thing, they love it
trump, Now, who wants that job Do you want that job Look, he's a tough guy sitting here, you too, you're tough guys, you don't want any part of it
trump, They're just incredible and they love our country
trump, They love our country
trump, And then people say,  Oh, they're too rough
trump, They're too rough
trump, You have no idea how bad some of these gangs are and what they do
trump, They use knives because it's more painful
trump, They cut people up
trump, They cut two young, beautiful girls, 16 years old
trump, They were going home from school and they cut them to pieces, killed them, they're animals
trump, We invested 2
trump,5 trillion in the US military and launched the first new branch of the US armed forces in 75 years, space force
trump, Not since the air force
trump, Think of it, the air force was last
trump, If I did just that, space force big deal, by the way, it's going to end up being one of the most important things you've ever imagined
trump, But if I just did that, a sixth branch of the US military, that would be a big deal
trump, That's like one of many, many things
trump, We passed VA choice and VA accountability
trump, We killed the founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi, they were after him for a year
trump, We took out the world's number one terrorist and the mass murderer of American troops and many others
trump, Qasem Soleimani is gone
trump, I withdrew from the last administration's disastrous Iran nuclear deal, one of the great disasters
trump, And by the way, it's practically expired
trump, The crazy deal that Obama made practically expired
trump, And his chief negotiator, he never left
trump,  I want this
trump, Nope
trump, We're not giving to you
trump, Okay, let's go on to the next one
trump, Give me this
trump, Nope
trump, Give me this
trump, Nope
trump, Give me this
trump, Nope
trump, He never won a point, he lost everything
trump, It's the worst deal I've ever seen
trump, And the only time he left the table is to go on a bicycle ride and he crashed and broke his leg and his arm
trump, And I promised everybody I would never go riding in a bicycle race
trump, I swear to you
trump, I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem
trump, I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights
trump, That was a 52 year development that I got done in about a day
trump, They'd been negotiating that sovereignty over the Golan Heights, I got it done immediately
trump, 52 years, they worked on that
trump, But instead of endless war, we are forging peace in the Middle East
trump, It's so great
trump, Peace in the Middle East
trump, So Biden's put forward a platform that would end America as we know it
trump, And this is true
trump, I don't think of him as a radical lefty, but basically he's controlled by them
trump, And what about this Kamala How about her She at 15, no, she's at 13
trump, Then people started … no she's at 12
trump, No, she's at 10
trump, She's at nine, she's at seven
trump, These are a poll numbers
trump, She got worse than worse
trump, She quit before she ever got to Iowa
trump, We have a great vice president, Mike Pence
trump, He's great and he says hello
trump, If elected, Biden would destroy social security and destroy protections for preexisting conditions, people with preexisting conditions, drain your Medicare by giving away your healthcare to illegal immigrants
trump, They're all going to come in
trump, If you have that, the problem is we're going to give you healthcare, they're going to all pour into the United States and our country can't afford it
trump, We want to be nice, we all have hearts, country can't afford it
trump, They would get people that never even thought of coming if they see that
trump, Can't do it
trump, They would end our travel bans on jihadist regions
trump, We have very strong … remember I got travel bans
trump, Everyone thought it was such a terrible thing, such a terrible person
trump, He's such a terrible person
trump, I'm such a bad guy, I got travel bans
trump, And increase refugee admissions by more than 700, opening the flood gates to radical Islamic terrorism
trump, Ban school choice and all charter schools, they're very important
trump, In the second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America
trump, A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans
trump, All Americans, race, color, creed, all Americans
trump, So in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we will end our reliance on China, once and for all
trump, We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States, right here in Pennsylvania
trump, We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults or law enforcement and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities
trump, We'd ban them
trump, We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life
trump, Thank you
trump, We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms
trump, We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of endless, ridiculous, stupid foreign wars
trump, We losing our youth to countries that you'd never even heard of, right Never even heard of them
trump, We will maintain America's unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength
trump, We will surprise, think of the surprise medical billing, we're going to end it, surprise
trump, You ever walk into a hospital, oh, gee, fix you up
trump, Oh, great
trump, Then you get a bill for 2,000 for a band-aid
trump, We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, which I've already signed and brilliantly starts on January 1st
trump, Hey, you better vote for me
trump, You know, I think that's, in a way, bigger than healthcare
trump, Can you imagine Biden if he won Price transparency is so big, it's all done, it starts on January 1st
trump, How smart is that How smart
trump, And you're going to see numbers and reductions like you've never seen
trump, Could you imagine if he were president, Sir, our medical costs have dropped in half price
trump, Transparency has been unbelievable
trump, What is that What is price transparency And they'll explain it to him
trump, He still won't have a clue
trump, But can you imagine giving him credit I signed it, it's all done
trump, It starts on January 1st
trump, I say, Why can't you start it now, just in case And know what they said, Sir, statutorily, it has to start then
trump, I said, All right, let's go
trump, But I know we're going to win, so it's not going to matter
trump, And we're going to further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs
trump, We have a favored nations laws, well now we get the same price as all these nations that are paying a tiny fraction, which should have been instituted a long time ago
trump, And the drug companies are going after me with those ads
trump, Oh, it's terrible, terrible
trump, You know why Just every time you see an add from the drug company, they got plenty of money, that's why nobody ever fights them
trump, Anytime you see an ad from a drug company, just remember one thing, your drug prices are coming down
trump, That's what it means
trump, That's what it means
trump, We will strongly protect Medicare and social security and we will always protect patients
trump, We will protect every single patient
trump, America will land, by the way, the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars
trump, You know, NASA was an absolute disaster, grass was growing through the fairways too
trump, They had fairways, that's about all they use, were the fairways
trump, And now we have something, right through the runways, the landing strips, it was all grass infested, it was all weed infested, and now it's the number one space center in the world, by far
trump, It was a closed up mess
trump, And we have rich guys sending up rockets, Elon and others
trump, They send up rockets and we say, let them keep going
trump, Let them keep spending money on these rockets
trump, They love rockets
trump, We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools
trump, We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag
trump, And we will live by the timeless words in our national motto, in God, we trust
trump, For years you had a president who apologized for America
trump, Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the people of Pennsylvania, like nobody has ever stood up before
trump, So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors and your coworkers, and get out and vote And early voting, if you didn't know it, has already begun and watch it and watch those fake ballots, you got to go out and turn them in
trump, If you see somebody cheating, you got to turn them in, from Erie … and you probably will, it's going to be a mess, watch this
trump, But get out and vote early
trump, From Erie to Eastern, from Altoona to Scranton, from Harrisburg to right here in Pittsburgh
trump, Say hello to big Ben
trump, We stand on the shoulders of Pennsylvania patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for their beloved country
trump, This is the state where our founding fathers declared American independence, right This is the state
trump, Such history, such history
trump, It's where the army, weathered it's brutal winter at Valley Forge, I know it well
trump, Where George Washington led his men on a daring mission across the Delaware and where our union was saved by the heroes of Gettysburg
trump, Gettysburg, one of the great, great, incredible sights of history, Gettysburg
trump, So vicious, so horrible and yet so beautiful and so historic, right Incredible
trump, Gettysburg, Pennsylvania
trump, This is the place where generations of tough, strong Pennsylvania workers, mine the coal, work the railroads, forge the steel that made America into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of the world
trump, And we are making it greater, greater, greater than ever before
trump, Not even close, not even close, it's what we're doing, we're doing it together
trump, Proud citizens like you, helped build this country and together we are taking back our country

trump,Hello, Houston
trump, I am so thrilled to be here in the great state of Texas with one of America's greatest, most devoted and most loyal friends, Prime Minister Modi of India
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you
trump, And Prime Minister Modi is doing a truly exceptional job for India and for all of the Indian people
trump, It is my immense privilege to be here with him today at this profoundly historic event
trump, We're especially grateful to be joined by over 50,000 incredible members of our nation's thriving, prospering, flourishing, and hardworking Indian American community
trump, Thank you
trump, Just a few months ago in the largest democratic election in the history of our world, 600 million Indians went to the polls and voted overwhelmingly for Prime Minister Modi and his party
trump, Congratulations, Mr
trump, Prime Minister
trump, That's a lot of people
trump, Earlier this week, I understand you marked another important milestone
trump, I know everyone here joins me in wishing you a very happy birthday
trump, Happy birthday
trump, I want to take a moment to address every resident of Houston effected by the recent horrible flooding
trump, The entire American nation is standing by your side
trump, We're ready
trump, We love you
trump, We support you
trump, We will be there with you every single step of the way
trump, I just left the Coast Guard hanger at Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base where I was briefed on the Texas flooding
trump, We're working with your great governor Greg Abbott, Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, Attorney General Ken Paxton and senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz
trump, Thank you very much
trump, We're working hard together
trump, My administration will not rest until you have fully recovered, restored, and rebuilt and I know you will come back with the same tremendous spirit that we have shown every single time, every time there's been a problem
trump, It's called Houston strong
trump, Prime Minister Modi and I have come to Houston to celebrate everything that unites America and India, our shared dreams and bright futures
trump, I've also come to express my profound gratitude to the nearly 4 million amazing Indian Americans all across our country
trump, You enrich our culture, you uphold our values, you uplift our communities and you are truly proud to be American and we are proud to have you as Americans
trump, We thank you, we love you and I want you to know my administration is fighting for you each and every day
trump, I want to recognize US Ambassador to India Kenneth Juster and Minister Jaishankar of India
trump, Thank you very much
trump, Thank you both
trump, Thank you very much
trump, Thank you
trump, We're also proudly joined by NASA Deputy Administrator Jim Morhard, Deputy Secretary Of Energy Dan Brouillette, Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky, your state attorney general, Ken Paxton, a couple of very great senators
trump, Kevin, thank you
trump, Thank you all for being here
trump, Thank you, Kevin
trump, Thank you
trump, We have a lot of senators
trump, We have a lot of Congress people
trump, There's Mr
trump, Brady, Congressman Brady
trump, He gave us a very, very nice tax cut folks
trump, Thank you, Kevin, very much
trump, Thank you all for being here
trump, Among the leaders here today for this remarkable celebration are many members of the House and Senate
trump, They're all over the audience, including House majority leader, Steny Hoyer, and again, senators Cornyn, Cruz
trump, In my campaign for president, I promised all of that
trump, If we were elected, India would have a true and great friend in the White House and I can tell you, you have never had a better friend as president that President Donald Trump
trump, That I can tell you
trump, The prime minister knows that
trump, On this day, I'm happy to report that the relationship between the United States and India is stronger than ever before
trump, The ties between our two nations are grounded in our common values and our shared commitment to democracy
trump, We are free nations with great faith and a fierce devotion to our national independence
trump, We are governed by the rule of law, guided by commitment to justice, and strengthened by our love of liberty
trump, Our two national constitutions both begin with the same three beautiful words, We the People
trump, That means that in America AMD India alike, we honor, respect, trust, empower and fight for the citizens we proudly serve
trump, Under Prime Minister Modi's leadership, the world is witnessing a strong sovereign and thriving Republic of India
trump, In a single decade, with the help of Prime Minister Modi's pro-growth reforms, India has lifted nearly 300 million people out of poverty and that is an incredible number
trump, Incredible
trump, That's incredible
trump, In the next decade, 140 million Indian households will rise to the middle class
trump, In both India and the United States, we're seeing something really remarkable
trump, Our people are prospering like never before because we are slashing bureaucracy and cutting job killing red tape
trump, In the United States, thanks to our massive tax cuts and all of our great senators and congressmen and women that are here today and pro worker policies, our economy is breaking one record after another
trump, Since my election, we have created over 6 million new jobs
trump, We have created over 750,000 jobs right here in Texas and very importantly, that includes 70,000 new Texas manufacturing jobs
trump, They said that couldn't be done
trump, Unemployment … Think of this
trump, Unemployment in Texas is currently at the lowest rate ever recorded in the history of our country, and unemployment in the United States has just reached the lowest level in over 51 years and very soon we think that will be broken to be a historic number
trump, Unemployment among African Americans, Asian Americans, and Hispanic Americans have all reached their lowest levels in the history of our country
trump, Over the last two years, the unemployment rate among Indian Americans dropped by nearly 33 and one third percent
trump, Wages are rising, incomes are soaring, and inequality is falling at the fastest rate in many, many years
trump, In the past 12 months alone, the average worker has taken home 1,000 extra in rising wages and over 3,000 with tax cuts and all of the other things that we've done
trump, And for the first time in history, most new hires of prime working age are minorities and women
trump, First time that's ever happened
trump, Through our pledge to America's workers, we have secured commitments for nearly 14 million employment and training opportunities for American workers done through our great American companies
trump, We passed the biggest tax cuts and the biggest tax reforms in the history of our country
trump, We slashed a record number of job killing regulations, giving the average American household more than 3,000 every year and never in the history of our country, no matter how long the presidency, have regulations been cut to this extent
trump, Everyday, the Indian American community is helping to strengthen our country and build our future
trump, Indian Americans are pioneering groundbreaking medicines to save countless lives
trump, They're developing revolutionary technology that is changing the world and they're founding new businesses that provide jobs to thousands of our fellow citizens
trump, Prime Minister Modi, I look forward to working with you to make our nations even more prosperous than ever before
trump, And that's what's happening
trump, The economic miracles taking place today are just beginning
trump, Here in the United States, there has never been a better time to hire, invest, grow, and pursue your dreams
trump, Indian companies employ tens of thousands of Americans across a range of industries, including American steel
trump, In 2018 India's JSW Steel announced that it would invest up to 500 million to revitalize a shuttered steel plant in the great state of Ohio
trump, And we welcome India's growing investments right here in the Lone Star State
trump, Nations around the world are investing in the United States because they know we have the best economy and the best workers in the world
trump, They have never invested in our country like they are today
trump, And we want to thank everybody and India has never invested in the United States like it is doing today
trump, And I want to say it's reciprocal because we're doing the same thing in India
trump, On Tuesday, two Japanese companies, Toyota and Aisin, announced a combined investment of almost 800 million, which will create over 900 new jobs right here in Texas
trump, At the same time, we are working to expand American exports to India, one of the world's fastest growing markets
trump, We are committed to ensuring the Indian people have access to the finest goods in the world, product stamped with a beautiful phrase, Made in the USA
trump, And very soon, India will have access to another world class American product, NBA basketball
trump, Wow, sounds good
trump, That sounds good
trump, Next week thousands of people will gather in Mumbai to watch the first ever NBA basketball game in India
trump, Am I invited, Mr
trump, Prime Minister I may come
trump, Be careful
trump, I may come
trump, When it comes to expanding our commercial relationship, no issue is more important than energy security
trump, For the first time ever, the United States is the number one producer of both oil and natural gas on planet earth and number one by far, with much of it coming right here from the great state of Texas
trump, That means more jobs, higher wages, and lower prices at the pump
trump, Yesterday, we were thrilled to hear about the Indian company Petronas pledge to purchase up to 5 million tons of LNG per year from the United States, which could lead to billions of dollars of LNG exports to India in the coming years
trump, And we have plenty of it
trump, Over the last year, crude exports to India have grown by 400 and liquefied natural gas exports continue to soar at record numbers
trump, Thank you
trump, These tremendous exports not only expand employment in America, but they increase freedom and security for India
trump, To keep our nation safe, the United States and India forging an even stronger security partnership
trump, US defense sales to India have also reached 18 billion over the past decade
trump, We make the greatest defense mechanisms and equipment anywhere in the world and India knows that well
trump, We're looking forward to concluding several new defense deals very soon
trump, There are a lot of them in the works
trump, Here in America, we're creating the United States Space Force and we're working closely with India to enhance space cooperation
trump, In November, the United States and India will demonstrate a dramatic progress of our defense relationship, holding the first ever tri-service military exercise between our nations
trump, It's called Tiger Triumph
trump, Good name, it's a good name
trump, Very good name
trump, Today, we honor all of the brave American and Indian military service members who work together to safeguard our freedom
trump, We stand proudly in defense of liberty and we are committed to protecting innocent civilians from the threat of radical Islamic terrorism
trump, Thank you
trump, Both India and the United States also understand that to keep our communities safe, we must protect our borders
trump, Since taking office, my administration has launched a far-reaching effort to improve screening and vetting of applications for entry
trump, We are working hard to ensure that those who would threaten our security are denied admission into our country and we are enhancing our vetting efforts like- … country, and we are enhancing our vetting efforts like never before, not even close
trump, We're doing it on a daily basis, and we'll soon be setting records in every one of the aspects of border security
trump, Border security is vital to the United States
trump, Border security is vital to India
trump, We understand that
trump, We are further taking unprecedented action to finally secure our southern border and stop illegal immigration
trump, I want to thank the president of Mexico, who right now has 27,000 soldiers on our southern border
trump, It's been incredible what's taken place in a short period of time
trump, Illegal immigration is deeply unfair to millions of wonderful legal immigrants who work hard, pay their taxes, follow our rules, and obey our laws
trump, Yet there are those in Washington who would raid your healthcare to … Free benefits
trump, They want to fund free benefits to those who enter our country illegally
trump, We don't want to do that
trump, We don't want to do that
trump, Because if we don't do it, they won't come
trump, I will never allow politicians to take away your healthcare or give it to illegal immigrants
trump, My administration believes our first duty is to the highest loyalty of all
trump, We must always be for the American people, whether it's African-American, Hispanic-American, Indian-American
trump, We are going to take care of our citizens first
trump, We are going to take care of our Indian-American citizens before we take care of illegal immigrants that want to pour into our country
trump, We want to build a nation where every family, immigrant and US-born, can live in a safe community with access to great school, work in a job you love, and have the best chance to reach the American dream
trump, We love the American dream
trump, Just in concluding, I want to say that America has always been a nation of pioneers and patriots, risk-takers and free thinkers, and dedicated workers who have honed a trade, mastered their field, and teach their children to always give their very, very best
trump, Every day Indian-Americans help write the story of American greatness, and everyone here today has a crucial part to play in building an even grander and greater American and Indian future
trump, To help achieve that exciting vision, we are strengthening our cherished bonds with the nation of India, and we are proving the awesome power of democracy and unlimited potential of free people
trump, Together, we will continue to deepen the ties between our nations
trump, We will honor the faith of dignity of our citizens, and we will achieve incredible advancements for our people, for our children, and for the world
trump, We will discover new cures and save millions of lives
trump, We will advance cutting-edge technologies and lift millions and millions of people out of poverty
trump, We will pioneer new frontiers in space, working together, raising the sights of humanity
trump, We will uphold our values, defend our liberty, and control our destiny
trump, The United States and India will make our nations stronger, our people wealthier, our dreamers bigger, and our future brighter than ever before, and it won't even be close
trump, I want to thank everybody for being here
trump, I want to especially thank a great man and a great leader, the leader of India, Prime Minister Modi, my friend
trump, Thank you
trump, God bless you all
trump, God bless India, and God bless America
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you
trump, Now I would like to invite onto this stage in front of this incredible group of unbelievable people Prime Minister Modi, who's going to give us some of his wisdom
trump, His wisdom is indeed great
trump, Thank you all very much
trump, It's been a great honor to be with you
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you
trump,
trump,Well, thank you very much
trump, Vice President Mike Pence, great job you're doing
trump, And hello Toledo We love Toledo
trump, You remember, I was here a lot
trump, You remember 2016, what a year that was, right And 2020 is going to be even better, no doubt
trump, But I'm thrilled to hold the first rally of 2020 right here in the great state of Ohio
trump, And as we begin the new year, our economy is booming, wages are soaring, workers are thriving, and America's future has never, ever looked brighter, ever
trump, We're the envy of every country in the world
trump, We've created seven million brand new jobs since our election
trump, And we will soon be replacing the disaster known as NAFTA with the incredible brand new USMCA, the historic victory for Ohio farmers, workers, and manufacturers, but really a great victory for the United States
trump, It's an incredible agreement
trump, You remember I came and I'd always talk about how bad our trade deals are
trump, We did a brand new one with Korea
trump, So now we have South Korea, we just finished a big one, 40 billion with Japan
trump, On January 15, we're signing a monster, a big beautiful monster, 40 to 50 billion to our farmers
trump, Our farmers will be taking in, I keep saying go buy larger tractors
trump, Go buy larger tractors
trump, I said there's no way, I don't know if you know this story, my people wanted 20 billion to purchase, right 20 billion, 20, that's a lot money, that's a lot of corn, 20 billion, and I said, Make it 50
trump, China's very big
trump, And they said, Okay
trump, They said, Sir, the farmers can't produce that much
trump, I said, Let the farmers tell me that
trump, Tell them to go out and, remember, and buy a bigger what Tractor, buy a bigger tractor
trump, You'll produce it
trump, So 40 to 50 billion of agriculture product and the manufacturers and the car companies, and we brought a lot of car companies into Ohio, you know that
trump, A lot of them are coming in
trump, A lot of them have already been brought in
trump, They're coming in from Japan, they're coming in from all over the world
trump, This is where they want to be
trump, They want to be in the United States
trump, This is where the action is
trump, They're all coming back
trump, I used to go around and talk about how everyone's leaving
trump, They were all leaving
trump, A lot of you were victims of that leaving
trump, These companies would leave, they'd go to Mexico, they'd go to Canada, they'd close up, they'd buy from China
trump, Now they're all coming back, new ones, old ones, they're all coming back, and many are coming right here to Ohio
trump, And just in case you didn't know it, Ohio just had the best year economically in the history of your state
trump, That's not bad, that's not bad
trump, And this year's going to be even better and maybe much better
trump, But weeks ago, I signed the largest ever investment in the United States military,  738 billion, and we created the sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces, the Space Force, and everybody's excited about that
trump, After years and years of devastating defense cuts, we have fully rebuilt the United States military
trump, Some of it's still coming in
trump, We have everything
trump, We've got new planes, we've got new rockets, new missiles, we've got new everything, and it's either here or coming in, 2
trump,5 trillion in new investments
trump, So our military is now stronger and more powerful than ever before
trump, And if you remember, three years ago when I took over, we were depleted
trump, Our military was totally depleted
trump, And by the way, speaking of our military, have we taken care of our vets with Choice, with Choice
trump, That was a big thing
trump, You know, I used to go around and the VA was a terrible situation
trump, People would wait weeks
trump, He's right, he said, Yes, it was
trump, You don't hear too much about that anymore, have you noticed Choice and accountability, you know what accountability is For 44 years, they tried to get accountability
trump, That's somebody bad, works for the VA, you couldn't fire them
trump, You couldn't fire them
trump, They could be sadistic, they could be thieves, they could be whatever they were, you couldn't get rid of them
trump, We got accountability approved, and now we say, You're fired, get out
trump, We get somebody that's good
trump, 44 years, and maybe most importantly of all is Choice, VA, Veterans Choice
trump, So you now wait in line, and a lot of times you'd wait in line for four or five, six weeks you couldn't see a doctor
trump, Now you don't have to wait
trump, You go out to a private doctor, you get yourself taken care of, we pay the bill
trump, What a difference it's made
trump, What a difference it's made
trump, You know, when I was a little bit newer to this game– That's okay, they got it, they got it
trump, They go home to mommy
trump, Go on home to mommy
trump, Go on home to mommy
trump, It's a beautiful sight
trump, Thank you, security
trump, Do we love law enforcement, by the way So with the VA, I used to go around saying, Why don't they do that Why don't these people, why don't they go to a private doctor and work something out And I thought it was a brilliant plan
trump, I said, I'm telling you I am such a smart guy
trump, I said, This is the most brilliant thing ever
trump, And I went back to my people and I said, I have an idea
trump, A veteran's sick, they can't get the kind of service they need, they need a certain kind of doctor, I have an idea, such a great idea
trump, You get to go out, private, you're going to pick out a doctor, you're going to get yourself fixed up
trump, We're going to pay the bill, right And you know what happened And I said, How brilliant is that They said, Sir, we've been working on that for 48 years, but we've never been able to get it approved
trump, So I was very, very disillusioned, but you know what I'm good at Getting things approved
trump, And we got it approved
trump, So we signed that 11 months ago, and what a difference that's made in terms of your lines and in terms of people's health
trump, People would wait online for weeks, and some people weren't very sick and they'd end up being terminally ill
trump, They couldn't get to see the doctor
trump, Now they go out, they get a doctor, we take care of them
trump, We can take care of our vets
trump, So we're using this great power not to pursue conflict, but to really preserve, and I mean in the true sense of the word, preserve peace
trump, We have this tremendous military, and you know what that is That's really a great fighting force, but I hope we never have to use it
trump, I really do
trump, You saw an example of that a couple of days ago
trump, So we seek friends, not enemies, but if you dare to threaten our citizens, you do so at your own grave peril
trump, We've never had a military, what we have now, we've never had anything like it
trump, We were looking at planes that were old and tired, 50, 60-year-old planes
trump, You've heard the story, the grandfather flew them, the son flew them, the current wonderful person flew them, the whole family flew them
trump, Those are all gone now, folks
trump, Those are all gone
trump, In October of last year, US Special Operations Forces executed a daring nighttime raid that killed the bloodthirsty founder and leader of ISIS
trump, The animal known as al- Baghdadi is dead
trump, And the entire ISIS caliphate is destroyed, and his terrorist empire, and he was indeed a monster, has been totally demolished
trump, We killed thousands and thousands of ISIS warriors, fighters, and we have thousands of them right now locked up where they should be
trump, Nobody has ever done what we've done in three years
trump, And I'll say this, when we took it over, it was a mess
trump, We did it in a short period of time, but when we took it over, it was not good
trump, And last week, the United States once again took the bold and decisive action to save American lives and deliver American justice
trump, And you know what I'm talking about
trump, For years, the sadistic mass murderer, Qasam Soleimani, planned and executed attacks against American targets, killing and wounding thousands of US service members and many, many thousands, and even hundreds of thousands, of other people
trump, As the leader of Iran's terrorist Quds Force, Soleimani spread death, destruction, and mayhem across the Middle East and far beyond
trump, He ordered the violent assault on the American embassy in Baghdad
trump, And you saw this was the anti-Benghazi
trump, We got there very quickly
trump, We got there very quickly
trump, This is the exact opposite, we did it exactly the opposite of Benghazi, where they got there so late, all they saw when they got there days later were burning embers from the days before
trump, That's all they saw
trump, We got there very early
trump, We saw what was happening
trump, I saw what was happening, and I said, What's that all about And that was going to be another Benghazi
trump, Had they broken through the final panels of glass, they were breaking and breaking it, had they gotten through, we would have had either hundreds of dead people or hundreds of hostages
trump, That wasn't going to happen
trump, And I called up our great generals, and I said, Get them over there now
trump, And one of our leaders, one of our really admired people, said, Sir, we'll have them there tomorrow
trump, I said, Nope, get in the planes right now, have them there immediately, and they got there immediately, fortunately
trump, But he directed the recent rocket strikes that wounded four American service members, badly wounded, and killed an American citizen
trump, That was just before we happened to hit him
trump, Soleimani was actively planning new attacks and he was looking very seriously at our embassies, and not just the embassy in Baghdad
trump, But we stopped him, we stopped him quickly and we stopped him cold
trump, So at my direction, the United States military eliminated Qasam Soleimani and ended his rampage through not only that part of the world, but much bigger parts of the world, he was all over
trump, He was a bad guy, he was a bloodthirsty terror and he's no longer a terror, he's dead
trump, And yet now I see the radical left Democrats have expressed outrage over the termination of this horrible terrorist
trump, And you know, instead they should be outraged by Soleimani's savage crimes and the fact that his countless victims were denied justice for so long
trump, He was the king of the roadside bomb
trump, You know of the roadside bomb, and then they got bigger, and he'd send them over to Afghanistan and Iraq
trump, And when you see our friends and our great wounded warriors and our great warriors, when you see them without their legs and without arms and with so much damage, it's most likely that he caused that damage, because that's what he liked
trump, He loved planting the roadside bomb
trump, So now he's gone, and that's a good thing
trump, Bernie Sanders, crazy Bernie, has condemned the US military strike on Soleimani, the world's top terrorist, think of it, the world's top terrorist, and we're having people like Nancy Pelosi, that's a real genius, do you believe that one Nancy, nervous Nancy
trump, But here's a guy who slaughtered and butchered civilians all over and military, whoever was in his way, and we have Bernie and Nancy Pelosi, we have them all, they're all trying to say, How dare you take him out that way You should get permission from Congress
trump, You should come in and tell us what you want to do
trump, You should come in and tell us so that we can call up the fake news that's back there and we can leak it
trump, That's a lot of corruption back there, folks
trump, No, but think, seriously, so they want me… So these are split-second decisions
trump, You have to make a decision
trump, So they don't want me to make that decision
trump, They want me to call up, maybe go over there, let me go over to Congress, or come on over to the White House, let's talk about it
trump, When can you make it Well, I won't be able to make it today, sir, so how about say in a couple of days Oh, good, come on over
trump, No, we got a call, we heard where he was, we knew the way he was getting there, and we had to make a decision
trump, We didn't have time to call up Nancy, who is not operating with a full deck
trump, No, they want us to call, can you imagine calling crooked Adam Schiff He's so crooked, he's so crooked
trump, Shifty Schiff and say, Gee, Adam, how are you doing Listen, we have the world's number one terrorist, killed thousands and thousands of people
trump, We'd like to set up a meeting so we can discuss his execution
trump, Would you be willing to meet Well, I won't be able to make it this week
trump, Well, you know, he's traveling fast
trump, We got him lined up, Adam, you little pencil-neck
trump, Nine inches
trump, He buys the smallest shirt collar you can get, and it's loose
trump, Now come on, Adam, we got to meet faster on it
trump, We got to take this guy out
trump, We're not going to have another shot at him maybe ever again
trump, But I can't make it now because I'm trying to impeach Trump, I'm trying to impeach, even though he did nothing wrong
trump, By the way, did you see, I did nothing wrong
trump, They don't even know what in the hell is going on
trump, In fact, it's so weak, she doesn't want to put in the articles, it's so weak
trump, They're so pathetic
trump, They're so pathetic
trump, So they want us to call them
trump, Now, Schiff is a big leaker
trump, He leaks to crazy CNN
trump, See with the little red light on over there
trump, Not too many people are watching CNN
trump, But he leaks
trump, So he'll say, You know, off the record, I got to hurry up because everyone's watching me in the hallway on my cell phone, off the record they've got the number one terrorist in the world, Soleimani, and they're going to get him, they're going to take him out in the next 10 minutes
trump, Please, don't tell anybody I told you
trump, So we have breaking news, President Trump within the next 20, 25 minutes, looks to be taking out terrorist General Soleimani
trump, He's going to do it
trump, It should be happening in about the next 20 minutes, 19, 18, 17
trump, Then we get back to the battlefield, how'd you do, fellas I don't know, sir, he disappeared
trump, I don't know what happened to him
trump, They want us to tell them so that they can leak it to their friends in the corrupt media
trump, You got to say though, that's a lot of media, right That's the way the Academy Awards used to look when it was successful
trump, Then they started hitting us all the time and it became unsuccessful
trump, I love it, I love it, actually
trump, Oh, they have some bad ones here tonight
trump, They have some really bad ones, some really sick ones
trump, They have one good one, by the way, one good one
trump, They have one good one, a bunch of bad ones
trump, Very, very dishonest people and we have some great ones, too
trump, We have some great journalists, great reporters
trump, But you've got a tremendous amount of dishonest media people like I have never seen in my life before
trump, They write things that they know are wrong
trump, They write, if you watched for the last three years, think of it, and then they get Pulitzer Prizes, but it turned out to be all wrong
trump, How do you do that They get Pulitzer Prizes for being wrong
trump, The Pulitzer Prize doesn't mean a thing
trump, It doesn't mean a thing
trump, I mean, I'm here to tell you about the Nobel Peace Prize
trump, I'll tell you about that
trump, I made a deal
trump, I saved a country
trump, And I just heard that the head of that country is now getting the Noble Peace Prize for saving the country
trump, I said, Did I have something to do with it Yeah, but you know, that's the way it is
trump, As long as we know, that's all that matters
trump, I saved a big war
trump, I saved a couple of them
trump, But under my administration, we will never make excuses for America's enemies, we will never hesitate in defending American lives, and we will never stop working to defeat radical Islamic terrorism, never
trump, And nobody's done it like we've done it
trump, And it's we, it's we
trump, It's not me, it's we
trump, It's a whole movement
trump, There has, by the way, never been a movement like this
trump, You know, outside, I don't know what this place holds, it's like 10, 11,000 people, right Outside you have thousands and thousands of people that want to get in
trump, There's never been a movement like this
trump, There's never been a movement like this
trump, And I'll tell you, maybe I'm wrong, but this is bigger than it was in 2016, because in 2016 I said what we're going to do, but now I've completed more promises than I've made
trump, I mean, I've actually completed more, right Like, as an example, many of you were here, look at all those beautiful red hats, keep America great, that's good
trump, But I never talked about, did you ever hear me prior to the election talk about Space Force I never talked about it
trump, We did Space Force, but did we ever speak about it No
trump, There were many things that we've done that we never spoke about, right Right to Try, you know about Right to Try, right They've been trying to get it for 44 years, Right to Try
trump, That's people that are very sick, terminally ill, and they can't get medicine that possibly works
trump, And very well, we have the greatest labs and the greatest doctors in the world, the greatest scientists in the world, we have the greatest medicines in the world
trump, If they have something that they're pretty sure is going to work but is going to take another six years, I brought those times way back, by the way, way down, but they would travel to Asia, they would travel to Europe, they would travel all over the world to try and get a cure because we wouldn't sell them the medicine because we didn't want to take a chance on making the people sick
trump, I said, Wait a minute, they're going to die
trump, They're going to die
trump, Well, sir, we can't take the liability
trump, I said, Then we'll draw up a statement assessing all liability, taking all liability away from the country, away from the insurance companies, away from the healthcare companies, away from the doctors
trump, And with the great help of a lot of incredible Republicans, and we had some Democrats help us, we passed Right to Try, and you have to see how this works
trump, Some people are being, many people are being saved
trump, And you know, the drug companies didn't like it because they didn't want to take people that sick, because they didn't want it on their charts
trump, I said, I understand that
trump, We won't include that
trump, We'll have a separate list over here
trump, They said, Oh, would you do that I said, Yeah, I'll do that, I'll do that
trump, But I didn't talk about Right to Try
trump, I never said I was going to get that done, we got it done
trump, That was a tough one to get done
trump, It sounds simple, but it was tough
trump, There's nothing easy in this country
trump, You know, they said to me, a friend of mine the other day, Who's the toughest country to deal with, President He used to call me Donald
trump, I've known this guy for a long time
trump, I'd like to say 20 years, but it's much more than that
trump, I just don't want to tell you how long, it's too long
trump, And I said, Call me Donald
trump, You've always called me Donald
trump, I can't
trump, He calls me Mr
trump, President
trump, I've known this guy forever
trump, He used to call me, Hey, Donald, let's go out to dinner
trump, You know before, he'd go, Hey, let's go out to dinner
trump, Now he goes, Mr
trump, President, sir, how are you Right How are you But what we've done, and he said, he told me, What you've done, we've never seen anything like it
trump, So many people are saying that
trump, We are all together doing something, not only in terms of the election, not only in terms of what we're doing right now
trump, Don't forget, it's a long way to the election
trump, You know, we have what, 10 months That's a long way
trump, This is my first stop of the year, first major stop of the year
trump, This is it
trump, And we start
trump, By the way, let's do one of those polls right now, do you mind Is there anything more fun than a Trump rally Here we are
trump, Anything more fun than a Trump rally Here we are
trump, We have the greatest phrase of all time, Make America Great Again, and all due respect, I'll never end … I'm a little superstitious
trump, I'll never end it, Make America Great Again, but I see all those hats
trump, I see all those hats, changing it a little bit, but Make America Great Again
trump, I said, you know, today, we just hit the highest stock price in the history of our country
trump, Your 401ks are at records, your stocks are great, but what it really means to me is jobs, more importantly, than anything else
trump, We have the best jobs, the best everything, right We just hit … I can't really say, Make America Great Again
trump, Our military is rebuilt, 2
trump,5 trillion
trump, Our military is rebuilt
trump, We're doing great numbers
trump, Economically, our country is the strongest it's ever been
trump, You have factories moving back into Ohio
trump, You never saw anything like it, right You had your best year
trump, When I say Make America Great Again, what that sort of means is we didn't get there, but we did get there
trump, Now, I have a new theme
trump, It's called Keep America Great
trump, Keep America Great
trump, Now, I'm a very loyal person, and I am concerned about changing the theme because Make America Great Again I think was the greatest political campaign in history
trump, I mean, crooked Hillary spent three or four times more money than I have spent
trump, Crooked Hillary, wait, crooked … We should lock her up, I'll tell you
trump, Crooked Hillary spent three or four times more
trump, I wanted to be a little bit … I have to say, that was a great campaign, and I don't want to change it
trump, I don't want to have this incredible 2016, then go with something, and if something ever happened, this country will go to hell, I just … You know the stocks I'm talking about, the records
trump, You don't have records this way
trump, You have records
trump, Get used to it, because if that happened, you will see things happen that aren't good
trump, But, I have to now say, do I want to change the greatest theme in political history, Make America Great Again, with Keep America Great, right Let's take a little applause, right We'll go Make America Great Again, you'd clap if you want that
trump, Then we would go, Keep America Great, you'd clap if you like that
trump, Okay, are you ready First, Make America Great Again
trump, Ready Keep America Great
trump, You know, that, I call that a free poll
trump, That's better than a poll
trump, Do you ever see these crazy polls that come out We're doing great in the polls, by the way
trump, Remember, I used to come out and talk about the polls We'll start doing that very soon
trump, We're doing great in the polls, but this is like a free poll
trump, Somebody else would go out, they have all this money that they raised, and they give somebody 1 million, and they'll ask 200 people that question
trump, Then, they'll say, Well, Make America Great Again is better, but I will tell you, I haven't heard one thing where that was true
trump, With all of these … I would have said, instinctively, Make America Great Again could not be beaten
trump, I've probably done this 10 times
trump, I have never had it win
trump, It's Keep America Great, and that's what we're doing, but we're going to use both
trump, We're going to use both … Good
trump, Keep America Great
trump, We're going to use both, but Keep America Great
trump, That's probably going to be the dominant theme
trump, For eight years, the Obama administration enabled and emboldened- … the Iranian regime
trump, They gave Iran 150 billion, including 1
trump,7 billion- … in hard, cold cash
trump, Can you imagine No, no, can you imagine 1
trump,7 billion, 1
trump,8 billion in cash The foolish Iran nuclear deal financed Iranian aggression while allowing a quick path to nuclear breakout, that's what it did
trump, By the way, it expires so soon
trump, They can have nuclear weapons
trump, They're not, as I said before, they will not have nuclear weapons
trump, … They hit us with 16 missiles, and I said, How many We were ready to go
trump, We were ready to go
trump, I said, How many How many died How many were wounded Sir, none
trump, None Pretty good warning system, none
trump, How many were hurt How many were … None, sir
trump, So, we didn't do anything
trump, We were ready
trump, We were ready
trump, Not that I wanted to, but we were ready
trump, You have no idea
trump, A lot of people got very lucky
trump, … We have a lot of your Congressmen right now in Congress
trump, They said, Sir, should we come with you I said, No, stay back and vote
trump, They're voting on some pretty important stuff, right But, we were able to get Bill
trump, We thank you, Bill, very much, great job, great warrior
trump, Thank you, Bill
trump, Ohio Lieutenant Governor, Jon Husted
trump, Thank you, Jon
trump, Thank you, Jon
trump, Thank you, Jon
trump, Great job
trump, State Treasurer, Robert Sprague
trump, Thank you, Robert, and you have a lot more money in the bank right now, Robert, as Treasurer, right, than you ever did Ohio Supreme Court Justice, Judy French
trump, Thank you, Judy
trump, Great job
trump, State Senate President, a man highly respected, Larry Obhof
trump, Thank you, Larry
trump, And, a woman who really has become a great friend of mine
trump, She took over this party
trump, We fought like hell
trump, We had some other people that had their mind on taking over the party, but they'd never had a chance against Jane Timken, Jane
trump, And, the man who is in charge of my campaign in Ohio, I had a choice of five people
trump, I said, I like this guy's name
trump, I don't know why
trump, His name is Bob Paduchik
trump, Why do I like his name I said Bob, how are we doing He said, You're going to win big, sir
trump, Because, you know, you keep hearing, you cannot win unless you win the great state of Ohio
trump, That's these guys
trump, Once, I was leading Ohio by a lot in the poll
trump, They never say that anymore
trump, It's terrible
trump, They were saying it when they thought I wasn't going to win, but we were ahead right from the beginning
trump, … I said, Bob, let me ask you, just out of curiosity, I don't have these people
trump, The leaders are not with us
trump, Is that good or bad He said, Sir, it's great
trump, You just went up three points, would you believe this, by not having it He said, Don't worry, sir, you're going to win, and we won by a lot
trump, Now, I understand we're up by a lot more than we ever thought possible
trump, Bob was fantastic
trump, Thank you, Bob
trump, … Then, one of these characters back there, they put me in a contest with the late great Abraham Lincoln, right Who do you like better, Trump or Abraham Lincoln I said Abraham Lincoln- I said, who do you like better They say they did a poll on this
trump, I think I remember the numbers
trump, All I know is, we won against Abraham, Honest Abe
trump, We won, 53 to 47
trump, Can you believe that, Abraham Lincoln I went back to the First Lady, I said, First Lady, I just beat Abraham Lincoln in a poll
trump, I don't know if they had polls back then, but Abraham Lincoln
trump, I always say I can be more Presidential than any candidate that ever ran, than any President, other than maybe Abraham Lincoln when he's wearing his hat
trump, I like Abe Lincoln, but when we're doing well, we have a lot of support
trump, Do you know why Because our country is doing so well
trump, Our country is doing so well
trump, When we went out, we started, and we went right to the top of the polls
trump, It wasn't like these folks today
trump, They are 2, 3, but they're climbing
trump, We went right to the top from day one
trump, We never missed center stage in the debates
trump, Remember those great debates We actually got high ratings
trump, They don't get very good ratings anymore
trump, They're like, it's like death, watching
trump, I should watch
trump, You know, I'm supposed to watch
trump, It's like my job
trump, Try and watch, watch the competition, but it's like watching death
trump, … Did you see where Pocahontas is slipping, badly Bernie, Bernie has gone up
trump, He's surging, Bernie's, crazy Bernie, he's surging, and Biden doesn't know the difference between Iran and Iraq
trump, He's gotten it wrong four times
trump, He goes, When we took our shot at Iraq … No, no, no
trump, They're all saying, No, no, they're screaming, It's Iran, Iran
trump, What His son, right Where's Hunter, where is Hunter No, I went to one of them
trump, I said, We have to have where is Hunter as a witness
trump, They said, What do you mean, where is Hunter I said, That's his first name
trump, I have now made his first name Where's
trump, Where's Hunter Here's a guy, made no money, got thrown out of the military forces, I think the Navy, got thrown out, had no job, had no nothing, so, he went from that to making millions of dollars a year as soon as Sleepy Joe became Vice President
trump, He made millions of dollars a year
trump, Would anybody in this room do that for millions of … I would
trump, He made millions and millions of dollars a year
trump, Ukraine took care of him
trump, How about China He walked out with 1
trump,5 billion to manage, and he never did it before
trump, He didn't know anything about oil and gas
trump, He was making a fortune
trump, So, where is Hunter Where the hell are you, Hunter I'll tell you, I sort of hope it's Joe, because he will hear where's Hunter every single debate, nine times a debate
trump, Where is Hunter … Howdy Doody
trump, The problem is, a lot of people don't remember Alfred E
trump, Neuman
trump, Don't say that
trump, You look much younger than that, I must say
trump, You have Mayor Pete
trump, I mean, give me a break
trump, Can you believe Mayor Pete This is going to be the President of the United States How would he be against negotiating against President Xi of China We just made one hell of a deal
trump, You're going to see the numbers very soon, you know One hell of a deal
trump, They didn't like those tariffs
trump, Thanks to Republican leadership, America is winning again, and America, most importantly, is respected again, respected like never before
trump, You know, for years, NATO has taken advantage of the United States
trump, We protect Europe from Russia, and the numbers have been going down for many, many years, 15 years, 18 years
trump, The numbers is like a roller coaster down
trump, I went over, and I said Folks, you got to pay your bills
trump, You're delinquent
trump, You're delinquent
trump, Then, they don't like me
trump, They say, We like Obama better
trump, They should like Obama better
trump, Obama would go in and say, Thank you very much for coming
trump, We appreciate it
trump, Bye-bye, I'm going back to Washington
trump, I'm going back
trump, I'll be violating the carbon footprint
trump, I'm going to Hawaii to play golf
trump, I drive to play a round of golf at the course I own, it doesn't even cost them anything
trump, He flies to Hawaii, nobody cares
trump, If I drive 20 minutes, it's like, Donald Trump is playing golf today
trump, He violates the carbon footprint, but just think of it
trump, Think of where we've come
trump, Think of where we've come
trump, A great congressman from Tennessee, they have … It's a great state
trump, They have early voting, very early voting, probably the earliest
trump, He said, I don't know
trump, I just left Tennessee
trump, This was in November
trump, This was the election, 2016
trump, He said, I just left this incredible state of mine, and I love that state
trump, Sir, we've seen lines of people that didn't vote before, because they never were inspired to vote, and these are people that never voted
trump, They had hats on, Trump
trump, They have pins, on Trump, Trump, Trump, and Trump
trump, They have the bands on, you know, like a Miss Universe, prom
trump, It says, Trump Pence, and they've got buttons all over it
trump, They've got shirts saying Trump and Trump Pence
trump, I never saw anything like it
trump, If every state is like Tennessee, sir, I hate to tell you, you're going to have one hell of a victory, and that's what happened, right That's happened
trump, You did it
trump, You did it, and I think we're going to have bigger numbers, even bigger numbers, because I'll tell you what, we're a long way from the election
trump, I think the crowds today are bigger than they were the day before the election last time
trump, I really do
trump, You know, Elizabeth Warren- … sadly referred to, she of great Indian heritage
trump, Remember, I used to say, I have more Indian blood in me than she has, and I have none
trump, I turned out to be right
trump, You look at what she's doing, you look at what she's saying, the lies, the deceit, the fraud, you see it all
trump, We are going to do so great
trump, It's got to be something that's going to be special
trump, It's going to be for the record books
trump, The Evangelicals called some of the greatest pastors, ministers, preachers, and they just called today, five of the most respected people
trump, They said things that were incredible
trump, They said, There's never been anything like this in the church that they can … Some of them have been doing it for 30, 40 years
trump, They said, We have never seen enthusiasm like we see for this President and for this Presidency, all of us, like we have right now
trump, … He never said that before
trump, Billy Graham wasn't somebody that would vote and say he voted
trump, Franklin Graham said Billy Graham, maybe the greatest of all, maybe the greatest of all time, he said My father, Billy Graham, who was very old at the time and in trouble, he was in trouble, he was not well, he voted for Donald Trump
trump, What a great tribute that was to me
trump, What a great tribute
trump, Great family
trump, Unemployment has reached the lowest level in over 51 years
trump, African-American, Hispanic-American, and Asian-American unemployment have all reached the lowest rates ever, ever, ever recorded
trump, Wages are rising fast
trump, They're going up very fast, and the biggest percentage increase, makes me happy, are for blue-collar workers
trump, 40 million
trump, Think of this, 40 million American families are now benefiting from the Republican child tax credit, each receiving an average of over 2,200 a year
trump, Now, America lost … This is hard to believe, because you think, How could it possibly be true but this is what happened
trump, Probably, it's the number one reason I'm running
trump, America lost 60,000 factories under the previous administration, 60,000
trump, You wouldn't believe that it's possible, but I know it's true, because I've said it 50 times, and the fakers back there, they've never corrected me
trump, No, it's true
trump, No, it's true
trump, If I were slightly off, if it were, if I was off by two factories, there'd be a headline, Donald Trump Told a Fib
trump, Donald Trump gets to be a Pinocchio again
trump, No
trump, Think of it, 60,000 factories, plants and factories, closed, closed
trump, They went to Mexico
trump, They went to China
trump, 60,000
trump, It's not even … Take a look at a map and put 60,000 little dots
trump, I mean, you wouldn't believe it could be that many, but it is, it's 60,000 closed, gone
trump, They're all coming back
trump, They're all coming back
trump, Right now, just in a very short period of time, we've added 12,000 brand new factories, and many more are coming in
trump, One of the reasons they're coming in is we've eliminated a record number of job- killing regulations, saving the average American household 3,000 a year
trump, Total income gains for median households will reach over, ready 10,000 a family
trump, 10,000
trump, Now, under the Bush administration, the 10,000, that includes what we've done in terms of median income
trump, I'm adding in there the tax cuts, which are tremendous, 2,400
trump, I'm adding the regulation cuts, I'm adding the whole package over 10,000
trump, Now, under President Bush, it was 450
trump, Under Barack Hussein Obama, it was 975
trump, Under President Donald J
trump, Trump, it's 10,000 in three years, three
trump, In three years
trump, Don't forget, President Bush, eight years, 450
trump, President Obama, eight years, 975
trump, President Trump, three years, not even, not even, not even, but three years, 10,000
trump, We're going up
trump, We're going up
trump, … Clean coal
trump, What they do with coal today is incredible, clean coal
trump, With the help of energy workers right here in Ohio, the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world by far, number one
trump, We were number one
trump, … You know, there's a state known as Texas, and I won Texas by a lot, just like I won Ohio by a lot
trump, How would you like to go into Texas and say, By the way, we don't want your oil or natural gas anymore How about that Beto Remember he said, I was born to be President
trump, Anybody that says that, I said, That's the end of his career
trump, Remember, he had the cover of the magazine I won't mention the magazine, sleazebag magazine
trump, He was born to be President, and right after that, he came tumbling down, but he's from Texas, so he was against religion, he was against oil, and he was against guns
trump, Abraham Lincoln could not win in Texas with that platform
trump, That's not a good platform
trump, It's not a good platform, but you have people that want to shut down the oil industry
trump, If you do that, you're going to shut down half your businesses
trump, It's really more than that, and the rest of them are not going to be able to pay because the cost of this energy would be so expensive
trump, We have all forms of energy
trump, We have every form of energy, and we are doing great, but they want to cripple your state's economy
trump, The voters of Ohio will never let that happen, never going to let it happen
trump, Our air and our water right now is cleaner than it's been in 40 years
trump, Sadly, I can't say historic because, you know, a couple of hundred years ago, there was nobody here, right I assume that 2, 300 years ago was cleaner, probably
trump, You never know, but our water and our air is as clean as it's ever been, and I took us out of that horrible Paris accord
trump, I always say, How are you doing with the Paris accord Don't ask
trump, Saved trillions and trillions of dollars that was put in there to hurt us, in my opinion
trump, It was put in there to hurt us
trump, We were paying money to India
trump, We were paying money to China
trump, China's didn't kick in until 2030, we kicked in immediately
trump, We had to pay money
trump, Russia kicked in, in 20 … Let's see, they kicked in before
trump, They were 1990, wait, they were 1996
trump, That was a very dirty period of air, so, they didn't have … We kick in now, and that, it's just unacceptable
trump, We would have spent trillions and trillions of dollars
trump, We would have had to close up, I think, at least 25 to 30 of our businesses
trump, Who the hell would make a deal like that, right Who would make a deal like that No, how unfair
trump, You look at Russia
trump, You look at China
trump, You look at India
trump, They all got these massive breaks
trump, We got no breaks, and we're paying money
trump, I say sometimes to France, How are the yellow vests working out Because they don't like raising their taxes and sending the money to faraway places that they'd never heard of
trump, So, we are in good shape
trump, It took a certain amount of courage to do that
trump, I said I'm going to get killed on this one, and you know what I did it, and I was applauded, because the people get it
trump, The people know what we're doing, and they're tired of being ripped off by the rest of the world
trump, They're tired of being ripped off by the rest of the world
trump, … I immediately canceled the Obama administration's job-killing catastrophe, which would have dealt a death blow to the United States auto industry, the Transpacific Partnership
trump, It was a disaster
trump, That was going to be worse than NAFTA
trump, NAFTA, I always say, the world's worst deal
trump, I think that would have been worse
trump, It would have taken the car industry
trump, It would have taken many of your industries
trump, That was a setup for the United States to get fleeced
trump, … That's going to include, because we take care of our great auto workers of Toledo, the home of Jeep
trump, How good is Jeep I've taken the toughest-ever action against China's chronic trade abuses, including tariffs on 370 billion worth of Chinese made goods, bringing billions and billions of dollars into our treasury
trump, I gave some of that money, because they were targeted, to our farmers, and our farmers did just fine
trump, Now, the deal is done, and the other deals are done, and the farmers are doing very well
trump, We love our farmers, and they never complain
trump, They never complain
trump, You know, when they'd go, the fake news back there, they'd go and they'd talk- And when they come, the fake news back, they go and talk to the farmers
trump, What do you think of President Trump China is deciding not to buy anymore of this
trump, You know what the farmers would say, We're going to have to suffer for a while because there's China and there's other nations have been ripping us off for years
trump, The President is right and we're with the President
trump, How great How great But our strong action paid off and we'll sign that terrific and fully enforceable Phase One trade deal with China
trump, And again, we're keeping the tariffs on because we use that for other money
trump, We are taking billions
trump, Remember what I said We're not paying for it
trump, Because China devalued their currency and then they put a lot of money into the pot
trump, We're not paying for it
trump, And now they're starting to say, I guess he was right
trump, And our trade deficit, as a result, has come, has really come substantially down
trump, It was just in the papers today
trump, The trade deficit has come down
trump, As a result of our actions, steel mills all across Ohio, you know this better than I do, are roaring back to life JSW Steel is investing five hundred million dollars in Acero Junction
trump, Republic Steel is reopening the Loraine Mill that they idled in 2016
trump, Charter Steel is building a 150 million dollar mill in Cuyahoga Heights and Nucor is investing 85 million dollars at a facility in Marion, Ohio
trump, Think of that
trump, I think you do
trump, The steel industry was dead and now it's vibrant
trump, All told, American steel companies are currently making 13 billion dollars worth of new investments all across our nation
trump, Think of that
trump, They weren't investing 25 cents
trump, The industry was dead
trump, Now it's vibrant
trump, After years of rebuilding other nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation
trump, We are finally putting America first But while we are creating jobs and killing terrorists, the Washington Democrats are wasting America's time with demented hoaxes and crazy witch hunts
trump, Think of it
trump, The day they came down that escalator it started
trump, Who the hell else could they take in this stuff Right Can I get some credit for that Most guys would have been in a corner with their thumb in their mouth saying, Mommy, Mommy, take me home
trump, These are bad people
trump, The Democrat politicians we're fighting today are the same ones who took a sledgehammer to Ohio jobs in factories
trump, They destroyed your factories
trump, They destroyed your jobs
trump, But they're losing and we're winning and America's comeback continues full speed ahead
trump, On no issue have Democrat politicians more clearly betrayed the American people than the issue of illegal immigration
trump, Far left radical politicians support deadly sanctuary cities and demonstrated their contempt, scorn, and disdain for everyday Americans and the American family
trump, These jurisdictions release dangerous violent criminal aliens out of their jails and directly onto your streets where they are free to rob, attack, and kill American citizens but stop it
trump, They want open borders
trump, Can you believe it And because of Democrats' open border policies, they want open borders
trump, They want more people flowing
trump, Come on in
trump, Come on in
trump, Innocent Americans are being brutalized and murdered by illegal alien criminals
trump, As just one example right here in Ohio, you all know about it, an illegal alien went on a deadly crime spree, attempting to rape a 14-year-old girl
trump, Then raping an murdering a 60-year old woman
trump, Then shooting at a woman who took a shortcut through the park and was walking with her children
trump, And finally the police came
trump, We love our police
trump, And they were able to apprehend this terrible criminal
trump, Thanks to Democrat policies, MS-13 gang members… they're the worst… were allowed to infiltrate the country
trump, You know I called them animals and Nancy Pelosi said, They're not animals
trump, They're human beings
trump, Take a look at what's happened to her district
trump, Her district is one of the most disgusting dirty… it used to be one of the best in the country
trump, Now it's a disgrace what's happened
trump, Drug dealings all over the place
trump, The homeless they're not taking care of
trump, Tents down major thoroughfares
trump, What happened in San Francisco, in particular her district, and she lives in this beautiful house
trump, But they turn all these arsonists out, including killing their victims with machetes, MS-13
trump, They kill them with machetes
trump, You know why Because it's more painful than using a gun
trump, Federal authorities recently discovered and rounded up more than 25 MS-13 gang members in Central Ohio
trump, And they will be sent to jail or frankly, I they hold them… I don't know that they can hold them
trump, They're going to be sent the hell back home
trump, Last year alone, ICE officers, who by the way are heroes
trump, These are brave people
trump, I don't want to do it
trump, You don't want to do it
trump, Let's see, you can do it
trump, You can do it
trump, You can do it
trump, Most of you wouldn't
trump, I mean, I've seen it
trump, They have these people that are like killers
trump, And now the guys are here
trump, And they want to call them a safe place
trump, And they run in and they're swinging and punching
trump, What the hell kind of a job is that That's what they do
trump, They're tough people
trump, They're great patriots
trump, Who the hell wants to do it They're incredible, ICE
trump, And they get scorned and we take out thousands and thousands of MS-13 members every single year
trump, They throw them in the back of the van and we get them the hell out of our country
trump, But ICE offices worked through Ohio police to remove one thousand two hundred dangerous criminal aliens from your streets
trump, And on all your street, do you see the difference now between what it is now We have a problem over there Go ahead
trump, Take your time
trump, Take your time
trump, Good, thank you
trump, Great job
trump, Thank you
trump, Okay these people here, unlike you up there, these people have been waiting for three days so that they could be here
trump, I don't know
trump, You know what If I had to wait three days, I think I'd like your seat better
trump, I like your seat
trump, But Democrats stand for crime, corruption, and chaos
trump, Republicans stand for law, order, and justice
trump, That's really the way it is
trump, We side with law enforcement, with law abiding Americans, not law breaking criminal aliens
trump, We are removing these illegal criminals and gang members from our country by the thousands
trump, We are sending them home
trump, And we will no let them back in
trump, And I have to tell you, a lot of things are happening
trump, You're going to hear about that in two seconds
trump, Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, illegal crossing are down 75 since May
trump, We have ended catch and release
trump, Catch and release, you know what catch and release is We catch them
trump, We take down their name and we release them
trump, What kind of crap is that These are the policies that we inherited
trump, You catch somebody, take their name
trump, Say Please come back in three years
trump, Right And we're releasing them back to the community
trump, And if you don't do that everybody gets sued
trump, Can you believe this We have ended catch and release
trump, The other one, beauty, how about that lottery It's called VISA lottery
trump, How about this They put their hand… these people are going to America
trump, Bomb
trump, I will not use names because I'll be accused of something later
trump, But from Honduras, what about it El Salvador, we have… He's good
trump, Only in Ohio can that happen
trump, Who's the man that did that Who is that So anyway, but, in Honduras, Guatemala they have like this lottery
trump, Now the people, I've gotten to know the government officials
trump, They're good
trump, They've made some good things
trump, They said, Hey we need to take our people back
trump, They're getting their people back
trump, Before, they wouldn't take them back
trump, They'd send them here to go into our county
trump, We'd bring them back under past administrations and then after that, they'd say, We're not taking them back
trump, We're not taking them back
trump, Take them the hell our of here
trump, We're not letting you land your plane
trump, So we have the government flying the plane all over trying to get a couple prisoners, bad people back
trump, Now they take them back
trump, You know why Because we said, Look, if you don't take them back, we're going to put tariffs on every single thing you sell
trump, Now they say, We'd love to take them back
trump, We'd love to take them back
trump, We'll take them back gladly, sir
trump, No, they couldn't get them back
trump, We'd take off with these absolutely gang members an we'd bring them back and they wouldn't accept them
trump, We couldn't land the plane
trump, We couldn't get anything through the border
trump, It comes through the border this way, not that way
trump, But now they take them back
trump, They've been good actually
trump, They've been very good
trump, Now we paid them a lot of money
trump, We paid them 500 million dollars a year
trump, Can you believe we paid them 500 million through El Salvador And I said, Oh, there's not going to be any money anymore because you're not treating us right
trump, And they've been good
trump, They've been great
trump, They take them back
trump, How many would you like us to take We'll take as many as you want
trump, And here's the big thing
trump, Ready You ready Today in the newspapers in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals we won't the big big beautiful lawsuit when they were all suing us
trump, The wall is being built
trump, We built it
trump, We built already a tremendous amount
trump, But we're releasing four million dollars of military construction funds to build the biggest section of the wall
trump, It's literally being signed now and will be under construction very shortly in couple of weeks
trump, And we've already built over a 100 miles of wall
trump, How about that 100 miles
trump, And by the end of next year, we're going to have a lo more built
trump, And it's already having a big impact
trump, How about that, Democrats Walls don't work
trump, We want technology
trump, I said, What do you want to do They want drones
trump, Oh, good
trump, When people are rushing, the caravans, when they're rushing, having a drone flying around is not going to help you do it
trump, Okay Nothing like… you know five years ago, the Democrats all wanted a wall
trump, They just could never get I built
trump, They didn't know how the hell to build it
trump, I do
trump, So we built 100 miles
trump, I think probably more than that now
trump, We have a lot under contract
trump, But we won our big case just… I woke up
trump, They said, Sir, we have good news
trump, They overturned a horrible decision from the lower court
trump, You can now fund the rest of the wall
trump, I said, Thank you very much
trump, Thank you, Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals have changed some
trump, They want crime
trump, They want gangs
trump, I'm saying all this stuff and then I say, Gee, now I sort of understand why they hate me
trump, Right But it's true
trump, It's true
trump, Their policies are a disaster
trump, They're bad politicians and they're horrible policies but what they do is they stick together and then they're vicious
trump, They're vicious, horrible people
trump, I didn't say that
trump, They're horrible people
trump, What they do to people is as disgrace but they stick together left their party and joined our party
trump, But we've done things nobody's ever done before
trump, But the Democrats are taking their cues from socialist Bernie Sanders and that group
trump, Omar, AOC, Talib
trump, This is a jihadist woman, Talib
trump, Talib
trump, Boy, what a group but they're the leaders of the party
trump, They're really my opinion dealers
trump, That's what happened
trump, That's how they got into this impeachment on this
trump, The leaders of the party are… there's AOC, Talib, and Omar
trump, And Pelosi beats them but she shakes and quivers and she's very soft
trump, But you know who the leader of your party is All of you
trump, You
trump, You're the leader of your party
trump, Everybody believed me
trump, Then she went down
trump, Then she started coming up and then he went down
trump, It doesn't help me to do it a year-and-a-half before the election
trump, That's why, like with the Green New Deal, okay I want to say great things about it
trump, Okay I don't want to knock it and then say, Oh, we're not going to use that
trump, I like it when they say, You no longer can fly airplanes
trump, No longer can you have any cows in meadows
trump, Right No longer can you do anything
trump, We can't do anything anymore
trump, The Green Deal, I love it
trump, I think it's great
trump, It should be debated
trump, It should be debated rally it's a month before
trump, You'll get to hear the real facts
trump, But I'm tired of talking about this 10 months before the election
trump, They can do more with the tape than they can do with a newspaper
trump, No, they'll do it
trump, You'll see it
trump, Somewhere you'll see it, Trump supports his plan
trump, They are sick
trump, Republicans will defend middle class taxpayers and the right to keep the doctor of your choice
trump, We will protect patients with pre-existing conditions
trump, And we will protect your pre-existing physician
trump, You'll have your physician
trump, Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb, right up until the moment of birth
trump, That is why I have asked Congress to prohibit late-term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God
trump, Radical Democrats now have a party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption
trump, The Republican Party is the party of the American worker, the American family, and the party of the American dream
trump, We still have the American dream
trump, Mitch helped a lot
trump, He helped a lot
trump, It wasn't so easy
trump, Mitch McConnell
trump, We're aggressively combating the opioid epidemic and it's bad
trump, In 2018, drug overdose deaths in Ohio fell by… listen to this… 22
trump, That's not good enough but credit to opioid
trump, And as we continue rebuilding our military, we have the star legendary Army tank factory in Lima
trump, And we've authorized 441 new striker fighting combat vehicles and 453 new Abrams tanks to be built in the Buckeye State
trump, That's a lot of tanks
trump, So wait, just a quick story
trump, Okay I'm proud of this
trump, So they had this Army tank plant, right, in Lima
trump, And I said What's going on They're closing it
trump, Oh
trump, They're closing
trump, They're closing everything
trump, When I came they wanted to close everything
trump, So I was president-elect I think right around at that time
trump, And I went to Lima and went through the factory where they make these trucks, the plant
trump, And they make the tanks
trump, They make all of these Army vehicle
trump, And I said, These people are amazing
trump, You could never close this
trump, You could never re-open it again
trump, They'd been doing this for many many decades and this factory was incredible
trump, And I looked at the tanks they made
trump, They're the best in the world by Abrams
trump, They're the best in the world
trump, I said, Wait a minute
trump, If you close this, we're not going to be… where are you going to build tanks This is the primary factory in the whole country
trump, I think it might be the only factory in the whole country
trump, Please send us 200 tanks
trump, We don't want to send you any tanks because we're going to kick your ass
trump, We're going to make our own tanks
trump, Right We've got to make our own tanks
trump, So I did something, based on my instinct because instinct sometimes works better than anything else
trump, Based on my instinct, I said,  You can't close this plant
trump, I went through that plant
trump, I spent two, three hours talking to people who worked there
trump, I looked at some of the hydraulic and I'm, I love all in the world, tractors, all of that stuff
trump, I know a lot about it
trump, And I looked at the carvings
trump, I looked at the metal
trump, I looked at how perfect everything was that turns around
trump, How perfect it fit
trump, They put it on and it would fit like within 1100th of an inch
trump, And I said, You're not going to be able to do this anyplace else
trump, I said, And we're going to be expanding our military
trump, We're going to be rebuilding
trump, Who the hell's going to make our tanks if you close I said, Keep it open
trump, I actually, it was all closed
trump, Is there anybody from Lima Is that a true story Right It was closed
trump, They announced it was closed
trump, It was all set to close
trump, I said, You can't close this plant
trump, And now look, the numbers I just gave you
trump, We're making almost 500 new tanks
trump, You could've never reopened a place like that
trump, It's incredible
trump, And you could've never gotten those workers
trump, They're really skilled people and if you did it would cost you billions and billions of dollars to do it
trump, It wouldn't have been as good as we have
trump, So that was something I did that I'm very proud of because I really over-rode a lot of talented people that wanted it to close
trump, I recognized Israel's true capitol and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem
trump, And we further recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, 52 years
trump, For years you watched as your politicians apologized for America
trump, Now you have a President who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the great people of Ohio
trump, And saying our present battle is the survival of the American nation
trump, If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for, and fought so hard to secure, then we must devote everything we have toward victory in 2020
trump, We have to win
trump, You know, we have to win
trump, Because all of these things that we've done can be undone
trump, And you can have a country that goes to hell very very fast, very very fast
trump, Only in this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp once and for all
trump, And I have seen that dirty rotten swamp better than anybody else in America
trump, A lot of crooked people, disgusting crooked people
trump, With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity
trump, Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration
trump, We will enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase Made in the U
trump,S
trump,A
trump, We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America
trump, Nobody knew that
trump, It could've been done long before I got here
trump, They had the technology
trump, But we're ending the AIDS epidemic in America within 10 years
trump, Isn't that amazing Whoever thought that was possible Who would have thought that's possible We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms
trump, And above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one big beautiful America
trump, We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States
trump, We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement
trump, We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life
trump, We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the true American way
trump, We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag
trump, And we will always live by the words of our national motto, In God We Trust
trump, We stand on the shoulders of generations of Ohio patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation
trump, From Cleveland to Cincinnati, from Dublin to Dayton, and from Columbus to Toledo, this state is the home of proud families and farmers, and miners, and manufacturers, and aviators, and astronauts
trump, Ohio is where the Wright Brothers invented the airplane and where Annie Oakley got her gun
trump, Ohio is the state that gave us American legends and American heroes like Thomas Edison, Neil Armstrong, and the great John Glenn
trump, Ohio is the place where strong American workers mined coal, worked the railroads, and forged the steel that made America into the greatest most powerful nation in the history of the world
trump, And we are making it greater than ever before
trump, Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country
trump, We are returning power to you, the American people
trump, With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working
trump, We are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning
trump, We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God
trump, America is thriving like never before
trump, And ladies and gentlemen of Ohio, the best is yet to come
trump, Because together, we will make American wealthy again
trump, We will make America strong again
trump, We will make America proud again
trump, We will make America safe again
trump, And we will make America great again
trump, Thank you, Toledo

trump, Don't go, don't come, don't do anything
trump, Today it was like, I've never seen anything like it
trump, I've never seen anything like it
trump, You are warriors, thank you
trump, We had some very bad people outside
trump, We had some very bad people outside, they were doing bad things
trump, But I really do, I appreciate it
trump, We have just a tremendous group of people in Oklahoma
trump, And I hear, I hear from your two great Senators and your governor that we're doing very well in Oklahoma, that's the word
trump, That's the word
trump, I stand before you today to declare the silent majority is stronger than ever before
trump, Five months from now, we're going to defeat sleepy Joe Biden
trump, Boy, does he get a pass from these people, huh We're going to stop the radical left
trump, We're going to build a future of safety and opportunity for Americans of every race, color, religion, and creed
trump, Republicans are the party of liberty, equality, and justice for all
trump, We are the party of Abraham Lincoln and we are the party of law and order
trump, Think of what we've done
trump, We will have close to 300 federal judges appointed and approved by the end of my first time, that's an all time record
trump, That's an all time record
trump, I've always heard how important judges are
trump, Now we know how important they are
trump, Think of that over 300, around 300, by the end of the term
trump, And when we have another four years, we're going to have a big, big percentage of the total number
trump, Very important, November 3rd
trump, And two great Supreme Court judges
trump, So we have two justices of the Supreme Court, Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh, they're great
trump, They are, they're great
trump, We have two
trump, And we could get a few more, yeah, we can get a few more
trump, We've spent over 2 trillion to completely rebuild the unmatched strength and power of the United States Military
trump, And all of that incredible equipment, whether it's submarines or missiles or rockets or jet fighters, bombers, it's all built in the USA
trump, We passed V
trump,A
trump, Choice
trump, Thank you very much, Jim
trump, Where's my Senator Jim Inhofe, you better vote for him, he's running, he's great
trump, But we'll get to him and James Lankford in a second, two great Senators
trump, You have two great senators
trump, So we passed V
trump,A
trump, Choice
trump, So if you're a veteran, for years and years, they've wanted to do it for almost 50 years, we got it done
trump, We get a lot of things done
trump, And so if you're a veteran and you have to wait on line for one week, two weeks, three weeks, five weeks, seven weeks, two months
trump, What happens is you go outside, you get a private doctor, you get fixed up and they pay your bill
trump, We take care of the bill
trump, We take care of the bill and you get immediate service
trump, It's never happened before
trump, And our approval rating at the V
trump,A
trump, is now 91, that's how good it is
trump, Never been anywhere near that number
trump, Never been anywhere near that number
trump, And V
trump,A
trump, accountability, we had a lot of bad people in the V
trump,A
trump, People that didn't love our vets, people that were sadistic, people that stole, a lot of bad people
trump, You couldn't get rid of them because they were, let's say it could be unions, it could be civil service, right, let's say, let's just say
trump, And so you couldn't get it done
trump, That was another one for decades and decades, they wanted to get it changed
trump, And I got it done with those people and your Congressman, your Congressman who I'm going to introduce
trump, V
trump,A
trump, accountability, and now somebody treats our veterans badly and we look at them and what do we say We say, you're fired, get out, right Get out
trump, They got rid of a lot of bad people that were there for a long time
trump, Sort of like me in Washington, draining the swamp
trump, I never knew it was so deep
trump, But it's happening
trump, It's happening, I never knew it was so deep
trump, It's deep and thick and a lot of bad characters
trump, Thank you
trump, We're lowering the price of prescription drugs, making our allies pay their fair share
trump, They get a big bargain on drug prices and enacting fair trade deals
trump, That finally, finally, after all these years put America first
trump, I've been saying it for a long time
trump, We passed the largest tax cuts in the history of our country
trump, The Democrats want to raise your taxes
trump, Tell me about that
trump, Tell me about that
trump, I guess I'm old fashioned
trump, All my life, all my life, I heard politicians want to lower taxes, not raise them
trump, If you could lower him, you couldn't lose
trump, The Democrats want to substantially raise your taxes
trump, How do you figure that How do you figure that And regulation cuts, we passed more regulation cuts than any administration in the history of our country
trump, And with the help of our great energy workers, many of them come from the great state of Oklahoma
trump, Do you ever notice that Biden, no, do you ever notice that Biden oftentimes gets the state wrong He's in Iowa and he says it's good to be in Idaho
trump, No, no, you're in Iowa
trump, He's in New Hampshire and he says it's great to be in Ohio
trump, No, no, no, you're in New Hampshire
trump, That happens to him all the time, hasn't happened to me yet
trump, When that happens, there's nothing you can do to make up for it
trump, You might as well just walk off the stage because the speech is a disaster
trump, Right, right
trump, But we just turned the United States into the dominant energy super power of the world, of the world
trump, And because of the Chinese virus, what happened about three months ago, it looked like we were in big trouble and we were, and I got it back together
trump, I called Russia
trump, Right, I called Russia
trump, I called Saudi Arabia and believe it or not, I called Mexico
trump, Mexico was a little bit tough
trump, That's called OPEC Plus, did you ever hear of OPEC Plus
trump, That's OPEC Plus plus
trump, And we got them to do the right thing and we have our energy back to almost 40 a barrel, meaning you have an energy business again
trump, Almost 40 a barrel
trump, Couple of months ago, it was zero and we were going to lose 10 million energy jobs, 10 million jobs
trump, So Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota, and many other states would have been hurt
trump, Now you think you're going to be hurt there
trump, You try putting AOC in judge of your energy
trump, That will make the pandemic look like child's play to the people in energy
trump, She has one problem, it's called petroleum
trump, No president or administration has done more in the first three and a half years than the Trump administration
trump, Not even close
trump, Nobody
trump, How about the CNN anchor, how about the CNN anchor, you know, did a little shave job in the head, which is fine
trump, And he's standing in front of a building saying, things are very peaceful here
trump, And the building is, it looks like the biggest fire I've ever seen
trump, The whole town is burning
trump, It's like the biggest fire
trump, And he said, Things are very good here, Anderson
trump, I think it's great
trump, These are wonderful people, Anderson
trump, Did you ever see that It looked like the world was coming to an end
trump, And we did something in Minneapolis after watching for three or four days, I called, I said, You got to get … you can't protect yourselves
trump, I got them to take 8,000 National Guardsmen
trump, And in one hour it all ended and they rode through the next three weeks with no problem
trump, And we did the same thing in other cities
trump, But how about Seattle Isn't that great So they take over a big chunk of a city called Seattle
trump, I mean, we're not talking about some little place, we're talking about Seattle
trump, Have you ever been to Seattle They took over a big chunk and the governor, who's radical left, all of these places I talk about are Democrat, you know that, every one of them, every one of them
trump, And I'd have an offer out, I said, Anytime you want we'll come in, we'll straighten it out in one hour or less
trump, Now I may be wrong, but it's probably better for us to just watch that disaster
trump, I flew in with some of our great congressmen, who we're going to introduce it a second
trump, And I said to them, Congressmen, what do you think I can straighten it out fast, should we just go in No, sir
trump, Let it simmer for a little while
trump, Let people see what radical left Democrats will do to our country
trump, But Americans have watched left wing radicals, burn down buildings, loot businesses, destroy private property, injure hundreds of dedicated police offices
trump, These police officers, they get injured, they don't complain
trump, They're incredible
trump, And injure thousands upon thousands of people only to hear the radical fake news say what a beautiful rally it was
trump, And they never talk about COVID
trump, They don't talk about, when you see 25,000 people walking down Fifth Avenue or walking down a street of a Democrat run city, you never hear them saying, they're not wearing their mask
trump, You don't hear their say, as they're breaking windows and running in
trump, And then when I say the looters, the anarchists, the agitators, they say, What a terrible thing for our president to say, what a terrible thing
trump, But you don't hear them talking about COVID, COVID, to be specific, COVID-19
trump, That name gets further and further away from China, as opposed to calling it the Chinese virus
trump, And despite the fact that we … I have done a phenomenal job with it, I shut down the United States to very heavily infected but all people from China in late January, which is months earlier than other people would have done it, if they would have done it at all
trump, I saved hundreds of thousands of lives
trump, We don't ever get even a mention
trump, Then I closed it down to Europe early, closed it down because I saw what was happening
trump, And by the way, most people said, don't do it, don't do it
trump, We saved hundreds of thousands of lives and all we do is get hit on like we're terrible
trump, And what we've done with the ventilators and with the medical equipment
trump, And with testing, you know, testing is a double edged sword
trump, We've tested now 25 million people
trump, It's probably 20 million people more than anybody else
trump, Germany's done a lot
trump, South Korea has done a lot
trump, They called me, they said, the job you're doing … Here's the bad part
trump, When you do testing to that extent, you're going to find more people, you're going to find more cases
trump, So I said to my people slow the testing down, please
trump, They test and they test
trump, We had tests and people don't know what's going on
trump, We got tests, we got another one over here
trump, The young man's 10-years-old
trump, He's got the sniffles
trump, He'll recover in about 15 minutes
trump, That's a case, add him to it
trump, That's okay
trump, That's a case
trump, I was actually with a very nice man, very good man, even though he's very liberal, the Governor of New Jersey, right We know him Now listen, he said to me, something that's amazing
trump, New Jersey was very heavily hit, very hard hit, thousands of people
trump, He said with thousands of people that died, thousands of people, there was only one person that died under the age of 18
trump, Would you believe that Which tells me one thing, that kids are much stronger than us
trump, When you see a little kid running around say, Boy, oh, boy, do you have a great immune system How about a piece of your immune system They don't even know about this
trump, Let's open the schools, please
trump, Open the schools
trump, Open the schools
trump, We got to get them open
trump, In the fall, we got to get them open
trump, The unhinged left wing mob is trying to vandalize our history, desecrate our monuments, our beautiful monuments
trump, Tear down our statues and punish, cancel and persecute anyone who does not conform to their demands for absolute and total control
trump, We're not conforming, that's why we're here, actually
trump, This cruel campaign of censorship and exclusion violates everything we hold dear as Americans
trump, They want to demolish our heritage so they can impose their new oppressive regime in its place
trump, They want to defund and dissolve our police departments, think of that
trump, 00 o'clock in the morning and a very tough, I've used the word on occasion, hombre, a very tough hombre is breaking into the window of a young woman whose husband is away as a traveling salesman or whatever he may do
trump, And you call 911 and they say, I'm sorry, this number's no longer working
trump, By the way, you have many cases like that, many, many, many
trump, Whether it's a young woman, an old woman, a young man or an old man and you're sleeping
trump, So what are you going to do, right So they want to defund
trump, They really do, this as a serious movement
trump, And in Minneapolis, the council's already passed it
trump, In Seattle, you see what's going on there, it's even worse, okay
trump, These people are stone cold crazy
trump, They're crazy, you want to say that beautiful heritage of ours, we have a great heritage
trump, We're a great country
trump, You are so lucky I'm president, that's all I can tell you
trump, People have come up to me, say, How do you take it I say, Do I have a choice Do I have a choice We deal with a lot of bad people, but we're winning
trump, And every once in a while, I'll have one of these days where I'm hit left and right, left and right, like even this great event
trump, If you could have seen outside or if you could have heard the reports, the reports, Oh, it's COVID
trump, It's this again
trump, By the way, it's a disease without question, has more names than any disease in history
trump, I can name, Kung flu
trump, I can name, 19 different versions of names
trump, Many call it a virus, which it is
trump, Many call it a flu, what difference I think we have 19 or 20 versions of the name
trump, But they say to me, Where do you get the energy I say, I don't have a choice
trump, I don't have a choice
trump, It was interesting, to show you how fake they are, you might've seen it
trump, So last week they called me and they say, Sir, West Point, West Point, we're ready
trump, I said, Oh, that's right
trump, I have to make the commencement speech at West Point
trump, Just to show you how bad the fake news is, so they say to me, Sir, we're ready to go
trump, I say, Let's go
trump, This is after saying hello to a lot of cadets, inspecting little areas of a building, that was very exciting
trump, Actually, it's beautiful, very old
trump, Studied a lot of our great generals, some of our presidents that went there
trump, West Point is beautiful, right on the Hudson River
trump, But after an hour, the general that runs it is a fantastic guy
trump, After an hour, we land, we do some more inspections and they say, Sir, are you ready Yes, I am
trump, So we walked like the equivalent of about three blocks, which is fine
trump, We go onstage, which is fine
trump, They make speeches, then I make a speech that lasted a long time
trump, I don't know, maybe 45 minutes, maybe longer, I don't know but a long time
trump, The sun is pouring down on me, okay
trump, But they said to me before the speech, Sir, would you like to salute each cadet, each single cadet Or maybe there'll be in groups of two
trump, Would you like to salute Like this Yes
trump, Like this, almost 600 times
trump, You know what that is 600 times
trump, Thank God they were in twos because let me tell you, you do that 600 times, you go home and you say it's like a workout without a weight, right 600 times
trump, So I did that
trump, Then the incredible helicopters, brand new gorgeous helicopters, the Apaches and the other new ones that we just bought like that, but I make this speech
trump, I salute for probably an hour and a half, maybe more, but around that
trump, Watch
trump, If I'm off by two minutes they'll say, He exaggerated
trump, It was only an hour and 25 minutes
trump, He exaggerated, he lied, he lied, he's a liar
trump, These people are sick, the fake news
trump, So then I finish saluting my final salute, I said, Thank goodness
trump, Thank you very much
trump, Think of it
trump, So essentially almost 600 times
trump, Now the general says, Sir, are you ready I said, I'm ready General, where are we going now You have to understand I left early in the morning to get there
trump, Now it's sort of late in the afternoon
trump, A lot of these fakers were with us
trump, So they know
trump, He said,  Sir, we can now leave the stage
trump, I said, Great general, let's go, I'll follow you, and he goes like this, Right here, sir, and I walked off
trump, The stage was higher than this one and the ramp was probably 10 yards long
trump, I say, General
trump, Now you got to understand, I have the whole corps of cadets looking at me and I want them to love their president, I did this big thing
trump, I love them, I love them
trump, They're incredible, and they do
trump, I said, General, I've got myself a problem, general
trump, Because I'm wearing leather bottom shoes which is good if you're walking on flat surfaces
trump, It's not good for ramps and if I fall down, look at all those press back there, look at them
trump, This was a steel ramp, you all saw it because everybody saw it
trump, This was a steel ramp
trump, It had no handrail, it was like an ice skating rink, and I said, General, I have a problem, and he didn't understand that at first
trump, I said, There's no way
trump, He understood, I just saluted almost 600 times
trump, I just made a big speech
trump, I sat for other speeches
trump, I'm being baked
trump, I'm being baked like a cake
trump, I said, General, there's no way I can make it down that ramp without falling on my ass, General
trump, I have no railing
trump, It's true
trump, So I said, Is there like something else around Sir, the ramp is ready to go
trump, Grab me sir, grab me
trump, I didn't really want to grab him
trump, You know why Because I said, That will be a story too
trump, So now I have a choice
trump, I can stay up there for another couple of hours and wait till I'm rescued or I can go down this really steep, really, really, really … It's an ice skating rink, it's brutal
trump, So I said, General, get ready because I may grab you so fast
trump, Because I can't fall with the fake news watching
trump, If I fall, if I fall, I remember when President Ford fell out of the plane, do you remember I remember when another president, nice man, threw up in Japan, and they did slow motion replays
trump, It's true, right I don't want that, general
trump, Now he's standing there, big strong guy, and he's got these shoes but they're loaded with rubber on the bottom because I looked, the first thing I did, I looked at his shoes
trump, Then I looked at mine
trump, Very, very slippery
trump, So I end up saying, Okay, general, let's go
trump, I will only grab you if I need you
trump, That's not a good story
trump, Falling would be a disaster
trump, It turned out to be worse than anything, I would have been better off if I fell and slid down the damn ramp
trump, Right So what happens is I start the journey, inch by inch, right I was really bent over too
trump, I didn't like that
trump, I didn't like this picture
trump, This picture I'm sure will be an ad by the fakers
trump, So I was bent over, right Bent over like this
trump, Then we finally reached almost the end and the fake news, the most dishonest human beings, they cut it off
trump, You know why Because when I was 10 feet short, I said, General, I'm sorry, and I ran down the rest, right I looked very handsome
trump, That was the only good
trump, I wouldn't want to run down the whole thing because the fall there would be definitely bad
trump, So I took these little steps, I ran down the last 10, and by the way their tape, take a look
trump, In almost every instance, it ends just before I run, and they said, Here was the number one trending story
trump, I call my wife, I said, How good was that speech I thought it was a … Hey look, I will tell you when I make good ones and bad ones
trump, Like so far tonight, I'm average, but we're having fun, we're having fun
trump, So far tonight, but I call my wife and I said, How good was it, darling She said, You're trending number one
trump, I said to our great first lady, I said, Let me ask you a question
trump, Was it that good of a speech that I'm trending number one Because I felt it was really good
trump, No no, they don't even mention the speech
trump, They mention the fact that you may have Parkinson's disease
trump, It's true
trump, It's true
trump, It's true
trump, They say there is something wrong with our president
trump, I'll let you know if there's something wrong, okay I'll let you know if there's something, I'll tell you what, there's something wrong with Biden, that I could tell you
trump, So then my wife said, Well it wasn't only the ramp
trump, Did you have water I said, Yeah
trump, I was speaking for a long time
trump, I didn't want to drink it, but I wanted to wet my lips a little bit
trump, You're drinking, you're working hard up there with the sun pouring down on you
trump, I love this location, the sun's like this
trump, This way they save on lighting, right That's why they did it probably
trump, So what happens is I said, What does it have to do with water They said, You couldn't lift your hand up to your mouth with water
trump, I said, I just saluted 600 times like this, and this was before I saluted, so what's the problem She said, Well I know what you did
trump, You had on a very good red tie that's sort of expensive
trump, It's silk because they look better
trump, They have a better sheen to them
trump, And I don't want to get water on the tie, and I don't want to drink much, so I lift it up, the water
trump, It's so unfair
trump, It really is
trump, So unfair
trump, They are among the most dishonest people anywhere on earth
trump, They're bad people
trump, Bad people
trump, Okay, that's enough of that
trump, I wanted to tell that story
trump, Does everybody understand that story The left-wing anarchists tore down a statue of Thomas Jefferson
trump, Now we're getting into the real stuff
trump, They decapitated a statue of Christopher Columbus, except in New York when the Italians surrounded it
trump, They didn't have too much of a chance
trump, Those Italians, I love the Italians
trump, They heard they were going to rip down their beautiful Christopher Columbus and all of a sudden they circle that thing
trump, They didn't do too well in hurting Christopher, did they Thank you to our Italian population, we're very proud of you, right Two days ago, leftist radicals in Portland, Oregon ripped down a statue of George Washington and wrapped it in an American flag and set the American flag on fire
trump, Democrat, all Democrat
trump, Everything I tell you is Democrat and you know we ought to do something, Mr
trump, Senators, we have two great senators, we ought to come up with legislation that if you burn the American flag, you go to jail for one year
trump, One year
trump, Jim and James
trump, Jim and James
trump, We ought to do it
trump, You know they talk about freedom of speech and I'm a big believer in freedom of speech, but that's desecration, that's a terrible thing they do
trump, We used to have things, we don't have them anymore because we want to be so open, so everything, and look what happens We should have legislation that if somebody wants to burn the American flag and stomp on it or just burn it, they go to jail for one year, okay In Seattle the Democrat mayor and the Democrat city council have surrendered control of six city blocks to an anarchist … Now these are anarchists, these are not protestors
trump, You listen to the fake news, they say, Oh, the protesters were lovely
trump, Could you imagine if people just even slightly to the right tried to take over Seattle They'd have machine guns out to get them, but these people can take over the city, look at what they've done to businesspeople that have spent years and years building their business, and now they're wiped out
trump, Take it away
trump, Governor Inslee ought to get his act together, get in there, I'll help you, I'll do whatever you want
trump, I'm waiting for a call, I would love to do it
trump, I would love to do it, it'll take less than an hour and it'll all be over with and you'll have your city back
trump, Yet Biden remains silent in his basement in the face of this brutal assault on our nation and the values of our nation
trump, Joe Biden has surrendered to his party and to the left-wing mob
trump, He has no control
trump, Does anybody honestly think he controls these radial maniacs You know what he says to his wife when he's not confusing her with his sister Get me the hell out of there
trump, These people are crazy
trump, That's what he says
trump, He has absolutely no control
trump, You know a lot of times I'll make like a speech and I'll have this beautiful paragraph come out criticizing every little aspect of the speech, beautiful, brilliant, but Joe didn't … It'll say, A comment from Joe Biden, but he didn't say it
trump, Professional people, great students in English lit, people that are very smart say it
trump, Joe Biden said, and they'll go into this highly complex paragraph, beautifully worded and I say, Joe didn't say that
trump, Joe doesn't even understand it
trump, wait a minute, Air Force One is 31 years old
trump, People don't realize that
trump, So I said, they gave me a charge, very early in my administration like how about the first week Sir, would you sign for this plane Now it's actually two planes
trump, Would you sign for this plane Air Force One I said, How old is the original or the one we have now Sir, it's 31, 32 years
trump, I'd see people coming in from foreign lands that can't compete with us, rich countries but they can't compete with the … They have a brand new beautiful 747-800, and I say, Wait a minute
trump, That country has new and we have a 31-year, so somebody had to do …
trump, This was the Boeing before that and they were riding high, like I was before this thing came in, but we're still riding high because you know what On November 3 we're going to win
trump, We're going to win
trump, So they came in and they came in and they said, No no no, we want 5
trump,6 billion, whatever it was
trump, Whatever it was, if I'm a little bit off they'll go crazy
trump, Whatever, but it was a lot
trump, 5
trump,6 billion
trump, Nope, got to have a three
trump, Got to have a three, call me up
trump, Nope, cancel the contract
trump, I said, Cancel the contract
trump, I want it canceled
trump, I said, General, can you cancel the contract He said, Yes sir, I'm very proud of it
trump, Oh good
trump, Cancel it
trump, Okay sir
trump, By the way, to cancel it, do you have to pay anything Yes sir
trump, We have a cancellation fee sir
trump, How much is it, general 250 million
trump, I said, What Sir, we made a good deal
trump, 250 million to kill
trump, You mean if we don't buy the plane we have to hand them 250 million
trump, That's not good, right Look at these two guys, they're looking
trump, By the way, that's like a good story compared to some I could tell you, like with aircraft carriers
trump, So they said, 250 million Or I always say this, or around that number, because if I'm off by a little bit, they say, Oh, he exaggerates
trump, I look at numbers all day long
trump, That's what I look at for years now, for my whole life when you think of it
trump, 250 million cancellation fee, sir
trump, He was very proud of himself
trump, What a great … I say, General
trump, Don't cancel
trump, Don't cancel
trump, Just tell them I don't want the planes
trump, Don't put anything in writing, don't put it in writing, general
trump, Why sir Because I don't want to pay 250
trump, True
trump, You hear that Jim Jim Inhofe, he's great
trump, You hear that Jim You know that story
trump, He does a great job
trump, So here's what happened, the bottom line
trump, Boeing says, No way, no way, no way
trump, The next week they say, No way we're doing it
trump, The next week they said, How about 5 billion I said, No way
trump, No way
trump, The next week they said, 4
trump,8
trump, I said, Nope
trump, It's got to have a 3 at the front of it
trump, Don't you understand, you dumb son of a bitch Don't you understand I turned out to be right
trump, Turned out to be right
trump, Nobody gets that
trump, Nope
trump, Got to have a three
trump, Next day, they come back, 4
trump,5 is our best offer
trump, Nope
trump, I'm not doing it
trump, I'm not doing it
trump, Come back when you're ready
trump, A month goes by, another month, they never heard about it, they never heard from me, they thought I was serious, I was, and they came back at 4 billion
trump, That's a lot of money but I save like a billion six or a billion seven
trump, Nobody wants to talk about it
trump, Nobody wants to talk about it
trump, When I get foreign nations to pay us billions and billions of dollars, nobody wants to talk about that
trump, When I take soldiers out of countries because they're not treating us properly, Germany is an example
trump, I mean I have a German heritage like some of you
trump, I said, Let's get it down from 50,000
trump,00 to 25,000
trump,00 because they're delinquent
trump, For many years they're delinquent
trump, They haven't been paying what they're supposed to be paying
trump, They're paying 1 instead of 2 and 2 is a very low number, and they say, Yes, we think by And they say, yes, we think by 2030, maybe 2032, we could get current
trump, I said, No, Angela, please
trump, Don't say that Angela
trump, It's true
trump, You know who I'm talking about
trump, By the way, very nice woman
trump, Very good negotiator
trump, I said, Angela, that's a long time, this was in 2019
trump, She said 2032
trump, I said, No Angela, that's not working
trump, But I said, because now they want to get cared, but I said, Well, what about the last 25 years All the money you owe us Everybody forgot about that
trump, They forget about all the money that wasn't paid
trump, I said, What about the trillion dollars that you really owe So we're negotiating let's see, but in the meantime, we're reducing our troops
trump, Remember this, we're supposed to protect Germany from Russia, but Germany is paying Russia, billions of dollars for energy coming from a brand new pipeline
trump, So they pay the country we're supposed to protect them from, they pay billions of dollars to that country
trump, We're supposed to protect them
trump, Excuse me, how does that work And the great thing is with Jim Inhofe and with James Lankford, likewise, they just said they love you James
trump, When they hear it, they get it
trump, A lot of people don't get it
trump, They get it
trump, We cannot continue to be ripped off
trump, We're ripped off by so many countries and we're stopping it
trump, And that means that a lot of people don't want me here
trump, They don't want me
trump, There are a lot of people that don't want me
trump, They don't sell a lot of bombs when we're not dropping bombs on people
trump, You know that, right It's called the military industrial complex
trump, When rioting and looting broke out in our nation's Capitol, I very quickly deployed the National Guard
trump, I said, Get them in
trump, After watching for an evening or two, we stopped the violence and restored peace and order to the streets
trump, And last night that had a little breakout
trump, Again, they ripped down a statue that was 110 years old, beautiful piece of art in front of the police precinct with our radical left mayor watching on television
trump, We're not happy
trump, That's going to be very expensive for DC
trump, They're always looking for money
trump, We need more money
trump, We always need more money
trump, And then they don't do the proper job
trump, So it's not going to be good for Mayor Bowser, Mayor Bowser there
trump, They were heading over to the Jefferson Memorial recently and they wanted to do damage to our great, beautiful Jefferson Memorial
trump, Not going to happen
trump, Don't worry about it
trump, We have it surrounded with very strong people
trump, The choice in 220 is very simple
trump, Do you want to bow before the left wing mob Or do you want to stand up tall and proud as Americans
trump, And explain this to the NFL
trump, I like the NFL
trump, I like Roger Goodell, but I didn't like what he said a week ago
trump, I said, Where did that come from in the middle of the summer Nobody's even asking We will never kneel to our national anthem or our great American flag
trump, We will stand proud and we will stand tall
trump, I thought we won that battle with the NFL
trump, The stadiums were emptying out
trump, Did you see those stadiums It took them a long time to get you back
trump, A lot of people didn't like that
trump, A lot of people that you wouldn't even think would care that much
trump, I've had people that I said, These are super left liberals and they didn't like it
trump, Joe Biden and the Democrats want to prosecute Americans for going to church, but not for burning a church
trump, They believe you can riot, vandalize and destroy, but you cannot attend a peaceful pro-America rally
trump, They want to punish your thought, but not their violent crimes
trump, They want to abolish bail, abolish and open up your borders
trump, They want open borders, let everyone, and by the way, we're doing so well
trump, We have a record this month on the borders
trump, Nobody's coming in
trump, Very few people
trump, And they want to abolish ICE, our great people from ICE who send the roughest toughest, meanest people that you've ever seen or ever heard
trump, Generally speaking, when they have lots of tattoos on their face, they're not looking to do you much help
trump, ICE, they're rough guys
trump, they're great Americans, but they'll walk into, they caught them in a pack
trump, They'll walk into a pack of tough MS-13 gang members
trump, And we shouldn't say this, it's not nice
trump, They want us to negotiate
trump, They start swinging
trump, And the other such way, everybody's swinging, at the end, they carry them back and they throw them into the paddy wagon
trump, They're great
trump, And these people want to get rid of ICE
trump, They get rid of murderers
trump, They get rid of rapists
trump, They get rid of the worst scum on earth
trump, And when I called them animals, I said, They're animals
trump, And Nancy Pelosi, they cut up a young woman
trump, They cut up a young woman and her friend, cut them up with a knife because it was more painful
trump, Dead
trump, Cut them up with a knife because it's more painful
trump, It takes longer than shooting a gun
trump, They cut them up
trump, I said, These are animals
trump, And Nancy Pelosi said, These are human beings
trump, They're not animals
trump, If I lose an election over that, you know what This country is in big trouble
trump, They want to disarm law, abiding citizens and dismantle our police forces while freeing vicious MS-13 gang members
trump, In Joe Biden's America, rioters, looters, and criminal aliens have more rights than law abiding citizens
trump, And that's true
trump, In my administration, we defend American citizens and we deport MS-13 members or put them in jail if we have to
trump, The chaos you're seeing in our democratic run cities, these are all run by the Democrats, is what will happen in every city and community and America, and much, much worse if we don't keep them out
trump, We have to do this
trump, We have to go to the polls on November 3rd and the rest of you know what to do
trump, You know what to do
trump, Got to keep the White House
trump, Joe Biden's record can be summed up as four decades of betrayal, calamity, and failure
trump, He never did anything
trump, He was a Senator
trump, He was a Vice President
trump, He was before that something
trump, You know what's great President
trump, Trump was tough on this or he was tough
trump, They complained, never did anything about it
trump, He's been there for 43 years or 47 years
trump, He never did anything about it
trump, Biden's supported every globalist attack on the American worker let's make every country of the world rich but ourselves, including NAFTA, the disaster of NAFTA
trump, He wanted to go and TPP would have ruined our automobile industry
trump, Korea, I renegotiated the deal
trump, I took a horrible deal
trump, That was a Hillary Clinton special
trump, That was a Hillary Clinton special
trump, She said, We have to make this deal with South Korea
trump, It's going to mean 250,000 jobs
trump, And she was right for South Korea, 250,000
trump, And China's entry into the World Trade Organization was supported by sleepy Joe Biden
trump, That was one of the worst deals economically in the history of our country
trump, When China joined the World Trade Organization, they were flat line for decades
trump, They became like a rocket ship
trump, He voted for the war in Iraq
trump, He voted for mass amnesty for illegal aliens
trump, He supports sanctuary cities and now Biden wants to end immigration enforcement and he wants to require you to provide free healthcare for millions and millions of illegal aliens
trump, When I took early and decisive action to ban travel from China and protect Americans from the virus
trump, And as I said, Joe Biden, opposed my decision and called it hysteria, xenophobia
trump, He doesn't know what the word means, xenophobia and fear-mongering
trump, And then he apologized a month later
trump, He said he was wrong, but he didn't say it
trump, And they didn't cover it
trump, They didn't cover it
trump, On one of the single most important policy decisions of our lifetime, Joe Biden sided with China over America, that's closing the border
trump, He thought it was a terrible thing
trump, Remember, this was in January
trump, That's early, real, early, the end of January
trump, He thought it was a terrible thing
trump, When we close the border
trump, Too many people that were badly infected with COVID
trump, When the chips are down, Biden will always cave to the radical left
trump, He'll always bow to the angry mob and he will never protect you or your family and you know that
trump, Joe Biden will always let you down
trump, That's been his history
trump, At my direction early this year, the heroes of the U
trump,S
trump, military took out the world's top terrorist, the savage killer leader of ISIS al-Baghdadi and the number one terrorist, anywhere in the world, Qasem Soleimani
trump, We took them out
trump, Joe Biden opposed killing Soleimani
trump, He was vehemently… We killed this number one, terrorist
trump, He didn't like it
trump, You know why he didn't like it Because he thought it would be good politically, that didn't work out too well
trump, Just as he opposed the raid that killed Osama bin Laden
trump, He opposed it, you know that
trump, Biden is always on the wrong side of history, as said by people that are with him and worked with him
trump, He never made a correct foreign policy decision
trump, Biden is a puppet for China
trump, Son walked out with 1
trump,5 billion
trump, I think it's a little bit… Allowing them to rip off America for many years
trump, Now they're paying us billions and billions of dollars
trump, We give a lot of it to our farmers
trump, We have plenty leftover
trump, China is not exactly happy with me
trump, They pay us billions and billions of dollars
trump, And they targeted our great farmers
trump, And I took the money that they targeted, I took that money and I gave it to the farmers
trump, So they were even so they're okay
trump, Are you okay Come, Doctor, please
trump, Doctor
trump, Thank you
trump, These people some of the people are waiting for five days, especially in this location
trump, You take your time, darling, take your time
trump, Thank you very much
trump, Take your time
trump, Doctor, thank you, doctor
trump, Some people wait for four or five days
trump, That's incredible
trump, He never did anything against China, Joe Biden
trump, And that's why they desperately want him to win
trump, They want him to win so badly
trump, Iran wants him to win so badly
trump, Let me tell you, I'm going to make a very fast deal
trump, The best deal you've ever seen
trump, I've already made one with China, but I can make even more
trump, They want me to lose because they will own the United States if I lose
trump, Iran
trump, President Obama gave them 150 billion for nothing
trump, I told them
trump, And look what happened to Biden in Ukraine where his son's paid 83,000 a month
trump, And he was jobless
trump, Give me a break
trump, 83,000 a month
trump, More than anybody
trump, If Joe Biden were to become president an emboldened left, will launch a full scale assault on American life
trump, You know that
trump, They'll expel anyone who disagrees with them
trump, Look what happens when you disagree
trump, You use a term that's perfect and they're not happy with it
trump, They call you a racist
trump, They call you a horrible person
trump, They want to crush religious liberty
trump, They don't want religion
trump, Silence religious believers, indoctrinate your children with hateful and vicious lies about our country, subsidize late term abortion and after birth execution
trump, They want to take away your guns through the repeal of your Second Amendment, as sure as you're sitting there
trump, In fact, he even put the big gun grabber, Beto O'Rourke, who made a fool out of himself when he ran for president
trump, They put him in charge of guns
trump, Lots of luck on your Second Amendment
trump, Just remember I said, and hopefully you won't have to think back about it too much, because it won't matter
trump, Hopefully it won't matter
trump, No, Beto O'Rourke who wants to give up guns is in charge of the second amendment
trump, The Dems will also eliminate private health insurance, ban fracking, that's not good, and American energy will be in a position of weakness like it's never been before
trump, And that's after we built the greatest energy country anywhere in the world by far
trump, And they want to appoint Supreme Court justices who will utterly obliterate your Constitution
trump, And you now see how important the Supreme Court is
trump, Think if we didn't have two justices, that I think have been very, very, very good, but think how important it is
trump, Think how important it is
trump, And we still, I guess it's a, I don't know if it's an equal court, it's almost like we're a minority court, right It's almost like we're a minority court
trump, The recent Supreme Court cases prove that if Joe Biden is elected, he will stack the court with extremists, the forgotten men and women, together with everyone else
trump, We'll lose everything
trump, The forgotten men and women, I campaigned on the forgotten
trump, These are great people
trump, These are substantial people
trump, These are the elite
trump, By the way, you're the elite
trump, They're not the elite
trump, You're the elite
trump, Somebody two days ago said, Sir, the elite are really working hard on trying to destroy you
trump, I said, Yeah, why do you call them the elite, I said, why Well, they're not elite
trump, I look better than them
trump, Much more handsome
trump, Got better hair than they do
trump, I got nicer properties
trump, I got nicer houses
trump, I got nicer apartments
trump, I got nicer everything
trump, I ran for politics once, just once in my life
trump, And I became President of the United States
trump, And hopefully if you get out and vote, we'll do it one more time
trump, We won't even toy with them about three or four more times
trump, We won't
trump, We'll do it one more time
trump, We'll be two for two
trump, And our country will never, ever be stronger
trump, But I'll be soon announcing a new list of exceptional candidates for the United States Supreme Court
trump, And I'll choose only from that list
trump, A hundred percent, probably 25 incredible people, any one of which could be a great justice, any one of which
trump, And I did it last time and people loved when I did it
trump, And I'll only pick from that list
trump, Biden can't release his list because the names would be too extreme, too radical
trump, They wouldn't be acceptable, but they will be very radical people
trump, People don't understand, but we actually won on DACA yesterday
trump, We actually won because they basically said, You won, but you have to come back and redo it
trump, It's almost like, Gee, come on back, your paperwork was no good
trump, But we're going to be refiling, but don't let it get you
trump, Everything's going to work out really good
trump, Everything's going to work out good
trump, It was a great, it was great
trump, I mean, would have been nice if we won
trump, And Everybody said, Oh, you're going to win DACA
trump, You're going to win DACA
trump, That's easy
trump, You got to win DACA
trump, That's easy
trump, They all said it
trump, And they came back and they said, We don't like what you did with your paperwork, essentially
trump, So we're re-filing it
trump, Most people would say we lost
trump, We didn't lose
trump, We're going to refile it
trump, And everything is going to work out for the young people
trump, Most of whom aren't so young anymore, by the way
trump, But we're going to work it out for everybody
trump, Biden is fully controlled by the fringe of his party
trump, He is their pawn
trump, He doesn't even know where the hell he is
trump, Let's face it
trump, He installed socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
trump, To be in charge of his environmental policy and his energy
trump, Energy, you can forget petroleum
trump, How does Oklahoma feel about being petroleum free Not good, right Our country will have no energy
trump, Our country will have nothing
trump, Oklahoma, Texas, North Dakota, and many others will all be out of business
trump, I don't think that's going to work out too well, but she's actually in charge of environmental policy
trump, And you know what that means
trump, She doesn't even want to win
trump, She doesn't want those bird killing machines that go round and round
trump, You want to see a lot of birds that are dead Go under a windmill sometime
trump, She wants us to go back to the stone ages because she's got no sense, no credentials
trump, She's got a little charisma, not much, but she doesn't have a clue
trump, You know it
trump, But she's in charge of the environment
trump, No airplanes
trump, We can forget Boeing, I guess, come to think of it
trump, We talked about Boeing
trump, We could forget Boeing
trump, Let's cancel those brand new Air Force Ones
trump, Likewise, Representative Ilhan Omar is going to be very much involved in a Biden government
trump, They will put this hate filled America, bashing socialist, front and center in deciding the fate of your family and deciding the fate of your country
trump, I don't think she would like to make the government of our country just like the country from where she came, Somalia
trump, No government, no safety, no police, no nothing
trump, Just anarchy
trump, And now she's telling us how to run our country
trump, No thank you
trump, And I think we're going to have a big victory in the state of Minnesota, because they've had it
trump, They've had it
trump, Biden is a very willing Trojan horse for socialism
trump, When Biden first ran for president over 33 years ago, remember I used to call him 1 Joe, he never got more than 1 until Obama took him off the trash heap
trump, But he blatantly copied the speech of a British politician, even ripping off the man's personal biography and family history and claiming it was his own
trump, He forgot to say he was born in America
trump, Joe Biden is a shameless hypocrite
trump, Since 2003, he has delivered fawning eulogies to the funeral
trump, And at those funerals of three leading supporters of segregation, including a former member of the KKK, and yet Biden is now smearing as racist, tens of millions of people like yourselves
trump, Decent, hardworking Americans who he's never met
trump, And he frankly probably doesn't want to meet
trump, America should not take lectures on racial justice from Joe Biden
trump, Sleepy Joe
trump, A man who praised and partnered with segregationists, shift millions of black American jobs overseas, and everyone else's jobs too by the way
trump, If I didn't come along, we're building auto plants, we're building everything
trump, And there's never been a comeback like we're making right now
trump, Never been
trump, He hollowed out our middle class, including our black middle class with open borders
trump, Trapped young children in failing government schools, built cages
trump, Those cages were built by Obama and Biden
trump, Look it up, 2014
trump, And the fake news doesn't wanted to… Remember the picture of the cage A cage for children
trump, Remember the picture of the cage
trump, And they said President Trump
trump, And then they realized that was at a newspaper, 2014, the same… Built by Obama and Biden, the cages
trump, And they don't- And they don't want to report the way it is
trump, They know the way it is
trump, They're not stupid
trump, They sent young boys to fight in Iraq while the inner cities crumble, helped the big banks while hammering community leaders, and made our cities less safe and secure for all
trump, They've done a terrible job and they shouldn't be awarded
trump, They should not get rewarded with an election victory on November 3rd, that shouldn't happen
trump, It'll destroy this country
trump, Our country will be destroyed
trump, We've all worked too hard
trump, They don't know what the hell they're doing
trump, Some do actually, but in a very sinister way
trump, Virtually every policy that has hurt black Americans for half a century, Joe Biden has supported or enacted
trump, I've done more for the black community in four years than Joe Biden has done in 47 years
trump, Racial justice begins with Joe Biden's retirement from public life
trump, We are joined tonight by many outstanding Republican leaders
trump, These are great people
trump, We have two of our most distinguished, hardworking, wonderful friends, senators
trump, They do a great job
trump, Senator Jim Inhofe and James Lankford, please stand up
trump, Two very respected, I will tell you, two very respected people in Washington
trump, They're respected by everybody
trump, They do some job, and I'd have you come up, but you can relax
trump, I will say this
trump, Jim is running on November 3rd, Jim Inhofe
trump, He's running on November 3rd
trump, I don't even know
trump, Does he… Hey, James Does he have any competition Is somebody actually running against… There's no competition that he's got
trump, I know he's got James' support
trump, He's got my support
trump, I give him 100 endorsement
trump, Jim Inhofe
trump, I'd give it to James too, but he's not running this time
trump, Thank you
trump, Jim, great job
trump, Thank you very much
trump, What a great Senator he is
trump, Also here is a man who's respected by so many
trump, He's a little bit right of the people we've been talking about tonight
trump, Senator Tom Cotton of the great state of Arkansas
trump, Thank you, Tom
trump, They like you people
trump, Thank you, Tom
trump, Great job you're doing
trump, We're glad to be joined as well by a man that I've gotten to know
trump, He's done an incredible job with COVID and with everything else he touches, Governor Kevin Stitt
trump, Thank you both
trump, Thank you both for being here
trump, Thank you
trump, Lieutenant Governor Matt Pinnell
trump, Thanks, Matt
trump, Thanks, Matt
trump, And Representatives Frank Lucas, Tom Cole
trump, He's been here for a little while
trump, He's done an incredible job
trump, Markwayne Mullin, you don't want to fight with him
trump, I want to put him and Jim Jordan in a match together, I want to
trump, Kevin Hern, great job today, Kevin
trump, The great Jim Jordan, Jim Jordan
trump, Elise Stefanik
trump, Lee Zeldin
trump, Tom Emmer
trump, Tom, thank you
trump, These are warriors, folks
trump, These are great warriors
trump, During the fake impeachment trial, I'll tell you what
trump, There was nobody that could have done the job they've done
trump, That includes the Senate and the House
trump, These people are incredible
trump, David Kustoff
trump, David
trump, A great friend of mine
trump, Debbie Lesko, Arizona
trump, Great job, Debbie
trump, Great job
trump, And a man who's got very good genes, Greg Pence
trump, Thank you all
trump, Great job
trump, They're great… They are, they're warriors
trump, I'll tell you what
trump, Not every person is, but this group is, and we have a lot of them in Washington, and we'll send Jim Inhofe back, and we'll send all of them
trump, You'll send every one of them
trump, They have to come back because they have been fighting for us, and they've been fighting for you
trump, And they are just incredible, talented, tough, strong people that love your state a lot
trump, So thank you very much
trump, So we built the greatest single economy in the world
trump, And then we say not only the world, but actually in the history of the world, and they never even challenged me
trump, So I guess I'm right
trump, We did it
trump, We had the best numbers anybody's ever had
trump, We have the best employment numbers, African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, the best employment numbers in history, the best stock market numbers in history
trump, We were the envy of the world
trump, Everybody would come in to see me, presidents, prime minister, kings, queens, and dictators
trump, Dictators would even come in to say congratulations on the economy
trump, And then the plague came in, and now what we're doing is we're doing it again
trump, And it's going fast
trump, We have to have a lot of it done because people don't quite get it
trump, We're doing record business
trump, It's happening at a level and a speed that nobody can believe
trump, Two weeks ago, job numbers came in the single biggest number in the history of our country
trump, Last week, retail sales numbers came in, retail sales, the single greatest number in the history of our country
trump, So here's what's going to happen
trump, Here's what's going to happen
trump, They blame a President for anything
trump, When you see looters, even though we put them down, if we didn't stop them, nobody would because the other side will never stop them
trump, But they always blame a President
trump, Here's what's happening
trump, We're going up
trump, We're going up
trump, We're going up
trump, We're going to go up
trump, Then we're going to hit October
trump, We're going to be up
trump, We're going to be way up
trump, We're not going to be where we were, but in many ways, other than all of the horrible, horrible death that was so needlessly caused by a virus that should have been stopped where it originated, which was China
trump, But we're going to go up, up, up, up August, September, October, and people are going to say, Man, this guy is doing a good job
trump, He knows what he's doing
trump, I don't believe the fake news anymore
trump, And you're not going to want to lose your 401k's
trump, And you're not going to want to lose all of that wealth that you've accumulated, whether it's real estate wealth or any wealth you can think because it'll all come tumbling down if these people are put in charge
trump, And if they double and triple and quadruple your taxes, it will be a whole different ball game
trump, So I'm not putting any pressure on anybody, but in the end, we're going to have a phenomenal economy
trump, And next year we're going to have a good third quarter, but next year, and I said it before, will be the single greatest year economically that we've ever had, okay And if you see that happening, if you see it happening on November 3rd, you don't have the guts to vote against Trump
trump, You, even you, you don't have the guts to vote against Trump
trump, Say, Wait a minute, darling
trump, My 401k is higher than it was the last time
trump, I don't think I want to take a chance
trump, You're not going to want to do that
trump, The stock market has been the best
trump, Think of this, go back one week and go back 50 days
trump, In that 50 day period, it's the strongest 50 days in the history of the stock market, think of it
trump, And your wife or your husband says, Darling, I love you so much
trump, You are such a great investor
trump, And all you did is just keep the same crap you had the first time, right Darling, I love you so much
trump, You've always been a loser
trump, You've always lost money
trump, But now under President Trump, you're one of the greatest financial minds in our country
trump, And all you did was keep your stock What's wrong with having these great economic numbers What's wrong with having to close it down We saved millions of lives
trump, You know, a lot of people say we should have gone herd, let's go herd
trump, Ask them how are they doing in Brazil
trump, He's a great friend of mine, not good
trump, You heard about Sweden, right Too much
trump, Ask them how they do it in Sweden
trump, We saved millions of lives, and now it's time to open up, get back to work, okay Get back to work
trump, I recently signed groundbreaking criminal justice reform
trump, I secured record and permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities
trump, We slashed regulations and passed massive tax cuts to give black workers a pay raise like they've never, ever gotten before and lift up black owned businesses
trump, And I worked closely with a great senator also, friend of theirs, Senator Tim Scott, South Carolina, to create opportunity zones, which are doing incredibly
trump, And since then countless jobs and 100 billion of new investment, not government investment, have poured into 9,000 of our most distressed neighborhoods anywhere in the country
trump, 9,000, never happened before
trump, Tim Scott
trump, Today
trump, I'm also announcing that I have directed Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt to place the John Hope Franklin Reconciliation Park here in Tulsa on the African American Civil Rights Network
trump, So many of my friends have been asking me to do that
trump, So many of my friends, including these great politicians
trump, So we're going to do that
trump, It'll be done very quickly
trump, We will forever remember and honor the courageous people who helped build this state and this country
trump, Democrats are stoking division in order to distract from their decades of failure on schools, jobs, housing, justice, and crime
trump, In major city public schools run by Democrats, over two thirds of students are falling behind in reading and math
trump, And I think the numbers are worse than that
trump, But Democrats would rather deny these children the future they deserve than allow them to attend the charter, public, private, religious, or independent schools of their choice
trump, Pro choice, pro choice
trump, Pro choice for schools
trump, It's very popular, but some people it's like a disaster because what it does to certain unions that have a lot of power over the Democrats, even though they know it's wrong
trump, Republicans believe access to education is a civil right
trump, It's a civil rights
trump, 20 of 20 of the most dangerous cities in America are controlled by Democrats
trump, Think of that, 20 of 20
trump, And so is nearly every major city with a child poverty rate that's over 30
trump, They're controlled by Democrats
trump, We can name every one of them
trump, The murder rate in Baltimore and Detroit is higher than El Salvador, Guatemala, or even Afghanistan
trump, How are they doing, the Democrats running those cities Your whole country will be like that
trump, In 2018 alone, our police arrested nearly 12,000 people for murder and manslaughter, 25,000 people for rape, and nearly 1
trump,5 million for assault, violent assault
trump, The Democrats' push against our police will drive up crime and drive up costs at levels you'd never believe
trump, Thousands of innocent lives will be lost
trump, As President, I will always support the incredible men and women of law enforcement
trump, A vote for Republicans is a vote for better schools, better jobs, safer families, and stronger communities for all Americans
trump, There is a limit to what we can together achieve with four more years
trump, With your help, we will lift millions of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity
trump, That's what's happening, that's what's happening
trump, And that was happening at a level that nobody ever thought they'd see, it was happening before this COVID came in
trump, It was happening at a level that nobody believed possible
trump, And then China sent us the plague, thank you very much
trump, We will protect Medicare and Social Security for our great seniors
trump, And we'll always protect patients with pre-existing conditions
trump, Always, always
trump, We will appoint more judges to interpret the Constitution as written
trump, We will end deadly sanctuary cities
trump, We will finish the wall, which has now 212 miles built and beautiful
trump, 212 mile
trump, That's a lot of miles
trump, And let me tell you, you think that was an easy one, that was a tough one
trump, That party was totally unified against building the wall
trump, You know, in the end they gave up, you know what happened They realized it was a bad issue for them because these open borders
trump, I love when they fight for open borders because anybody that wants an open border coming in from rough areas, there's something wrong with those people
trump, So did you notice in the end it was like, Just leave us alone, build your wall, just leave us alone
trump, I said, Thank you very much
trump, And we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration that puts American workers first
trump, We will revitalize our cities, and we will build gleaming new roads, bridges, tunnels, and airports all across our land
trump, We will enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase, Made in the USA
trump, It's so beautiful, so beautiful
trump, Made in the USA
trump, That's happening too
trump, We have so many plants coming into Michigan and so many other states
trump, We have car plants coming in would have never come if I wasn't President, would have never come
trump, We will become the world's premier pharmacy, drug store, and medical manufacturer
trump, That's already started
trump, We're bringing it back
trump, We will keep America out of foolish, stupid, ridiculous foreign wars
trump, We will never hesitate to kill America's terrorist enemies
trump, When I took over, ISIS was all over the place, and I did something that I felt we should do
trump, And we have now obliterated, we have now captured 100 of the ISIS caliphate
trump, 100, 100
trump, And like our depleted military when I took over, like our empty shelves, medically, when I took over, like all of the things that when I took over, it was a mess, we have done a job
trump, You had to see what ISIS was doing
trump, They were getting bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger
trump, I came in, smaller, smaller, smaller
trump, Sir, we've just taken 100
trump, We will launch a new age of American ambition in space
trump, And the United States will be the first nation to land on Mars, good program
trump, You saw the beautiful rocket three weeks ago go up, beautiful
trump, We will defend privacy, free thought, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms
trump, And when you see those lunatics all over the streets, it's damn nice to have arms
trump, Damn nice
trump, Interesting how all of a sudden people understand it, right You couldn't sell it
trump, Now people understand it
trump, The right to keep and bear arms, we'll protect your second amendment
trump, Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America, we will support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States
trump, We uphold the principle of equal justice under the law
trump, We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life
trump, We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the true American way
trump, We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always salute our great American flag
trump, And we live by the words of our national motto, it will never change, In God we trust
trump, We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industries
trump, Won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world
trump, And we are making it greater and greater every single day
trump, Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country
trump, We are returning the power to you, the American people
trump, With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning
trump, We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God
trump, America will soon be thriving, like never before because, ladies and gentlemen of Oklahoma, the best is yet to come
trump, Together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you, Oklahoma
trump, Thank you
trump,
trump,ell, thank you very much
trump, And hello, Tupelo
trump, This is great to be with you tonight, the great state of Mississippi
trump, The great state of Mississippi, and by the way, the birthplace of a gentleman, not too many people heard of him, Elvis Presley
trump, But to be with thousands of incredible patriots who put their faith in God, family and country
trump, Right Four days from now, this state will head to the polls and vote to continue our extraordinary progress with your next governor, Republican Tate Reeves
trump, Great guy
trump, Great guy
trump, Under Republican leadership, jobs are booming, confidence is soaring, wages are rising, crime is falling, and our nation is stronger than ever before
trump, We're now an economic powerhouse
trump, We've never been in a position like it
trump, We've rebuilt our military and we have financial strength
trump, And by the way, for those of you with a thing called 401ks, the stock market hit, today, another all-time historic high
trump, Unemployment in Mississippi has reached the lowest rate ever recorded, ever recorded
trump, That's not bad
trump, That's not bad when you're on the debate stage and you say, We have the best economy we've ever had
trump, We have the best military we've ever had, the best unemployment and employment numbers we've ever had
trump, Said, Got the best president we've ever had
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you
trump, Four more years Four more years Four more years Four more years Four more years Four more years Four more years Thank you very much
trump, And very importantly, we've confirmed more than 158 brand new, beautiful federal judges to uphold our constitution as written
trump, In a very short while, we'll have 182 federal judges
trump, President Obama left us 142
trump, Thank you very much
trump, Thank you very much, President Obama
trump, He left us 142 openings
trump, Can you believe that You're supposed to leave none when you leave office, but that didn't work out too well
trump, And just days ago, the United States brought the world's number one terrorist leader to justice
trump, We have great military
trump, It was very, very depleted
trump, When I came into office, it was very, very depleted, but it ain't depleted anymore
trump, Yep
trump, al-Baghdadi, the founder and leader… Look, you've heard about it for a long time
trump, I kept saying, Where is al-Baghdadi That's the one I want
trump, Where is he And then, by the way, the following day, we got number two
trump, I don't know if you read about that
trump, But he was the founder and the leader of ISIS, and he's dead
trump, And Baghdadi, he was a Savage and soulless monster, but his reign of terror is over
trump, American special operators executed a masterful raid that ended his wretched life and punched out his ticket to hell, I guess you could say
trump, He spent his last miserable moments on Earth cowering and trembling and crying in fear of the American warrior that was right there going right up
trump, No enemy stands a chance against the righteous bite of the United States military, and Mississippi loves our military, that I can tell you
trump, And our military loves Mississippi
trump, America is winning again, and America is all, over the world, respected again
trump, It's about time
trump, But while we're creating jobs and killing terrorists, the Democrat party has gone completely insane
trump, The radical left is determined to transform America into a country you would not recognize
trump, We are the ones standing in their way, and we will never get out of their way
trump, It will be easy
trump, From even before we won the election, the far-left Democrats and the fake news media right back there… Look at all of them, oh
trump, It's too bad we get such good ratings because if we didn't, they wouldn't be here
trump, Look at how many
trump, It's like the Academy Awards before it failed
trump, Right And you know why it failed Because they disrespected us
trump, But the media and the Democrats have been engaged in a corrupt partnership, trying to impose their will and to thwart American democracy by any means necessary
trump, You see what's going on
trump, First, they engineered the Russia hoax
trump, That was a total hoax, the single greatest lies ever foisted upon the American people
trump, Then the Mueller witch hunt, it never ended
trump, With 18 angry Democrats and an unlimited budget, let's go get him
trump, That didn't work out too well, did it That fizzled
trump, And a lot of bad people along the way
trump, And now corrupt politicians, Nancy Pelosi- … and shifty Adam Schiff, Shifty
trump, And the media are continuing with the deranged impeachment witch hunt
trump, This is one I never thought I'd be involved in
trump, The word impeachment… To me, it's a dirty word, not a good word
trump, Totally phony deal
trump, They know it
trump, Everybody knows it, and that's why we've never had greater support than we have right now
trump, It's true
trump, And if you think you have a lot of people in this room, all you have to do is go outside
trump, You'll see a lot more people trying to get in
trump, So if anybody wants to give up your seat, please just walk out
trump, Anybody want to leave Because there really is
trump, There's no place better to have a rally, to have a good time, and to also, at the same time, be very serious than at a Trump rally, especially on Friday night in Mississippi
trump, We could have done this one on Monday night
trump, I said, Let's do Friday
trump, Right Yesterday, the Democrats voted to potentially nullify the votes of 63 million Americans, disgracing themselves and bringing shame upon the House of Representatives
trump, They've been plotting to overthrow the election since the moment I won
trump, But the people here that are highly sophisticated, though, long before I won
trump, 19 minutes after I took the oath of office, the horrible newspaper, fake, fake, fake Washington Post, declared, The campaign to impeach President Trump has just begun
trump, At least they gave us 19 minutes
trump, Yesterday's vote by the radical Democrats is an attack on democracy itself
trump, But I'll tell you, the Republicans are really strong, the strongest I've ever seen them, the most unified I've ever seen them
trump, Right The most unified I've ever seen them
trump, The American people are fed up with Democrat lies, hoaxes, and extremism
trump, The Democrats' outrageous conduct has created an angry majority that will vote many do-nothing Democrats out of office in 2020
trump, Make no mistake
trump, They are coming after the Republican party and me because I'm fighting for you
trump, They don't like it
trump, This is different
trump, They've never had anything like this
trump, Well, they've never had an election like 2016 either, have they They never have
trump, They've never quite figured it out
trump, You're the man
trump, And they know they can't win, so let's try and impeach him
trump, How about that crazy representative, Al Green, right You know, we got to impeach him because we can't beat him
trump, I don't think so
trump, Right I don't think so
trump, Al Green, he's another beauty
trump, The Democrats, the media, and the deep state are desperate to stop us
trump, And it's not me, it's us
trump, It's all of us
trump, It's 63 million, but it's much more than 63 million
trump, Much more
trump, And right now, our numbers are higher than they've ever been before
trump, They've never been this high
trump, But they want to stop us because they know we are here, and that's what we're doing, and that's what's taking up so much time
trump, We're draining the swamp in Washington
trump, Nothing terrifies Democrats more than the fact that all of their spying… Spying
trump, They actually spied on my campaign
trump, Can you believe it I mean, you know, they try and say, Well, we were actually just checking things out
trump, Oh, that's wonderful
trump, The lying, the falsifying over the past three years plus, before I ever even announced they were spying
trump, I guess they knew we were going to win, right But over that past more than three years is finally being exposed
trump, And remember this, that truth is a force of nature
trump, Desperate to conceal their misdeeds, the Democrats are now attacking us for calling out the grave corruption of the Bidens, just like they melted down when we pointed out crooked Hillary's shocking and very many misdeeds
trump, 33,000 emails
trump, 33,000 emails disappeared, but she said they only had to do with her working out at her daughter's wedding
trump, 33
trump, Lock her up
trump, Lock her up
trump, Lock her up
trump, Lock her up
trump, Lock her up
trump, Lock her up
trump, Lock her up
trump, Lock her up
trump, Lock her up
trump, Lock her up
trump, Lock her up
trump, Lock her up
trump, Lock her up
trump, She's a beauty
trump, How about last week Did you hear I don't know who Tulsi Gabbard is, but I know one thing
trump, She's not an agent of Russia
trump, And Jill Stein, she's a greenie
trump, That's fine
trump, We love the environment, everybody in this room
trump, You know, right now we have the cleanest air and the cleanest water that we've ever had, and yet we're number one in the world in energy, by far
trump, We took over
trump, But I don't know Jill Stein
trump, She ran last time
trump, I don't know, but I know she's not an agent of Russia
trump, And when Hillary made those statements, two statements, both of them, They work for Russia, they're agents of… I said, You know, when she made that statement about me three years ago, it took me two years to get out of that hoax statement
trump, She made it about them
trump, Everybody laughed because of what we proved
trump, But I'll tell you what, these are very bad people
trump, These are very dishonest people, and the media is worse than all of them
trump, But think about the preposterous hoax the Democrats are now trying to peddle
trump, I've just beaten, with no… Look, look, we didn't have too much political experience
trump, I did a good job, built lots of buildings all over the place, had great success in show business
trump, Just did one show
trump, It was called The Apprentice, and it was a big success
trump, 14 seasons
trump, And when I left, Crazy Arnold took over
trump, It didn't do too well
trump, It was dead
trump, It was dead from the first episode
trump, I saw him, I said, Oh, it's terrible
trump, What have they done to this beautiful show Arnold But think of it
trump, I've just beaten, with no political experience, the Clinton dynasty, the Bush dynasty, the President Barack Hussein Obama dynasty
trump, And President Obama worked harder at defeating me than crooked Hillary Clinton did, right He was all over the place
trump, It's the only time I've actually seen him work hard, when it came to trying to beat Trump
trump, True
trump, True
trump, Remember he said… Remember he said, He will not be president Well, that didn't work out so well
trump, And then they figured they could take us out a different way, very dishonesty, right, with the lying and the spying and the leaking
trump, And we are kicking their ass
trump, I'll tell you
trump, In the delusional Democrat fantasy, I'm now supposed to be afraid of someone called 1 Joe
trump, I used to call him 1 because you could never get 1 in the primaries
trump, Then he got brought out by Obama out of the trash heap, became vice president
trump, But we've now named him Very Slow, Sleepy Joe
trump, Very slow
trump, He's gotten slower and slower
trump, I'm afraid if he gets a nomination, he'll be so slow we'll have the lowest-rated debates in history as opposed to the highest-rated debates in history against crooked Hillary
trump, In fact, I don't even think that Sleepy Joe will get it
trump, But many people are running
trump, So, you know, it's so early
trump, I don't want to talk about their campaign
trump, Oh, did you hear Beto Beto Did you hear Beto Beto
trump, Oh, that poor bastard
trump, Well, poor, pathetic guy
trump, He was pathetic
trump, Remember the arms a-flailing Remember that You know, he ran against Ted Cruz
trump, Ted Cruz won
trump, He spent almost 100 million dollars, and Ted Cruz… And I helped Ted, and we campaigned together, and it was good
trump, But I used to watch him
trump, Then when he came onto the really big stage, this crazy stage, I noticed he was flailing with the arms, and he was standing on tables
trump, He was standing on countertops
trump, I said, Does he ever stand on the floor and speak But he's waving his arms and going crazy, and I said, What the hell is he doing What is he on And do you remember he made the statement that he was born for this Anybody that says he was born for this, they're in trouble
trump, I used to have guys come into my office, Sir, I'm the greatest salesman
trump, Nobody can sell… You know, the truth is anybody that says they're a great salesman, usually they're not a very good salesman
trump, It's true
trump, It's those sneaky ones in the back that don't talk, that you don't know about
trump, They're the ones
trump, But Beto was nasty, and he said that he was born for it, like he was born from heaven
trump, He came down
trump, And if that's the case, some really bad things happen, because he made a total fool out of himself
trump, And he came out of Texas, the great state of Texas
trump, He came out of Texas, a very hot political property, and he went back as cold as you can be
trump, So he was a nasty guy, but he had a couple of policies that don't work well in the state of Texas
trump, Right He was against religion
trump, He was against you having a gun
trump, And he was against oil
trump, So you come from Texas, you don't like religion, you don't like oil, and you don't have guns
trump, I don't know
trump, That's not a good combination in the state of Texas
trump, That's not good in Mississippi, either
trump, I don't know it's that good anywhere
trump, Nah, he went back home to Texas, and hopefully we won't be hearing about him for a long time
trump, It's amazing how cold you could get so quickly, but he was a nasty guy
trump, But in the twist… Oh, Alabama
trump, Love Alabama
trump, I love Alabama
trump, I love Alabama
trump, It's a great place
trump, But in the very twisted and corrupt world of Adam Schiff, after beating the entire political establishment, and that means Bush and that means Clinton and that means Obama, they have me supposedly saying to myself, Well, let's see
trump, I got a guy named Sleepy Joe Biden
trump, How do I beat him How do I beat him How do I beat this guy He's such a great
trump, Clinton, she was easy
trump, Right Obama was easy
trump, The Bush dynasty was
trump, But sleepy Joe, I'm worried about, right So then I said to myself, Gee, I guess there's only one way
trump, Let's call up Ukraine for help
trump, These people are sick
trump, These people are sick
trump, Now, these dishonest people will take the last little sliver and the first little sliver and they'll put it, because they're so damn dishonest, and they'll just say- … Let's use Ukraine for help
trump, That's what they're going to say
trump, And they won't show the laughter, and they won't show the sarcasm, and they won't show the fun because they're the most dishonorable people almost on earth
trump, It's a disgrace
trump, But we say it anyway
trump, And here's the good news
trump, The people get it
trump, So they have a brand new president in Ukraine
trump, Good guy, by the way
trump, And I call a brand new person, a man I have no idea who he is, and I'm on a phone, right And I know many people are on the phone because when you call the leaders of country, many people listen
trump, And I'm on the phone, and they want me to say to this brand new president, just got there, called to congratulate him, Please, could you help me please I don't know who he is
trump, I didn't know his name until I looked down the card, I see
trump, And he's a nice guy, and hopefully he's going to root out corruption because Ukraine has tremendous corruption problems
trump, And one of the reasons I held up money, very important, corruption
trump, But the other reason… Why isn't Germany and France and UK and all of these European nations that are right there… Why aren't they doing things that they're supposed to do Why is it always the United States So I made this call, had this wonderful call, and the transcript proves it was, as I said, perfect
trump, It was perfect
trump, It wasn't like almost… It was perfect
trump, It was totally appropriate
trump, I made it at the behest of people to say, Could you call and say hello Now I'm an honest person, anyway
trump, But do you think, when I'm making a call to a newly-elected president of a country, that I would say something improper when I know there are so many people listening on the line Many people
trump, Whoever the hell wants to listen, they listen, and they have me making some kind of a deal with all these people
trump, And remember, the new president of Ukraine is speaking to the United States of America, the president
trump, I guarantee he's got a lot of people listening, too
trump, These people are sick
trump,  no pressure
trump, They must think we're nuts, to be honest
trump, It's all a phony deal, this whole impeachment scam, to try to undermine the 2020 election and to de-legitimatize one of the greatest elections, maybe the greatest … I mean, let's give George Washington credit, but everybody expected he was going to win, that we've ever had
trump, So my phone call, which was totally perfect and appropriate, and if you want to read the transcript, you see how perfect it was, but they don't quit
trump, But what you should do is take a look at the behavior of Sleepy Joe
trump, So I quote, I said … Let me act like him
trump, I've got to speak really slow though, and … I said, ‘You're not getting a billion
trump,' I looked at them and I said, ‘I'm leaving in six hours
trump, If the prosecutor isn't fired, you're not getting the money
trump, You understand You're not getting the money
trump,' Then he goes, at the end … I didn't know he had this kind of energy
trump, He goes, Well, son of a bitch, he got fired
trump, You know, in a certain way, I was impressed because, I mean, I didn't think he had the energy, the brain power
trump, It's turned out he doesn't
trump, By the way, he's dropping like a rock
trump, When you're at 1, there's always a reason
trump, He should be there fairly soon
trump, As you know, the Ukrainian prosecutor that Biden got fired after threatening to withhold, I think it was 1 billion or something in aid, was the prosecutor investigating his son's company, that was paying Hunter Biden, a guy just got thrown out of the Navy … He was paying them millions of dollars, even though, working for an energy company, he had no experience with energy
trump, He knew less about it than this young … How old are you Six
trump, This young, beautiful person in front of me
trump, Six
trump, And this young six-year-old is smarter, so I think I'd basically go with her
trump, So what is it all about It's called a payoff, but you know what The fake news, they apologize
trump, I watched this horrible guy who gets lousy ratings, Anderson Cooper
trump, Well, the hatred, I mean, between him and Fredo
trump, You've got Fredo and … That's Cuomo, Fredo
trump, I call him Fredo, like from the movie
trump, Now I watched Anderson Cooper and I watched him apologize for even asking the question to Biden
trump, The good news is Biden didn't know too much about what the hell he was talking about
trump, Remember Biden said, I don't know these people
trump, I don't know them
trump, I don't know them
trump,  we're dealing with life, right He never spoke to him
trump, Unfortunately, the next day … In the world of the internet, in the world of smart people … That's why I like Beto, he wasn't smart, couldn't handle it
trump, I told my wife, I said, See, it's not so easy
trump, I told our great First Lady tonight, who people love
trump, They love her
trump, When Beto quit, he quit like a dog
trump, When he quit I said, See, people think this is easy
trump, This isn't easy, but it just worked out that way
trump, But Biden said, I never met the people, never met the gentlemen
trump, Unfortunately, in about 10 seconds, a picture came out where they're playing golf together, but he never met him
trump, So now you'll ask him, he'll say, No, we played around a golf
trump, We were together for three hours
trump, I never mentioned the fact that they're paying my son millions
trump, Oh, no, no, no
trump, … Well, they might be watching us
trump, I guess they do watch us
trump, He used to interview me
trump, He was so nice
trump, Prior to running for politics, he was so nice to me
trump, It was like they were love fests, but I don't want anything to do with him
trump, They were love fests
trump, What a thought
trump, He's weak
trump, He's a weak person, but they're all weak
trump, But let me just tell you something
trump, We need honesty with our media
trump, We need honesty, because the New York Times, the Washington Post … And by the way, I don't know, you probably read it
trump, We threw them out at the White House
trump, We don't show them anymore
trump, If somebody wants to go and buy them we threw them out
trump, And they came into my office and then I got to get back to this guy
trump, Where's Hunter Where's Hunter We had a tee shirt made, Where's Hunter Where's Hunter Poor Hunter
trump, He then came out, he did the Morning Show
trump, That was the last we've seen of Hunter
trump, That wasn't good
trump, The morning of his father's very bad debate, but it's, where is Hunter But before I say the final thing on Hunter and then we put him to rest for a while, we got rid of the Washington Post and the failing New York Times
trump, We got rid of them, right We don't have them in the White House
trump, I said, No, you could … People can go out and buy them, but we don't … We used to have them stacked up, and I'd go in and I'd see a meeting with my people and they're dealing with China, South Korea, or somebody
trump, And I'd go into these offices I'd see 10 or 15 of them packed up all over the place, the Washington Post, and the New York Times
trump, I keep trying to figure out who's worse
trump, And one day it's the Times, one day it's the Post
trump, It's like top each other, they're so bad
trump, It's so phony
trump, In my opinion, it's virtually corrupt
trump, I've never seen it
trump, You never have a good story
trump, I mean, even when we got al-Baghdadi, the Washington Post had a story that he was like a great religious cleric
trump, Where did that come from The other thing, if Obama would have done it … because, look
trump, This guy built ISIS
trump, The caliphate, it was the size physically of Ohio, the state of Ohio, the great state of Ohio
trump, That's a big, lot of land
trump, 7 million people, and they were the ones, the orange jumpsuits
trump, I called a lot of the parents after we did this and I talked to them and they were … How can you be happy But they were so thrilled that we got this animal
trump, They were so thrilled
trump, But you know what And you know what We don't do it for … We do it because it's right
trump, That story was a massive story
trump, That was the biggest, maybe the biggest, one of the biggest, ever
trump, Bigger than anything
trump, That story disappeared so fast
trump, Done
trump, And that's okay
trump, I didn't do it for the story
trump, I did it because it's the right thing to do
trump, But if I were a Democrat, they'd be talking about that story for weeks
trump, With me, they don't even want to … They actually played it down
trump, And actually, and I'm happy about this, Conan the dog got more publicity than me
trump, And I'm very happy with that
trump, I'm very … Conan is incredible
trump, And Conan's coming to the White House in a few weeks
trump, But it is true
trump, Did you ever see a story disappear so fast I mean, if Obama had that story, that thing would be going on for another seven months
trump, They'd be talking about his bravery
trump, Oh, so bravery
trump, But again, 142 judges he gave us
trump, Remember that
trump, How can you be a great … They always say the most important thing a president can do is federal judges
trump, We got two Supreme Courts
trump, Great ones
trump, Great judge
trump, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, great judges
trump, By the way, did you ever see any human being treated worse than now-Justice Kavanaugh Did anybody ever Was any human being by these people, these horrible, horrible people that we have to deal with Anyway, just to finish
trump, So Hunter then goes to China
trump, Now I'm dealing with China right now
trump, They don't like me too much
trump, They dream about the day when somebody else … And would they like to have … How about this You give this son, who has zero experience with investing, too, you give him 1
trump,5 billion to invest, meaning he makes millions and millions of dollars, and the biggest guys on Wall Street can't get it
trump, He walks out with 1
trump,5 billion
trump, And then there are other places also, I understand
trump, Folks, it's disgraceful that the press doesn't cover it for what it is
trump, It's a payoff
trump, It's a payoff
trump, And how would you like to have Sleepy Joe, with the son getting all of this money from China, become president and take over the China deal They are not liking me
trump, They had the worst year that they've had in 57 years
trump, Their supply chain is broken up like scrambled eggs and they want to make a deal because those tariffs have given us millions of dollars and billions now, billions and billions of dollars
trump, We're taking billions and billions of dollars, and you know what we're doing with some of it Just a small portion, but 100, they're taking care of … Our farmers got 16 billion last year and 12 billion the year before because they targeted our farmers, because they know the farmers love Trump and Trump loves the farmers
trump, So they targeted them and they brought the 16 billion down to practically nothing
trump, And they thought our farmers would say, Oh, we don't like Trump
trump, They did just the opposite
trump, They said, We know he's doing the right thing because we've been ripped off for so many years
trump, But I said to him, I said to Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Purdue, a great guy I said, Sonny, how much did they spend buying our corn and soy beans and all of our agricultural product He said, Sir, 16 billion
trump, I said, Good, I'll make it up
trump, And we're going to have a lot leftover
trump, So we will have, pretty soon, over 100 billion in money paid into the United States Treasury by a country that never gave us 25 cents
trump, They only took
trump, They only took
trump, So when I said to the farmers, We're going to send you 16 billion, and it's already been sent
trump, And it's been split into 12 billion the year before
trump, I mean, think of that, 28 billion
trump, I said, Compliments of China
trump, And we had a lot left over
trump, Not bad, right Not bad
trump, You think Obama would do that I don't think so
trump, You think Hillary would do that I don't think so
trump, You think Sleepy Joe would do that I don't think so
trump, He wouldn't know what you're talking about
trump, On Tuesday, the proud people of Mississippi will send Democrats a clear message
trump, It's very important for this reason, as well as the fact that you have a great gentleman in your midst
trump, But you have to reject their extremism and their socialism and their corruption
trump, They're corrupt
trump, Adam Schiff is a corrupt politician
trump, You know when he made that phony speech where he made up a really horrible speech and said that I said it, I said, Oh, I'm going to sue him
trump, They said, Sir, I'm sorry
trump, You can't
trump, He's got total immunity because he made it in Congress
trump, Can you believe this But here's the good news
trump, At least we have a forum, we have a place we can talk so everyone knows what's going on
trump, A bunch of phony people, but this is why we have to send a signal and why you have to make Tate Reeves your great, new Republican … Right Republican governor, right Hey, he's a great guy, too
trump, And all I know is he's loved and respected by your current governor, because Phil is some piece of work
trump, Phil is so confident
trump, I wanted Phil to run for a certain office, then I wanted him to do something
trump, I've tried to get him, but some guys are confident
trump, Phil said, No sir, I've been doing this all my life
trump, I love the people
trump, He built the most beautiful African-American museum
trump, Phil, he's the greatest, but he built the most beautiful … But he's got confidence
trump, And he said, No sir, I'd been doing it
trump, I don't really want to do that
trump, In other words, he said, That's enough
trump, … Oh, we love our police, right I love our police
trump, We love our police
trump, He'll oppose sanctuary cities, which is just terrible
trump, They're terrible
trump, And Tate will always defend your Second Amendment
trump, So Tate's running against a liberal Democrat named Jim Hood
trump, Now all I know about Jim Hood is he fought very hard to elect crooked Hillary Clinton and Barack Hussein Obama
trump, Isn't that nice He wanted Obama to win so badly and then he wanted Hillary to win
trump, And that's not the kind of guy we need here
trump, Not in Mississippi
trump, He's supported by extreme leftists like Stacey Abrams, who, by the way went down to defeat in front of a terrific gentlemen from the great state of Georgia, Brian Kemp
trump, And they came in with … Oh, they brought them all
trump, They had President Obama, they had Michelle Obama, they had Oprah Winfrey
trump, They came in, and all he had was Donald Trump, and we won
trump, We won, fairly easily
trump, But Stacey Abrams wants to give illegal aliens the right to vote
trump, Do you believe this I mean, some of these people, they want to give them education
trump, They want to give them this
trump, They want to give them free healthcare
trump, They want to give these people, that come into our country illegally all benefits, and he opposed our travel ban, which is so important that we won in the United States Supreme Court to keep terrorists the hell out of our country
trump, And Jim Hood went to the United Nations and opposed your right to self-defense
trump, If you don't want a far left Democrat running Mississippi … Wait a minute
trump, How's this guy I can't believe this is a competitive race
trump, It's embarrassing
trump, I'm talking to Mississippi
trump, I'm talking to Mississippi
trump, I can't believe it
trump, I don't think that he's going to be the right guy
trump, I think the guy that you want is Tate Reeves
trump, He's going to be fantastic
trump, He will be a great, great governor
trump, Tate, come on up
trump, Tate
trump, Thank you, Tate
trump, Tuesday, go out and vote for Tate
trump, He'll never let you down
trump, And don't kid yourself
trump, Your Second Amendment is under attack, but not with him
trump, It's under attack
trump, So we're also joined tonight by a man who is truly, and I've sort of said it a lot, but he's been a great governor and he loves your state
trump, He loves the people of this great state, Governor Phil Bryant
trump, Where's Phil Come up, Phil
trump, Come up
trump, Oh, he's central casting
trump, Look at him
trump, Come here, Phil
trump, Thank you, Phil
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you, my Phil
trump, What a job
trump, What a great job
trump, You have to continue that whole thing going forward
trump, So another man who's a warrior is a friend of mine
trump, Whenever there's a problem, he's there
trump, He's always there
trump, He'll be right at the front
trump, He is tough
trump, He is smart
trump, He's brilliant, actually
trump, And he loves this state and he loves you people
trump, Senator Roger Wicker
trump, Roger
trump, Thanks, Roger
trump, Thank you, Roger
trump, And somebody, I'll call her up because, believe it or not, she's running with me
trump, She just ran
trump, I said, Cindy, you just ran
trump, You just won
trump, She said, No, I have to do it again
trump, She's running in 2020
trump, I thought she'd have six years
trump, I said, Cindy, it's only like a year
trump, Cindy Hyde-Smith
trump, She's incredible
trump, She's tough and smart and strong, and she's with us all the way
trump, Cindy Hyde-Smith
trump,  Trent Kelly, Michael Guest
trump, Incredible people
trump, And your next Lieutenant Governor, Delbert Hosemann
trump, Your next Attorney General, Lynn Fitch
trump, Your next Secretary of State, Michael Watson
trump, Great people
trump, Your next State Treasure, David McRae
trump, State Auditor, Shad White
trump, Agriculture Commissioner, Andy Gipson
trump, Insurance Commissioner, Mike Chaney
trump, And former governor, a man that nobody's ever heard of in this room, I'm sure, but the truth is he's a legend in politics and a great guy
trump, He's a great guy, Haley Barbour
trump, … Hourly earnings are up 9 in Mississippi since the election
trump, Under the previous two administrations, we lost 60,000 factories in our country
trump, Under my administration, we've already added nearly 10,000 new factories, and many more are coming in as we speak
trump, To get relief to working families, we passed massive tax cuts on average 2,000 to 2,500 per family, bringing almost 1 trillion back home to our shores
trump, What's happening You couldn't get the money
trump, The big companies, they couldn't get their money back both bureaucratically and from a tax standpoint
trump, They brought back almost 1 trillion now because of us
trump, All put to work
trump, We slashed the largest number in history of job-killing regulations, and we ended the war on American energy
trump, We are now the number one producer of energy by far anywhere in the world
trump, For decades, you saw corrupt politicians take money from lobbyists to impose catastrophic trade deals
trump, Mississippi lost 40 of all manufacturing jobs after the twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance into the World Trade Organization
trump, Two of the worst deals ever made by our country
trump, 100,000 Mississippi jobs were wiped away just like that, and that's awful, and a big price to pay for Washington's disloyalty to the American worker
trump, That's what it was
trump, It was disloyalty, stupidity, corruption, lots of reasons
trump, But now you finally have a President who is loyal to you, and I am
trump, I'm a fighter for your jobs, for your wages, your factories, your families, and your dignity
trump, We're stopping China from ripping us off
trump, We're stopping all of these other countries from taking advantage of the United States where we lose our money, we lose our wealth, we lose our jobs, we close our factories
trump, That's not happening anymore
trump, It's reversed
trump, We were the sucker country for years and years, but we are not the sucker country anymore, and they all know it
trump, We're replacing NAFTA … and that was a disaster, NAFTA … with the brand new US, Mexico, Canada agreement if Nancy Pelosi will ever put it up to a vote, which is questionable
trump, Nervous Nancy, she doesn't want to give the people of our country a victory
trump, She's very busy doing other things
trump, Having fun
trump, The USMCA will be a massive victory for Mississippi's farmers and also includes powerful protections for Mississippi auto workers, manufacturers, and everybody else
trump, It's a great agreement
trump, About time we got rid of NAFTA
trump, The do-nothing Democrats need to stop their madness and pass the USMCA right now
trump, The last administration's horrendous Trans-Pacific Partnership would have destroyed the US auto industry, but I proudly, first thing, withdrew from that job-killing calamity
trump, Under our policies, Toyota has just announced a 170 million investment in Mississippi and 400 new jobs at its facility … did you ever hear of this place … Blue Springs
trump, Blue Springs
trump, Before my election, our leaders used the great American middle class as a piggy bank to fund their delusional global projects all over the world
trump, We take care of other people
trump, We take care of other countries, but we don't take care of our own
trump, They knowingly decimated American manufacturing to promote economic growth in foreign countries
trump, They deployed our military to protect … think of this … immensely wealthy nations, subsidizing their welfare states with your money
trump, I ask those wealthy nations now, I respectfully the other day said to the King of Saudi Arabia, King, we're going to help you, but you've got to pay
trump, And he was great
trump, No, he was great
trump, He was great
trump, He said, But nobody has ever asked before
trump, I said, But I'm asking
trump, And billions of dollars will come in, and we're protecting a great ally
trump, We have a country that spends billions and billions of dollars in our country buying military and other things
trump, But we said, You're very wealthy
trump, You have to pay, and they're going to pay
trump, And that's true with many countries by the way
trump, That's true with many countries
trump, They never respected us
trump, They could never believe it
trump, I said to one country … I have great respect for the Prime Minister of Japan
trump, I said to Prime Minister, I said, How did you get away with this for so long And he looked at me and he couldn't really answer it because how the hell did this happen We're protecting 94 countries
trump, Ask China, How many countries are you protecting President Xi And they look at me like, What a stupid question
trump, We protect one
trump, China
trump, You ask President Putin, How many countries are you protecting President Putin And he looks and he goes, Russia
trump, You ask other countries … we're protecting at least 94
trump, In fact, so many they can't even tell me
trump, I've been trying to get an answer for four months
trump, So many they can't even tell
trump, It's crazy, but it's all beautiful the way it's happening
trump, A lot of good things are happening
trump, But these same politicians poured precious American blood and treasure into the sands of the Middle East while allowing our cities to fall into disrepair and decay
trump, Our failed ruling class believed it was their right to rule over you, to take your money, to take your jobs, to redistribute your wealth all over the globe, wherever they wanted it
trump, But I don't like that
trump, I don't like that
trump, The great sellout has ended, and it ended the day I took the oath of office
trump, That was quite a day
trump, After years of building up foreign nations, we are finally building up our nation
trump, We are finally putting America first
trump, Our policy of never-ending war, regime change and nation-building is being replaced by the clear-eyed pursuit of American interests
trump, It is the job of our military to protect our security, not to be the policemen of the world
trump, Proving the wisdom of this approach, we recently secured a permanent ceasefire in Northern Syria without spilling one drop of American blood
trump, Not one drop
trump, Actually, I have to be honest
trump, One soldier stepped on a nail
trump, That's true
trump, I said, Don't tell the press that because they'll say, but one soldier stepped in a nail
trump, I said, How bad was it It's okay
trump, I said, Don't mention it please
trump, They always like to mention exactly what happened
trump, You can take it a little bit low key
trump, Stepped on a nail
trump, Not a drop of blood
trump, And we don't have to defend the borders between Turkey and Syria
trump, They've been fighting for 1000 years
trump, But what we do is we did keep the oil, if you don't mind
trump, We kept the oil
trump, We kept the oil
trump, And we'll distribute that oil, we'll help out the Kurds, and we'll help out other people
trump, We'll also help out ourselves if that's okay
trump, Past leaders, foolish military adventures turned far away nations into very, very dangerous war zones
trump, Then they demanded that American citizens accept unlimited migration from those terror-afflicted nations and regions
trump, I don't think so
trump, I don't think so
trump, We did not fight them over there only to invite them over here
trump, We don't want to do that
trump, To protect our communities, my administration restricted migration from terror-prone nations and implemented the toughest ever vetting procedures
trump, Toughest ever that we've ever had
trump, No issue has ever been so horribly discarded by a party as that issue by the Democrats
trump, They want open borders, which mean crime
trump, They want sanctuary cities, which means crime and drugs and death
trump, After bleeding the middle class dry, Democrats threw open our borders to the world, flooding our communities with poisonous drugs and criminal cartels
trump, Republicans believe in strong borders and safe communities
trump, We are now building a wall
trump, We're building it
trump, We're building it
trump, And you think that was easy The Democrats, they didn't want that wall
trump, I got money for everything, but when it came to the wall, not 25 cents
trump, Not 25 cents
trump, But we gave the military a lot of money and we took it from the military and we took it from here, we took it from there
trump, Or we had to go to court and all of a sudden we start winning cases
trump, We're winning cases now
trump, Winning a lot of cases
trump, But the wall is going up rapidly
trump, It's going up rapidly
trump, And this is a very serious wall
trump, This is the exact everything they wanted
trump, I went to the border patrol, incredible people and ICE
trump, Incredible people, tough people
trump, They love our country
trump, And I said, Give me the specifications for the wall
trump, They said, Well sir, we'd like steel, but would also like concrete and would also like rebar
trump, I said, Well, what do you want Which one So I did all three because it's a different form of cutting
trump, You can cut through steel, but you can't through the concrete and then you can't through the hardened rebar
trump, We got it all
trump, And we also need see-through, sir
trump, Got to see who's on the other side
trump, That makes sense, right Not just concrete
trump, It's more expensive what we're doing, but we're giving and we're building … we should have anywhere from 400 to almost 500 miles of wall built by the end of next year
trump, It's going up fast
trump, In all the right areas
trump, In all the right areas
trump, That was a tough one
trump, And the Army Corps of Engineers is building their hearts out
trump, They're great
trump, Great people
trump, We believe in keeping terrorists and criminals and drug dealers the hell out of our country
trump, And thanks to our tireless efforts on the Southern Border, tough place, illegal crossings have dropped 60 since May, and we are faster than ever securing the Southern Border
trump, And soon it will be, when the wall is completed, secure like it's never been before
trump, And I want to thank the country of Mexico
trump, They right now have 27,000 soldiers on our borders
trump, 27,000
trump, You know what that is And they are keeping people out
trump, And I want to thank the President of Mexico
trump, He's an excellent person, great man
trump, And we appreciate it
trump, And the reason is that our Democrats won't even approve things called loopholes
trump, They're loopholes
trump, That's a horrible name, right That means it's a loophole
trump, That means you can come in illegally and lots of things
trump, Catch and release
trump, You catch them
trump, Then you've got to release them
trump, By law you've got to release them or they'll arrest the border patrol agent if they don't release
trump, It's crazy
trump, But we could end this in 15 minutes, but they don't want to do it
trump, They don't want to do it
trump, They're obstructionists
trump, They're colluders
trump, And we can't let it happen
trump, That's why you have to go with Tate Reeves
trump, Tate's going to send a big signal, by the way
trump, It's a big signal
trump, It's great for you
trump, He's going to be a great governor
trump, It also sends a big signal to these radical left, crazy Democrats
trump, It's very important that Tate wins
trump, Very important
trump, We're also fighting deadly sanctuary cities with the help of states like Mississippi, which has banned sanctuary cities because Phil Bryant said, We're not going to have them, and Roger Wicker said, We're not going to have them
trump, And Cindy said, We're not going to have them
trump, Democrats' sanctuary cities forced the release of dangerous criminal aliens onto our streets
trump, If you want a governor who will stand proudly with the heroes of ICE … and they are heroes, I wouldn't want their job
trump, MS-13, they walk right into those nests … they call them a nest … and they start swinging
trump, You never saw anything like it
trump, I'll say, You know what Better you than me
trump, Let's see who would do good
trump, He'd do good
trump, That guy
trump, That guy would do good
trump, Most of you wouldn't do too good
trump, No
trump, I mean, these guys are tough guys and they love our country
trump, Who would do it They're moving thousands of people from MS-13
trump, These gangs are the worst people
trump, These people, these are not human beings
trump, You know, I said that once before and this crazy Nancy Pelosi said, How dare you say they're not human You ever see these people And they slice people up with a knife because it's more painful than using a gun
trump, And then I have to defend myself when I say they're animals
trump, But you know what I never changed
trump, I didn't say, Oh, I'd like to apologize
trump, I'd like to apologize
trump, Crazy Nancy
trump, And you got to look at her district in San Francisco
trump, She's spending all her time on this crap or this impeachment stuff
trump, Take a look at what's happening to the great city, once, of San Francisco
trump, It's thousands and thousands of tents and drugs and needles and everything you can imagine floating in the streets in the best neighborhoods
trump, Nancy Pelosi, go home and fix your district, Nancy
trump, Go home and fix your district
trump, Go home and fix your district
trump, If you want a governor who will stand proudly with the heroes of ICE and border patrol, vote for Tate Reeves
trump, Tuesday
trump, Got to get out
trump, You got to get out
trump, Got to send the signal
trump, Let it be a big victory too
trump, The Democrat party has never been more extreme, you know that, than it is today
trump, The Democrat healthcare agenda would obliterate Medicare
trump, I will always protect Medicare for our seniors, and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions
trump, Always
trump, We'll always take care of them
trump, Virtually every Democrat also now supports late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up until the moment of birth
trump, Well, the governor of Virginia executed a baby
trump, Remember that whole thing
trump, After birth, after birth
trump, Some people never heard of it
trump, He said the baby is born and then he starts talking to the mother
trump, Nobody ever heard that
trump, That is why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God
trump, Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption
trump, The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream
trump, Nobody has done more for the African American community than the Republican party
trump, And we're also the party of Abraham Lincoln
trump, We can't forget that
trump, People forget
trump, Abraham Lincoln
trump, Honest Abe
trump, To lift up distressed communities, we created opportunities zones
trump, So incredible
trump, So successful
trump, Including 100 new opportunity zones right now in Mississippi where money is now flowing in to build and to fix
trump, And Tim Scott, I give him so much credit from the great state of South Carolina choices
trump, They can go out, get a doctor, we pay the bill, and they don't have to wait six weeks, four weeks, two weeks
trump, We had people waiting in line
trump, They weren't very sick
trump, By the time they saw the doctor, they were terminally ill
trump, Now they go on and they go and they go outside and they find a doctor and we take care of our great veterans
trump, The great rebuilding of the American Armed Forces has included massive investments in the military and facilities in Biloxi and Gulfport and Jackson and Starkville
trump, And Roger has been fantastic
trump, And Cindy Hyde-Smith has been fantastic
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you
trump, To protect America's security, I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal
trump, It's not the same country anymore
trump, Nothing's easy, but it's not the same
trump, And I recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem
trump, For years you watch as your politicians apologize for America
trump, Now you have a President who is standing up for America, and we are standing up for the people of Mississippi
trump, The next step to victory begins on Tuesday right here in your great state
trump, With your support we will show the corrupt Democrats that the American people are not ever going to back down from perhaps the greatest victory in political history
trump, And you know today with the new stock market at an all-time high, it's … I will tell you something … if we didn't win this election, that stock market would be in one-half
trump, It was heading in the wrong direction
trump, It was going to fail
trump, And if they ever did anything bad, if they ever do anything bad to us, if they ever succeed in their wildest dream, which will never let them happen, that stock market will crash like you've never seen a crash before
trump, And you will not be happy with your 401ks like you're happy right now because they don't know what they're doing
trump, They don't know what they're doing
trump, And I'd like to speak well, but the leadership, they have no clue
trump, They're just very vicious people
trump, Actually, they're sort of mentally violent people, but we've got it under control
trump, It always helps when you didn't do anything wrong
trump, I always say, How do you impeach a President who didn't do anything wrong So we're going to send a signal by sending a terrific new Republican governor to Jackson
trump, On Tuesday, you're going to get out and you're going to vote, and you're going to give up whatever you have to give up
trump, You're going to leave work maybe a little early or maybe get there a little late
trump, Tell your boss I said it was okay
trump, I will give you a pardon if I have to
trump, I'll give you a one-hour pardon
trump, But with your help, we will lift millions more of our great citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity
trump, Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration
trump, And you have great congressmen here and I'll tell you, I want to appreciate it, fellas
trump, Warriors, you're warriors
trump, You are warriors
trump, What was it 196 for and nothing against, right That doesn't happen with Republicans
trump, It doesn't happen
trump, I always complain
trump, I always say the Democrats are lousy politicians
trump, They have lousy policies
trump, Open borders, sanctuary cities, but they have one thing
trump, They stick together and they're vicious
trump, The Republicans have great policy
trump, In many ways they're better politicians, but they're not as vicious
trump, Thank you, darling
trump, I appreciate it
trump, They're not as vicious, but they have a tendency to split apart
trump, The Democrats don't seem to have any Mitt Romneys
trump, We do
trump, We do
trump, I don't know
trump, Maybe he'll get better
trump, Maybe he'll get better
trump, We'll see
trump, We'll see what happens
trump, Maybe he'll get better
trump, Just let it be fair, but they don't have that
trump, We will enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with those beautiful, beautiful words, ‘Made in the USA
trump,' Made in America
trump, We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America
trump, Can you believe that Within 10 years it will be over
trump, When they told me that, I said, That's incredible
trump, We're going to end the AIDS epidemic within 10 years
trump, It's funded
trump, Nobody would have thought we could do that, but we're doing it
trump, We'll have it ended in America in 10 years
trump, The AIDS epidemic
trump, Who would've thought We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms
trump, Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America
trump, We support, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States
trump, We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement
trump, We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life
trump, We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way
trump, We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag
trump, And we live by the words of our national motto and we always will
trump, You'll never see it disappear
trump, In God We Trust
trump, We stand on the shoulders of American Patriots who crossed the oceans, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industry, pioneered technology, won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world
trump, And today it's greater than ever before
trump, Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country
trump, That's what we're doing
trump, That's what happened in 2016
trump, We are returning power to you, the American people
trump, With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working
trump, We are going to keep on fighting
trump, And we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning
trump, We'll get so tired of winning
trump, I don't know, Mississippi
trump, You're winning
trump, You had the best year you've ever had
trump, You have the best, Mississippi, the best year you've ever had in the history of our country
trump, Mississippi
trump, Your statistic
trump, Mississippi, aren't you getting tired of winning I guess not
trump, So Phil doesn't come to me and say, Sir, please, we're willing too much
trump, The people of Mississippi can't take it anymore
trump, I don't think you'll ever have to make that trip
trump, I don't think he's ever going to have to, and I don't think Tate will ever have to make that trip
trump, We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God
trump, America is thriving like never before
trump, And ladies and gentlemen of Mississippi, the best is yet to come
trump, Because together we will make America wealthy again
trump, We will make America strong again
trump, We will make America proud again
trump, We will make America safe again
trump, And we will make America great again
trump, Thank you, Mississippi
trump, Thank you
trump,
trump,Thank you
trump, Thank you
trump, I love New Jersey and I'm thrilled to be back right here in the Garden State
trump, Thank you
trump, The Garden State
trump, Together we're achieving historic victories for New Jersey families
trump, You see it every single day
trump, The New Jersey unemployment rate has reached the lowest of all time
trump, More people are working today in the state of New Jersey than ever before
trump, I have to tell you more people, almost 160 million, are working right now in the United States
trump, That's the highest level of employment in the history of our country
trump, A lot of countries aren't doing so well, just so you understand
trump, Tomorrow we will replace the NAFTA nightmare, one of the worst trade deals ever in history, with the incredible brand new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the USMCA
trump, A massive win for New Jersey workers, New Jersey farmers, New Jersey union people, New Jersey manufacturers and everybody
trump, Weeks ago we also signed a fantastic new trade agreement with China that will boost New Jersey exports and defend New Jersey jobs
trump, 250 billion coming in
trump, Oh that's going to be so nice
trump, We're restoring America's industrial might like never before
trump, They're all coming back
trump, They want to be where the action is
trump, After years of devastating defense cuts we have fully rebuilt the United States military
trump, Thanks to the incredible courage of our warriors, the greatest warriors in the world, the ISIS caliphate has been totally destroyed and its savage founder, and leader, al-Baghdadi is dead
trump, Weeks ago, at my direction, the US military launched a flawless precision strike that killed the world's number one terrorist Qasem Soleimani
trump, Soleimani was responsible for murdering and wounding thousands of Americans, and actively planning new attacks, but we stopped him cold
trump, Yet Washington Democrats, like crazy Bernie Sanders and nervous Nancy Pelosi, they opposed our action to save American lives
trump, They oppose it
trump, They oppose it
trump, You know the roadside bombs that you see hurting our people and lots of other people so badly The legs, the arms, wiped out
trump, No legs, no arms
trump, Soleimani loved that
trump, That was his weapon of choice
trump, We didn't like him
trump, He's not around anymore
trump, Well we are creating jobs and killing terrorists the Congressional Democrats are obsessed with demented hoaxes, crazy witch hunts, and deranged partisan crusades
trump, It's all they know how to do
trump, The do nothing Democrats
trump, They have spent the last three years, and probably even before I came down on that beautiful escalator with our beautiful future first lady, trying to overthrow the last election
trump, We will make sure that they face another crushing defeat in the next election
trump, We are going to have a victory that's even greater than 2016
trump, This November we are going to win back the House, we are going to hold the Senate, and we are going to keep The White House
trump, The American people are disgusted by the Washington Democrat … You see it
trump, You see it
trump, Which is worse, the impeachment hoax or the witch hunts from Russia But we're going to be signing up millions and millions of registered Independents, Democrat voters
trump, Today I had the best polls that I've ever had since being elected
trump, The best we've ever had
trump, Remember I used to go over polls But I only used to talk about them when I was doing well otherwise I wouldn't
trump, We had our best polls
trump, Americans of all political beliefs are sick and tired of the radical rage filled left Socialists
trump, I never saw anything … What's going on in this country … What's going on in this country, really the Democrat party is the Socialist party and maybe worse
trump, Voters are making a mass exodus from that party and we are welcoming them to the Republican party with wide open arms
trump, The Republican party is doing great
trump, We are privileged to be joined tonight by a courageous leader who left the Democrat party because he has had enough of their extremism, enough of their Socialism, and enough of their vile hoaxes and scams
trump, He's had enough
trump, I tell you he really is, he's a brave guy
trump, He just said,  I'm not doing it
trump, I'm not doing it
trump, It's a hoax, it's a scam, I'm not doing it
trump, We called him, You're our kind of guy
trump, Let's go
trump, It didn't take much because he believes like we do
trump, We are truly honored to be here with the newest Republican member of the House of Representatives, your great congressman, Jeff Van Drew
trump, I have to tell you a few weeks ago Jeff was one of the few brave and principled Democrat lawmakers, in all fairness we've been after him for a longtime, who stood up to the House Democrats and the outrageous abusive power that you see going on right now
trump, They can't win an election so they're trying to steal an election
trump, It's not happening folks
trump, It's not happening
trump, Jeff had the guts to defy the left-wing fanatics in his own party, and to stand tall in defense of our constitution, our freedom, and democracy itself
trump, I just want to … I have to tell you, I've gotten to know him really well over the last couple of weeks
trump, He's a great guy, he's a brave guy, he shares our values
trump, He supports lower taxes, not bad
trump, They want to raise your taxes
trump, How did that work Jeff How did you get elected with that one Less regulation, a strong national defense
trump, He loves our military, loves our vets, and police
trump, He is a tireless champion for the state of New Jersey
trump, He loves your second amendment, which is under siege by the Democrats
trump, Jeff, it's an honor to be with you
trump, Please, please
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you man
trump, We have tens of thousands of people outside
trump, If anybody would like to give them your place please let us know, but we have thousands and thousands
trump, Tens of thousands
trump, Jeff gave me a number, he said, 175,000 people signed up
trump, Is that a fact 175 I think he's on his way
trump, I think he's on his way
trump, Thank you Jeff, great job
trump, Thank you Jeff
trump, Thank you Jeff
trump, It's been a little bit of a story
trump, You see the fakers back there Fake news
trump, Fake
trump, You know if another candidate has 1,000 people they say he spoke to a massive crowd
trump, If they have 10,000, like Pocahontas went into Central Park in New York
trump, This young men could have 10,000 people, you know that, in Central Park
trump, She had 10,000 people like in Central Park
trump, I said, What's the big deal They made it, Oh the crowds are so large
trump, Jeff just told you he had 175,000 people sign up
trump, Seriously you have to see outside
trump, They know because they have to follow, they're trailers
trump, I call them trailers
trump, But they're fake
trump, They're fake
trump, They're not honest
trump, Let me just tell you, so here's the story, so we have these massive crowds that fill up stadiums every single time
trump, We have tens of thousands of people outside
trump, They never mention it
trump, They never mention it, so maybe they will tonight
trump, But that's an all-time record
trump, This is not a brand new place and unfortunately it holds 10,000 people or less
trump, We set the all-time record
trump, You know why Because for games … See the floor packed with people For games you're playing ice hockey or basketball, so we broke the all-time record in this house
trump, It's a wonderful house in a wonderful community
trump, Also in Wildwood, like we're in the middle of winter
trump, There is nobody in the middle of winter and it's a great place in the summer
trump, Those streets are packed all the way back to the airplane practically
trump, But on June 2nd everybody has to do us all a favor
trump, Number one you have to get out and vote Republican
trump, Get rid of these clowns
trump, You have to get out and vote for really a brave man
trump, What he did was incredible
trump, Jeff Van Drew, what he did was incredible
trump, Get out and vote
trump, He's going to have a big victory
trump, He's going to have a big victory
trump, We're grateful to have with us this evening some wonderful friends of mine, people that I've known forever, your former governor who did a terrific job, Chris Christie
trump, Chris
trump, Great Chris, great job
trump, Your wonderful Republican State Chairman Doug Steinhardt, what a job he's doing
trump, Thank you Doug
trump, Thank you Doug
trump, My campaign's two great New Jersey co-chairs and I think we'll play for the state … You know they all say Republicans can't win
trump, Tell me why They said, Should you move this to the Meadowlands I said, No, I want to be in South Jersey
trump, We want to be with our friends
trump, But we could have filled up the Meadowlands arena two or three times
trump, Maybe we'll do it during the summer
trump, Should we do it during the summer Maybe
trump, But two brave guys, two great politicians
trump, People that love our state
trump, State senators Mike Testa and Joe Pennacchio
trump, Joe Pennacchio
trump, Thank you Joe
trump, Thank you
trump, Thank you
trump, Two incredible New Jersey natives, you've never heard of Kellyanne Conway have you say something
trump, Thank you Kellyanne
trump, I just want to thank Republicans because what they've been doing is incredible
trump, Republican leadership in this country we're winning, winning, winning like never before
trump, We're winning again and we've got a party that's a very different part, a much stronger party, a much more inclusive party
trump, We have a party that we love
trump, We have a party that has the votes
trump, We have a party like they've never had before
trump, The Republican party respected again
trump, I have to say this, America is winning again and America is thriving again like never before
trump, Since the election we have created seven million new jobs
trump, The average unemployment rate under my administration is lower than any previous administration, listen to this one, in United States history
trump, That's a good fact, the lowest in history
trump, Thank you man
trump, We have a great veteran up here and he said, We love you
trump, We love you
trump, The veterans
trump, Are we doing good for the veterans Thank you
trump, African American, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment rates have reached the lowest levels ever recorded in the history of our country
trump, Ever recorded Women's unemployment is at a 65 year low
trump, Sorry about that
trump, Soon it's going to be historic
trump, Another couple of good months it'll be historic
trump, 65 years for women
trump, In the eight years before I took office over 300,000 working age people left the workforce
trump, They had no choice
trump, In just three years of my administration 3
trump,5 million people have joined the workforce
trump, Nobody believes it, including the fake … The workforce
trump, Nobody believes it including the fake news
trump, If I would have said that during the campaign that we were going to produce numbers like this, the fakeness would have been hitting me
trump, He's exaggerating
trump, He's lying, Pinocchio, Pinocchio
trump, The press is very dishonest
trump, More than two million millennials have gotten jobs and their wages have grown by nearly 5 every year, which is a record
trump, A record number of Americans between the ages of 25 and 34 are now working, another record
trump, Under the Trump economy, the lowest paid earners are reaping the fastest gains of anybody
trump, You don't hear that because this is a blue collar boom
trump, It's very nice
trump, It's about time
trump, It's about time
trump, It's been many, many decades
trump, Earnings for the bottom 10 are rising faster than earnings for the top 10, first time ever
trump, Since my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased, listen to this, by 47, three times faster than the increase for the top 1
trump, Median household income is at an all time high
trump, For President Bush, in eight years it was 450, over eight years
trump, Think of this for a second
trump, Under President Barack Hussein Obama, for eight years it was 975, so eight years, eight years, 450, 975 under your favorite President, and when you include the tax cuts, the regulation cuts that nobody's ever cut taxes like this
trump, Nobody's ever cut regulations
trump, That's why all these jobs are being built
trump, Under President Trump, for three years, the number is almost 10,000, and that's three years, and it's going up
trump, It's going up very substantial
trump, That's a big difference
trump, New business applications in New Jersey have just soared to a record high, and we have lifted 10 million people nationwide off federal welfare
trump, They're off
trump, They are off federal welfare
trump, Nobody would've believed these numbers
trump, Someday they're going to write the true story
trump, Our child tax credit alone is delivering 2,200 a year to 40 million American families
trump, We have ended, so importantly for you, the war on American energy
trump, The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world
trump, We don't need anybody else's energy anymore
trump, It's so nice
trump, What happened in the last three years with energy is incredible, but extreme liberals in Washington want to shut down U
trump,S
trump, energy, including through the so-called Green New Deal
trump, Close your factories
trump, Get rid of your cows
trump, You don't have too many cows in Wildwood, but if you do, they're gone
trump, We will never sacrifice America's energy independence
trump, Took us a long time to get there, and we really picked it up over the last three years
trump, What we've done is incredible, pipelines all over
trump, Pipelines are good
trump, They're underground, they're good, environmentally sound
trump, To lift up forgotten communities that need investment the most
trump, These are the communities that really have suffered
trump, We created, with the help of a great gentleman from the state of South Carolina, You know who I'm talking about Tim Scott, right Senator Tim Scott, he's an incredible guy
trump, He really is
trump, He came to my office and he had this idea that he's wanted to do for a long time
trump, Senator Tim Scott, opportunity zones, and jobs and investment are now pouring into nearly 170 newly designated opportunity zones right here in New Jersey, all over the United States
trump, Billions, and billions, and billions of dollars, and not government dollars, they're flowing into the opportunities zones into areas where investment was dead
trump, For decades, politicians ran for office promising to protect American workers, but then they went to Washington and they lined their pockets with special address cash, and they shipped American jobs and dreams to other countries
trump, They closed up your factories
trump, They got rid of your jobs
trump, They didn't have to pay taxes
trump, Globalist politicians lowered our economic defenses and allowed other nations to rob our factories, steal our farms and ransack our communities
trump, Not anymore, not anymore, because we are defenseless no more because long last you have a President who puts America first
trump, Is that okay The United States laws, listen to this number, and you know if it was wrong, the fake news would be all over me, and I've been saying it for three years
trump, The United States lost 60,000 factories and plants
trump, Think of that
trump, You wouldn't think that's possible because of stupid trade deals, because of bad leadership
trump, During the 16 years of the two prior administrations, under just three years, my administration has now added 12,000 new factories, and many more are being built and they're pouring back into the United States, because that's where the action is
trump, That's where they want to be
trump, They are pouring back into our country, new plants and factories
trump, You see them all over
trump, I passed two of them coming in, brand new, beautiful plants and factories
trump, They're pouring back in
trump, This is where the action is
trump, This is where they want to be
trump, I see the leaders, they say, It's incredible what happened to your country
trump, I said, Don't tell me that
trump, We want you to have your companies build plants in New Jersey and other places, and that's what's happening
trump, But on no issue have Washington Democrats thoroughly betrayed the American people than the issue of immigration
trump, Left-wing, radical, politician support deadly sanctuary cities, and remember, a sanctuary city is a jurisdiction that refuses to hand over criminal aliens that are in local law enforcement custody
trump, Instead, they order them to be released into your community
trump, What the hell is going on What is going on Once set loose, these criminal aliens are free to continue their crimes spree against innocent Americans
trump, Right here in New Jersey, your state's Democrat leaders have instituted sanctuary policies that result in dangerous predators being set free into your community
trump, For example, Cumberland County, we all know Cumberland County very well, right Good luck with this one
trump, They released an illegal alien criminal with multiple charges for sexual assault of a child
trump, He is now at large, free to search for another innocent victim
trump, They didn't want to give him to ICE, and I want to thank ICE, because the abuse they take and the incredible job they do
trump, Right here, another criminal alien was arrested for a violent assault in New Jersey
trump, The sanctuary jurisdiction of Middlesex County defied the ICE request to detain him
trump, Local authorities released him and he went on to commit a gruesome triple murder
trump, I could read these cases, honestly, I could read and state these cases to you all night
trump, I could state these cases to you all night
trump, No American should ever be hurt, harmed or killed because left-wing politicians, Democrats, decided to shield and shelter… Look, look, wait
trump, You have criminals that are on the streets that should be in jail
trump, You have criminals that on the street that should be taken the hell out of our country and brought back to where they came from
trump, By the way, ICE has removed thousands upon thousands of MS-13 gang members, the most brutal people
trump, You don't want to do that job
trump, Maybe you do, a couple of tough people up there
trump, Anybody want to be with ICE You got a lot of tough people in New Jersey
trump, New Jersey is different
trump, I think New Jersey is different
trump, No, but these ICE people, they love our country
trump, They're proud and they're tough people, and they'll go right into a pack
trump, They call it a pack and they start swinging
trump, Everyone's swinging or they end up standing up
trump, That's the end of that, and you know what they do They bring the MS-13 and many other gang members and other members back to El Salvador, back to Honduras, back to Guatemala, back to Mexico
trump, I want to thank Mexico because you know what's happening, right Thousands and thousands at this moment, 27,000 soldiers from Mexico, protecting our Southern border
trump, I want to thank the President
trump, Democrats stand for crime, corruption and chaos
trump, Republicans stand for law, order and justice, and say what you want, but those are the facts
trump, We are removing these illegal criminals and gang members
trump, We are literally taking them by so many, thousands and thousands, and we're bringing him back
trump, Thanks to our tireless efforts of border patrol to secure our border, we have reduced illegal border crossings seven straight months in a row
trump, We have the numbers down by 75 since spring, 75
trump, We have ended catch and release and really, look, I had another party
trump, I could get anything
trump, If I wanted to spend money on anything, look with the military, we got two trillion dollars, right More
trump, Two trillion, all made in America, right Everything
trump, Best planes, best missiles, best everything, made in America
trump, If I wanted to build anything, the only thing they put the whole weight of their party, they didn't want us to have the wall
trump, They knew it worked
trump, Many of them voted five years ago for a wall
trump, They just didn't know how to get it built
trump, I do
trump, But what happened is through a series of court cases and other things, the money has won, and we are now building that beautiful wall, and this powerful border wall is going up at record speed and we just reached over 100 miles of wall, and by next year, we'll be over 400 miles, and shortly thereafter it will be complete
trump, A lot of people were saying a year ago, He didn't build the wall yet
trump, He didn't build the wall
trump, Let me tell you
trump, When you have the strength of a party that has the House, okay, hopefully they're not going to have the House for long
trump, We'll have a wonderful new speaker, will get rid of Nancy Pelosi, nervous Nancy, nervous Nancy
trump, We'll have Kevin McCarthy who's been fantastic
trump, We have to win back the House
trump, But think of this
trump, The wall, so many people were saying, Build it
trump, Well, it's not easy when you have the weight of an entire party and they control the House, not easy
trump, We did it and frankly we were building the wall through the help of the military, the Army Corps of Engineers anyway, but you know what Now we actually have the money and it's going up very rapidly
trump, In all due respect to Mexico, we like Mexico very much, and we've gotten along great with Mexico, and the President's a friend of mine, and I think he's doing a fantastic job
trump, It's a tough situation
trump, But Mexico is in fact, you will soon find out, paying for the wall
trump, Okay They'd hit you with that
trump, Now the wall is ultimately and very nicely being paid for by Mexico, and it's an advantage for Mexico, too, when you think about it
trump, The wall is a vital barrier for blocking deadly drugs from pouring into these communities
trump, What we're doing is stopping drugs at a record number
trump, It's still anything that comes over is too much, but we're blocking it at a record number
trump, I'm also very proud to report that we won a critical Supreme Court victory yesterday on immigration
trump, We will now be finally able to enforce federal law, and ensure that those seeking admission to our country are able to support themselves financially and not abuse taxpayer funded programs
trump, They were killing our country, killing our country
trump, Washington Democrats have never been more extreme than they are right now
trump, Frankly, they're crazy
trump, These people are crazy
trump, They're taking their cues from socialists like Bernie
trump, Left-wing lawmakers are pushing a government takeover of health care that would strip 180 million Americans of their private health care plans, which many people like
trump, The plans of every Democrat running for President would demolish the economy of New Jersey, where half a million new New Jersey workers are employed at some of the best and most innovative health care employment companies
trump, We have them working at the companies, and we have people getting great health care
trump, It's been so long
trump, It's finally working and they want to destroy it
trump, The Republican party will never let it happen
trump, We are saving your health care while the Democrats are trying to take away your health care, take away your doctors, take away all of the good care that we fought, and we fought hard, and we're doing well and now we're doing better
trump, By the way, some time prior to the end of the year, we're putting in for a new middle income tax cut, a very big one
trump, But we're making health care better and much, much cheaper
trump, We've done a great job in running it and we've given you a lot of alternatives
trump, We are protecting people with pre-existing conditions and we always will, the Republican party, pre-existing conditions, we saved it
trump, We are stopping surprise medical billing and making everything transparent
trump, That's a big deal, and that will take effect starting in about two months from now
trump, Everything's transparent
trump, You'll be able to see pricing
trump, You'll be able to go and price other hospitals, other doctors
trump, It's going to be an incredible thing
trump, Nobody believes I was able to do it, but we did it
trump, We are defending your right to keep the doctor and the plan of your choice
trump, We are lowering drug prices
trump, The Democrats are increasing drug prices
trump, We are fighting the lobbyists and special interests
trump, We are serving you and how are we doing We're doing good, right But because of price transparency, we are getting it done
trump, We're approving more generic drugs than ever before in the history of our country
trump, That means they come in, frankly, they're just as good as the big names, but they sell for 80 less in some cases
trump, We are unleashing innovation to cure diseases of all kinds
trump, We are cutting out the rich middlemen and delivering prescription drugs directly to the consumers
trump, These are all things that we had to fight like hell to get
trump, We're making less paperwork for your doctors and giving you easy control of your medical records, which is a big deal for a lot of people
trump, We are prohibiting hospitals from hiding their prices and charging hidden costs
trump, You go home, you say, Oh, I'm feeling better
trump, The doctor was fantastic, and then they send you a bill for 25,000
trump, That's the end of that
trump, All of a sudden the doctor wasn't so good, right We are making companies compete for your business
trump, We are repealing burdensome taxes
trump, We have accomplished more than any President in the first three years of their term by far, not even close
trump, We have provided health insurance options, 60 cheaper than Obamacare, and we have historic investments in treating kidney disease, HIV, pediatric cancer and Alzheimer's disease
trump, We're making so much progress
trump, We have just passed a thing that I think is great
trump, I never understood
trump, For 45 years, they've been trying to get it passed
trump, We've just passed a thing called Right to Try
trump, You know what that is So, we have the greatest doctors, the greatest technicians, the greatest labs in the world, and we'll have a drug that's looking good, but it's going to take five more years, and by the way, we've brought the timing way down from 12 years to half of that, but it takes years to get it approved
trump, You have people that are terminally ill
trump, If they have money, they go to Asia, they go to Europe, they go all over the world looking for help
trump, If they don't have money, they go home and they die
trump, What we did is a thing called Right to Try
trump, People sign something and they don't hold the country responsible
trump, They don't hold the drug company responsible
trump, It's called Right to Try, and they get the newest, and the best, and the latest medicine where it's looking good, but you're not going to have it for five more years, and you know why they didn't do it Because they didn't want to hurt anybody, except the problem is the people were going to die soon
trump, I said, They're terminally ill
trump, Let them have it
trump, We sat down with a great group of leaders, Republican leaders, and honestly, we had some bipartisan support and we got it done
trump, They've been tried to do it for 45 or so years
trump, We got it done
trump, You have to see the results, and I've seen some of the results
trump, Some of the results are incredible
trump, We've transformed veteran's health care, including through VA choice, right VA choice
trump, For 48 years they've been trying to get veterans choice
trump, I thought I had the greatest secret
trump, You know, I haven't been doing this that long, so four years ago, I'm campaigning for president
trump, Everyone said, No, he's only having fun
trump, Yeah, it's some fun
trump, This is a lot of fun
trump, Right But for 45 years- But for 45 years they've been trying to get it Veteran's Choice
trump, So I come back one day, I say to my people, I have the greatest idea
trump, I am so smart
trump, I am like the smart- I have an idea because the veterans are waiting online
trump, They're waiting online for two weeks, three weeks, four weeks, ten weeks
trump, Some are okay and they end up being terminally ill by the time they see the doctors, too long
trump, And I said, Folks, I have the greatest idea
trump, All of my people, I say, I have the greatest idea
trump, I'm so smart
trump, Here's what we're going to do
trump, We're going to send all those people that can't see a doctor, we just can't get them to see a doctor
trump, We're going to send them down the road to private doctors and we're going to pay the bill and they're going to get fixed up
trump, Right So smart
trump, But you see, I said I was smart and they looked back at me and they said, Sir, we've known about that concept for 45 years
trump, We just can't get it approved
trump, But I got it approved
trump, And I got it approved about 11 months ago
trump, And the VA is doing fantastically well
trump, Our veterans are doing great
trump, That was a big thing
trump, That was a big thing
trump, We also got accountability
trump, Where people could mistreat our veterans, do whatever they want, they could be sadistic
trump, They could be so many other things
trump, They could steal, they could rob
trump, You couldn't do anything, you'd keep them
trump, You couldn't do a thing
trump, We got accountability
trump, Now you look at him, you say, Get the hell out of here
trump, You're fired, you're fired
trump, Now you can fire
trump, They've let go of more than 8,000 bad people
trump, We have reduced opioid deaths for the first time, and very substantially, in 30 years
trump, And we are modernizing critical vaccines
trump, We're doing a great job with vaccines
trump, We are creating a pathway to buy drugs from Canada, that are much, much cheaper, in Florida
trump, Governor Ron DeSantis came to me
trump, He said, Sir, this system is so bad
trump, And you can't fix it unless you have democrat votes, that's why you got to vote the house
trump, You got to get us back the house
trump, They say, Sir, we can buy the drugs in Canada for 50 less
trump, The same drug made in the same factory, made by the same company
trump, 50 and we can give the benefit for the people that live in Florida, or Colorado, or New Jersey, or wherever you are
trump, This has been going on for a long time
trump, No president has wanted to do it
trump, You know how long it took me to make that decision I said, If you can say 50, or 25, or 15 buy it
trump, Do it
trump, Go
trump, And I gave him authorization, Do it
trump, We are protecting Medicare for our nation's seniors
trump, Democrats want, and you know this, Democrats want to raid Medicare to fund benefits for illegal immigrants
trump, And you know, we all have a heart
trump, We all have a heart, but when you tell people to come into our country, like this clown governor of California, come into our country
trump, They're all going to come
trump, If they think they're going to get free education, free healthcare, they're all going to come
trump, If you don't say it, they're not going to come
trump, Because who would even think this Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion
trump, Ripping babies straight from the mother's womb, right up until the moment of birth
trump, And that is why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God
trump, Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption
trump, Look at what's happening to their cities
trump, Los Angeles, it's so sad
trump, What you see is so sad with the homeless and the way they don't take care of the homeless
trump, San Francisco, starting in New York
trump, You could take a look at what's happening to our cities run by Democrats
trump, It's a disaster
trump, They don't know what the hell they're doing
trump, The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, and the American dream
trump, Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background and from every race, religion, color, and creed
trump, We are asking all Americans to join our incredible movement
trump, That's what it is
trump, It's one of the greatest moments
trump, It's probably the greatest movement in history
trump, The 2016 election was probably, I mean you could say, the greatest election in the history of our country
trump, And now we have to do it again to keep it going
trump, It's like a giant tree, you plant it, but it takes time to grab on
trump, We need this next election so badly
trump, The good news is, it's much easier, because here I've done it all
trump, I've achieved more than I promised
trump, I never told you about Space Force
trump, We got Space Force
trump, I never told you about all of these things that we got
trump, We are a big tent party in the true idea
trump, It's big ideas, and we have a big future together
trump, This country has tremendous potential, if we don't blow it
trump, To give former prisoners a second chance at life, we pass bi-partisan, criminal justice reform
trump, They came to me, they couldn't get it done, including many conservatives
trump, And these people that I fight every day, they came to me, Help, help, help
trump, Criminal justice reform
trump, I got it done
trump, As soon as I got it done, they don't even want to mention my name
trump, I got it done
trump, I got people to vote for it that they could have never gotten
trump, President Obama tried, he couldn't get it done
trump, President Bush couldn't get it
trump, They couldn't get it done
trump, That's okay
trump, They couldn't get it done
trump, I got it done
trump, I got it done
trump, And after I got it done, and I mean solely got it done, and after I got it done they had news conferences
trump, They're thanking people that I never even heard of
trump, The only one they didn't think was President Trump
trump, And I got it done, but that's the way it is
trump, That's why I always say you have to thank yourself because nobody else is going to do it
trump, We're fighting to give school choice to every child in America who needs it
trump, During National School Choice Week, we reaffirmed that no parent should be forced to send their child to a failing government school
trump, School Choice, very important
trump, Democrats don't want that
trump, To uphold the rule of law, we have confirmed 191 brand new beautiful federal judges who will interpret the Constitution as written
trump, And two great Supreme court justices, two great ones
trump, As we rebuild our military, we have authorized over 160 million to support our warriors at a place called, huh, McGuire Air Force Base and Fort Dix
trump, Have you ever heard of those places Have you ever heard of those places, New Jersey  160 million, two great places
trump, I recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem
trump, And we recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights
trump, Nobody else was going to do it
trump, They've been trying to do that one for 52 years
trump, For years you watched as your politicians apologized for America
trump, Now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the people of New Jersey
trump, My friends
trump, At stake in our present battle is the survival of our nation
trump, I really mean that, it's the survival of our nation
trump, And if you would have had the other party winning this last election, instead of your market being up 72
trump, Instead of your 401ks being up numbers that you can't even believe where your wife or your husband says, Darling, you're the most brilliant person in history
trump, For years, you've been losing your ass with 401ks
trump, Now you're making a fortune
trump, Right Right Now you're making a fortune
trump, I have people coming up to me all the time
trump, I had one gentlemen come up, Sir
trump, Thank you, sir
trump, You've made me look so smart
trump, My wife never respected me for anything, not anything
trump, But now she thinks I'm a great investor
trump, Thank you
trump, 401k
trump, If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for it to secure, then we must devote everything that we have toward victory in 2020
trump, We have to
trump, And by the way, when we talk about inheriting victory in 2020 in our Nation, just so you understand, under a big tax cut biggest tax cut plan in history, guess what you have You have a business, you have a farm, you have a small business, no more inheritance tax, no more what we call death tax
trump, So if you love your children, they won't have to mortgage the plant
trump, They won't have to be mortgage the farm, as the expression goes
trump, They won't have to mortgage anything, there's no tax
trump, If you don't love your children, don't leave it to them and then you do have a problem
trump, No, I'm only kidding
trump, Does anybody here not love their child or their children Because if you don't… There's one man raising his hand
trump, Nah, that's a big thing
trump, No more estate tax, no more death tax for your small farms and business
trump, Those are things that people don't even realize
trump, Only this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp once and for all
trump, And I never even knew the swamp was this bad
trump, Swamp is bad, bad people
trump, A lot of bad people in the swamp
trump, Bad people in the swamp you thought this was going to be easy, right A lot of bad people
trump, Together, we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration
trump, That's what's happening now
trump, We will enact trade deals, the greatest deals ever made
trump, That result in more product proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase Made in the USA
trump, Beautiful
trump, For decades we had politicians that didn't care about that phrase
trump, That phrase didn't mean anything to them
trump, We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine
trump, Finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic, can you believe this, in America in 10 years or less
trump, We've already started the process
trump, And it could have been started sooner by the past administration, they chose not to do it
trump, I chose to do it
trump, Think of that, ending the AIDS epidemic within 10 years that we've started
trump, We will defend privacy, free speech, religious Liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms, which is under seige
trump, By the way, our second amendment is under siege
trump, In Virginia, they want to take your guns away
trump, It's just the beginning
trump, Never going to happen as long as I'm President of the United States
trump, That I can tell you
trump, But above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America

trump, We believe that faith and family, not government bureaucracy, are the true American ways
trump, And we believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag
trump, And we will always live by the words of our national motto, In God, We Trust
trump, Thank you, everybody

trump, And my friends, so many people in this group, I know them well
trump, They're tough
trump, They're smart, they're great people
trump, It's called Jersey

trump, And gave the world American greats like Thomas Edison and Frank Sinatra, old blue eyes
trump, Frank Sinatra
trump, He was a piece of work, that I can tell you
trump, New Jersey is the state where George Washington led a die hard band of American patriots to victory at Trenton, and Princeton, and Monmouth
trump, In our glorious battle to win American independence, George Washington
trump, This is the state where generations of tough and strong New Jersey craftsmen and dock hands, farmers and factory workers built this country into the single greatest nation on the face of the earth
trump, And we are making it greater and greater every day
trump, It will never be better than what's coming
trump, There'll never be anything like what we're doing

trump, And I'm thrilled to be in Winston Salem with thousands of loyal, hard working American Patriots
trump, You are great people
trump, Great people
trump, I don't know how many people here, but there's a lot
trump, We said let's keep it down
trump, They didn't do too good a job, but that's good
trump, That's good
trump, Now these crowds, I tell you it's beyond what we had in terms of enthusiasm, beyond what we had four years ago in 2016, and that was a record enthusiasm and we are breaking that record by a lot
trump, This is the most important election we've ever had
trump, 56 days from now, we're going to win North Carolina
trump, We're going to win four more years in the White House
trump, This is a choice
trump, And I must say, this is a choice for many, many decades
trump, I don't think you has a bigger difference and maybe you've never had a bigger difference
trump, This is the American dream and the other, I don't want to say it because I'll get myself in trouble with the fake news back there
trump, But the other is a basic disaster for our country
trump, Joe Biden devoted his career to offshoring your jobs, throwing open your borders, dragging us into endless foreign wars, along with some of his other friends and surrendering our children's future to countries like China
trump, Remember this, very simple to remember
trump, If Biden wins, China wins
trump, It's as simple as that
trump, So you have a situation where we built the greatest economy in the history of the world
trump, We were forced to close it because of the China plague that came in and now we've opened it
trump, And by the way, your state should be open
trump, Your state should be open
trump, Any governor that does that
trump, And even if you look statistically, it's you it's Michigan, it's a couple of others
trump, They're closed
trump, New York
trump, Look what they're doing in New York, what they're doing to our beautiful New York
trump, It's so sad
trump, But you just take a look at what's going on in North Carolina
trump, They want to open
trump, They want to open
trump, They want to open in Michigan so badly
trump, They want to open
trump, They want to have football
trump, They want to have their schools open
trump, And it's a shame what's going on
trump, And I'll tell you what, on November 4th, every one of those states will be open
trump, They're doing it for political reasons
trump, They're doing it for political reasons
trump, They think by hurting the economy, by keeping all these store owners and all these people that work in shops and stores and buildings, offices, they think by keeping them and hurting them, you're hurting the economy
trump, Our economy is doing phenomenally well
trump, And it's not only is it a V, it's a super V
trump, You see what's happened
trump, We just had a jobs number come out, 1
trump,4 million
trump, It's down to 8
trump,4
trump, Nobody thought that, 8
trump,4
trump, So we had the greatest economy, we closed it up and now we're opening it up and your state should go with it
trump, We're opening it up
trump, And we will have a great third quarter
trump, It's going to be announced, by the way, just before the election, but we're going to have a great third quarter
trump, We have unbelievable retail numbers, unbelievable numbers all over
trump, And this is that super V
trump, But next year is going to be one of the greatest years in the history of a country economically, unless the wrong person gets in and quadruples everybody's taxes in which case you will see a depression the likes of which you haven't seen
trump, And remember this, if Biden wins the violent mobs, you see these mobs all over the place
trump, They're Biden people
trump, They're Biden states and cities
trump, They're Democrat states
trump, If they win, the mobs win
trump, You see these guys, they go around saying, yeah, I want your meal
trump, Give me that food
trump, Give me that
trump, A woman sitting there, she wants to eat
trump, And they come and they grab her food
trump, They grab her drink
trump, Nobody's ever seen stuff like this
trump, This is all that ideology
trump, We're not going to let it happen
trump, We're not going to let it happen
trump, And in Portland, you see what happened last night, they arrested over 50 people the first time
trump, We said, either do it or what going in
trump, We're going to have to go in, do it
trump, Let us go in
trump, We're saying I spoke to the governor of Oregon the other day
trump, Let us go in
trump, I said, let us go in
trump, We'll straighten it out in less than a half an hour
trump, Now the US Marshals did go in to take care of that one guy who killed somebody
trump, You saw that
trump, He killed a young man in the middle of the street violently
trump, He had other charges against him
trump, And I put out, when is he going to be arrested And they went in about 15 minutes later
trump, And I'll tell you what our federal government is so ready to go
trump, All they have to do is call us
trump, It'll all be solved very quickly
trump, They have to call them
trump, But all of these places are Democrat run places, radical left run places
trump, They don't know what the hell they're doing
trump, If Biden wins, the rioters, arsonists and anarchists win
trump, He said the other day, well, if I win, that doesn't mean that's going to stop
trump, He doesn't, he will never stop
trump, If they win, it's not going to happen, hopefully
trump, Because this is not like a second place crowd
trump, Let's face it
trump, Are you seeing Are you seeing all the polls numbers are coming out That's why he left
trump, Finally, he left his basement
trump, He said we got problems
trump, I don't think he knows that, but the people that manage him know it
trump, They understand it
trump, He doesn't
trump, So I'm running for reelection to keep jobs at home, to put violent criminals behind bars and to ensure the future belongs to America, not to China and other countries
trump, Because if we win, America wins
trump, You know that
trump, You've seen that
trump, Over the last three and a half years, we've secured America's borders, fixed our broken trade deals, and they were broken like you've never seen
trump, They weren't even broken
trump, They were bad
trump, They were bad from day one
trump, Rebuilt the awesome power of the United States military, obliterated the ISIS caliphate 100
trump, In fact, I got it down to 98
trump, Remember a year and a half ago, I got it down to 98
trump, And they all said, no, no, it's got to be a 100
trump, I said, somebody else could finish
trump, We want to get home
trump, They said, no, you've got to finish it, so we took another two months, we finished it and we're bringing them home
trump, We're bringing them home
trump, These great, great warriors
trump, People don't like it when I say that
trump, Secured American energy independence and built the greatest economy in the history of the world
trump, And now we are very simply, we're doing it again and we're on track to have, as I said, the best year we've ever had next year
trump, You just had the best year
trump, You just had the best year of the history of your state last year
trump, We've created a record breaking 10
trump,6 million jobs in the last four months
trump, But if sleepy Joe Biden takes power, the economy will collapse
trump, He won't even know the difference
trump, How's the economy Not good, sir
trump, We're in a depression
trump, We are What's that Joe Biden, who spent 47 years shipping North Carolina jobs to China and other countries, you know that
trump, And I've spent the last four years bringing jobs back to our country
trump, We've never had so many jobs
trump, We're up to 160 million jobs
trump, We were never anywhere close
trump, We got up to 160 million and we were never anywhere close to that
trump, Here in North Carolina, voting is already underway
trump, On November 3rd, Americans will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity or whether we allow the same left wing extremists that have no idea what they're doing to burn down buildings or take control of government, set fire to a whole country
trump, You know, when they started knocking down the monuments and statues a few months ago, I signed a very strong executive order
trump, You want to knock them down That's fine
trump, But you go to jail for 10 years
trump, It was amazing
trump, It was amazing how that stopped
trump, And then they said, well, we'll do it easily
trump, We'll do it through the process because they don't want to spend 10 years
trump, You know, they'd look at it
trump, They'd say not worth it
trump, 10 years is too much
trump, But the DC committee, did you see about that They want to change the name of the Washington Monument
trump, They want to get rid of the Lincoln Monument, Jefferson Monument
trump, Now, we're talking the big stuff
trump, They finally hit the big time, took them awhile to get there
trump, But I said that was going to happen
trump, Don't worry about it
trump, You don't have a thing to worry about
trump, If our foreign adversaries were devising a scheme to cripple America, they could hardly do better than the Biden, Kamala Harris, Kamala
trump, Remember Kamala She started at 15
trump, She was supposed to win
trump, Problem was she went from 15 to 14 to 12 to 10 to seven to four
trump, It's like a free fall
trump, You know what, people don't like her
trump, Nobody likes her
trump, She could never be the first woman president
trump, She could never be
trump, That would be an insult to our country
trump, Biden wants to impose a 4 trillion tax hike, a ban on American energy, eliminate America's borders, confiscate your guns
trump, He wants to get rid of your second amendment
trump, We're going to be appointing very pro crime judges, but they want to destroy your suburbs
trump, You know, the rule, the regulation that I just terminated
trump, They want to build low income projects in the suburbs
trump, They've been doing it
trump, They've been destroying suburbs
trump, We're not doing it anymore
trump, Somebody said suburban women, how's Trump doing But do you remember last time too They said women don't like Trump
trump, I said, I think they do
trump, I think they do
trump, They said women don't, and then we did great with women
trump, And remember that great
trump, Was that one of the greatest evenings ever Four years ago
trump, That was one of the greatest
trump, But one of the things they did, first of all, we did much better
trump, Now we're doing really well
trump, African American vote, much better Hispanic vote, much better
trump, He did better with African Americans than we thought
trump, He did better with Hispanic than we thought
trump, He did better with Asians than we thought
trump, He did really well with women
trump, What's this all about Ladies and gentlemen
trump, And they said, Donald Trump is projected the winner of 2016
trump, You remember that evening Was that the craziest That was the craziest thing
trump, And they thought, I think they didn't think it, but I'll tell you what anything we had then, we have much more now
trump, They don't understand
trump, They do understand it
trump, They do
trump, Right They understand it
trump, Look at that beautiful dress
trump, And she wears that dress right through the middle of Hollywood and everyone says, thank you very much
trump, Beautiful
trump, Like it
trump, But they want to indoctrinate your children and implement a ruin or shutdown of the United States economy again
trump, Biden said the other day, well, if the experts told me
trump, We're not shutting it down again
trump, We don't have to
trump, We learned about the disease
trump, We did the right thing
trump, We saved millions of lives
trump, People don't realize we saved millions of lives and hundreds of thousands of lives by not letting China
trump, We put a ban on China, heavily infected
trump, And Biden was against it
trump, Three months later, he said he did the right thing, I have to admit
trump, It's clear why both China and the flag burning rioters want Biden to win
trump, They know his policies will be the downfall of America and they know my policies will lift America to new heights of national greatness like we've never seen before
trump, That's what's happening
trump, That's what's happening
trump, And never forget, they're coming after me because I'm fighting for you
trump, There's a lot of truth in that one
trump, And they do come after me
trump, They do come after me
trump, They have more things to say about me
trump, Every day, it's something
trump, They said, you see the plane where it is Sir, would you like to take the car I say, why I'm saying what Well, I heard you had a limp
trump, I do I don't know about a limp
trump, I don't have a limp
trump, Hey, someday, I'm going to have a limp
trump, I'll let you know when
trump, You'll see it
trump, No, they make this stuff up
trump, They make it up
trump, They make stuff
trump, It's called disinformation
trump, They give a phony deal out
trump, They did it two days ago with the military
trump, There's nobody that loves the military more than me
trump, I was very lucky though
trump, I had 15 incredible American Patriots that came by and they said, he never said that
trump, They were there
trump, They were there
trump, But they make up stories, horrible stories, many, many
trump, Hey, look, look at last time, the fake dirty dossier
trump, It was all made up
trump, And frankly, if the shoe was on the other foot, if it was on the other foot, you'd have many people, 20, 25 people right now in jail for two years and they'd be there for 50 years because they got caught spying on our campaign and it's treason or whatever else you want to call it
trump, And it's a disgrace that it's taken this long
trump, It's a disgrace that it's taken this long
trump, And let me just tell you a little secret
trump, Obama got caught and so did sleepy Joe Biden
trump, Remember Biden just sitting in the room saying, why don't you use the Logan Act on General Flynn Look at General Flynn, what he's going through for years
trump, If that were ever reversed, I'm telling you, you'd have many people in jail for many, many years and it would have started three years ago
trump, It's a disgrace, but let's see what happens
trump, Biden's a globalist sellout who spent his career laying waste to American communities
trump, And you know, he talks about like, well, he's going to do this
trump, He's going to … He doesn't have any idea
trump, He has no clue
trump, He's going to do this
trump, He's been there for 47 years
trump, And he just really left
trump, He left three and a half, four years ago
trump, So he just left, but he's been there for 47 years
trump, I'm going to do this
trump, After 47 years, he's had a change of heart
trump, This is the craziest election
trump, This is the craziest … Look, somebody said, what's the difference between crooked Hillary Clinton and slow Joe So the difference is the following
trump, She's meaner, probably not as nice
trump, I don't know
trump, You can't get any worse than her, when you think
trump, But the big difference is she's smarter than he is
trump, Okay
trump, He's a nicer person, but he's not smart
trump, He never was, not in prime time and certainly not now
trump, The Washington vultures ripped apart our towns in exchange for his party's nomination
trump, Biden has now formed an unholy alliance with the most extreme and dangerous elements of the radical left, you know that, with crazy Bernie and everyone
trump, And by the way, you know who's further left than crazy Bernie Kamala, Kamala, Kamala
trump, You remember she left the race
trump, Sort of interesting that they picked her because in theory, they should be able to win in California
trump, I don't know
trump, Maybe we'll make a play for that one too
trump, But they picked somebody from California
trump, I don't quite get it, but you always pick somebody that's hot
trump, That's going up in the polls, going up
trump, Frankly, I'm not sure
trump, I don't think I've ever said this, but probably Hillary should have picked Bernie Sanders to be her running mate
trump, Right Because as crazy as it sounds, he was hot
trump, He gave her a hell of a fight
trump, A lot of people think he won and it got taken away
trump, One thing about Bernie, he's the greatest loser I've ever seen because look, any children here No not too many, but they've heard it before
trump, He got screwed four years ago and he got screwed again
trump, Biden got the nomination
trump, He got the nomination
trump, But if Biden would have sat back and if Elizabeth Warren, Pocahontas, you remember Pocahontas She finally faded
trump, She faded badly
trump, But if she would have dropped out on Super Tuesday, prior to Super Tuesday, Bernie would have been the nominee
trump, And I don't know who I'd rather run against
trump, One is super left
trump, The other one's had to become super left
trump, One is competent
trump, The other one is only half competent now and heading south
trump, He's half competent and heading south rapidly
trump, But the globalists and the leftists make natural partners because they're united by their contempt for the American middle class in the truest sense
trump, That's why powerful corporations and far left politicians have both sided with radical demonstrated over
trump, If you look at that, it's over the law abiding areas that we have
trump, Republican cities and towns are doing great
trump, We're doing great
trump, And we don't have crime and we don't have this violence
trump, Chicago over the weekend, many people killed, many people shot, shot
trump, They're actually shot and killed
trump, New York, the same thing
trump, New York's gone through the roof
trump, They were up 300 in certain categories
trump, And you say, what's happening And we want to send them in so badly
trump, Joe Biden and his party spent the entire summer cheering on the rioters rampaging through a Democrat run cities falsely labeling them as peaceful protesters
trump, And you know, we call you peaceful protesters, you know why Because they have rules in these Democrat run states that if you're campaigning, you can't have more than five people
trump, They- That if you're campaigning you can't have more than five people
trump, They did that for me
trump, If you are going to church you can't go to church anymore
trump, You can't go to church
trump, You can't go to church, you can't do anything
trump, You have to stay in your house but if you're willing to riot, running down Main Street, if you're willing to riot and stand on top of each other's face and do whatever the hell you want to do, you're allowed to do that because you're considered a peaceful protester so we decided to call all our rallies peaceful protests even my people, my very brilliant consultants who I don't listen to too much, maybe I should
trump, Sir, please don't say law and order
trump, That's too tough
trump, Now in the meantime you look at these streets, people crazy
trump, They say, Say law and order but with safety
trump, I said, Look, people get it
trump, It's just law and order, is that okay We want law and order
trump, They say, Law and order and safety, sir
trump, Could you add the word safety Because it's … I said, I don't want to add
trump, It's sort of obvious, right We want law, we want order
trump, Biden is fueling the violence with his relentless attacks on police and his constant slander that America is racist
trump, By the way I've gotten the support of almost every police group in the country
trump, Sheriffs in Florida, Ohio, Texas, North Carolina
trump, All over the country, but did you notice he's starting to talk a little bit tougher now, did you notice that He sees what's going on, his polls are dropping like a rock and he sees what's going on
trump, Now he's starting to say, No, we need law and order
trump, No he didn't say that, did he He'll never get to say that, can't say that because then it'd lose the whole left and let me tell you the left is running that party
trump, You take a look at … You don't want to be dealing with the left
trump, These people are stone cold crazy, you don't want to be dealing
trump, Meanwhile Biden, he doesn't say a word about the thousands of African-Americans who are murdered each year as a result of violent crime in Democrat-controlled cities
trump, They're murdered by the thousands and they never, ever mention it
trump, My heart is with the hardworking patriots of all backgrounds who build up our communities, not the violent criminals and extremists and agitators and anarchists who burn them down
trump, Next time you see video of screaming far left maniacs shouting wildly at peaceful Americans, remember this
trump, These are Biden supporters, and if he wins, they will be in charge of your government as sure as you're sitting there
trump, You'll be taking your monuments down
trump, You'll be taking your statues down
trump, I'm not kidding, you'll be taking them down
trump, You have to look at the D
trump,C
trump, report, I'm just telling you, go get it, you wouldn't even believe it
trump, It's too crazy to even talk about, but we're never going to give them a chance to do it
trump, We're never giving them a chance
trump, We're going to win, we're going to win big
trump, This is a very important state, and by the way … By the way, when they send out their millions and millions of unsolicited ballots, when you get a ballot, say, Well I wanted to go and vote, darling
trump, I wanted to go and vote
trump, Why are they sending me those ballots There's something really … The only way we lose North Carolina and a couple of others like Nevada, we're doing great there
trump, Now the governor decides we're doing so well that they're going to send out unsolicited
trump, You have solicited and unsolicited
trump, They're going to send out millions of ballots to you
trump, People that never really thought in terms of it
trump, Now sometimes you'll ask for a ballot
trump, That's a solicited ballot
trump, It's okay, you have to go through a process, you have to sign the form, you get it
trump, Sending out millions of unsolicited ballots
trump, Make sure you send the ballot in and then go to your polling place and make sure it counts
trump, Make sure it counts
trump, Because the only way they can win is by doing very bad things
trump, That's the only way as far as the eye can see, but they'll correct it
trump, They'll say, He's wrong, it was 14,500, he's misrepresenting
trump, He's misrepresenting
trump, Now I was told we have 15,000 and we're in the middle of an airport someplace
trump, It's a wonderful thing
trump, I actually think … I don't know if you agree
trump, So we go to the arenas but because of China, the arenas aren't working out too well, right You can't really do that anymore for a while but we are rounding the turn, I will tell you, we're rounding the turn on that but because of that … So we said where because we have the same crowds
trump, I think we have bigger crowds potentially
trump, We were in New Hampshire the other night, we had to turn away 8,000 people at an airport
trump, We're doing all mostly hangar things because we're outside
trump, Outside is very much different than being inside according to the great doctors, right But they say it's very much different
trump, So we're doing these and we're doing the outdoors, we're doing the hangars, but I really believe that these crowds are bigger than they were four years ago
trump, It's pretty amazing
trump, It's pretty amazing
trump, We started off in New Hampshire, we said, Look, let's have 1,000 people, and they had like five or six show up and they had thousands more
trump, We're trying to be nice but then eventually we landed … Two weeks ago, we landed in New Hampshire and the entire runaway was lit up with thousands and thousands of people as the plane was landing and I mean it's really amazing what's going on
trump, All over the country, it's amazing
trump, It's amazing
trump, It's a great thing
trump, More support than we had four years ago because four years ago I said I was going to do this, I was going to cut your taxes, I was going to cut regulations, I was going to get right to try, I was going to take care of your vets, I was going to rebuild your military, I was going to do all these things and you said, I don't know
trump, That's a lot of … You know what I've actually done more than I promised
trump, Build a wall, build a wall, true
trump, I've done more
trump, For instance you never heard me say, you never heard me say, a lot of you were at various rallies, you never heard me talking about space force
trump, We built, think of it
trump, A new branch of the United States military, the United States Armed Forces called Air Force
trump, I never talked about that
trump, That's something we never talked about
trump, I only figured that one out after I became president because I saw what Russia was doing and what China was doing
trump, I said we have to do the same thing, and if you think that was easy, that was not easy
trump, That was not easy, it was very hard
trump, But what we've done … You know the wall now is past 300 miles
trump, It's exactly the wall that our great Border Patrol wanted
trump, I was hoping a nice concrete plank for the builders in here, boom, boom, you put it
trump, Sir, we have to be able to see through
trump, I said, All right, let's go
trump, Much more expensive
trump, I said, Let's go
trump, So we're over 300 miles now and we will be finished with it very soon and we have among the safest borders that we've ever had by far and it's a good time to have it too
trump, That's right
trump, Mexico is going to pay for it
trump, What happens if they fight us Remember that answer It's going to get 10 feet higher
trump, Remember that
trump, What happens if they fight us on the wall The wall's going to get 10 feet higher but now Mexico and I get along great
trump, In fact they have 27,000 soldiers along our southern border protecting us from people coming to our country
trump, Can you imagine that 27,000, and I did that so that we don't put tariffs on their products coming in, it was very simple
trump, I said you got to do it and the president's been great, he's a friend of mine, he's doing a very good job
trump, Not easy, Mexico's not easy, but he's doing a very good job, but the wall is almost completed and it's a tremendous wall
trump, It's everything that the Border Patrol wanted
trump, I gave them everything
trump, I said, What else do you want It's wired for every single thing you could have
trump, Remember the Democrats, We don't want a wall, we want drones flying
trump, Oh that helps us a lot, drones, so you can watch everybody pour in to our country, right Biden supports cutting police funding and he has pledged to end cash bail
trump, Just last week Sleepy Joe proudly accepted the endorsement of the pro-criminal anti-police Portland District Attorney who has a policy of releasing rioters, vandals, criminals and violent extremists without charge
trump, Now last night though, they arrested more than they've ever done because we said you have to
trump, We said you have to and we told them about … We will federalize them, we'll do whatever you need and I spoke to the governor, it looks like they're finally, after 107 days, like they're finally doing what they're supposed to be doing but we'll let you know very soon
trump, Otherwise we're going in
trump, The Biden-Bernie manifesto pledges to implement these same policies nationwide
trump, Now you got to understand, Bernie's a radical lefty but not as bad as her but a radical left and I got a lot of Bernie voters
trump, I think 15 last time because they agree with me on trade
trump, They understand that many of these countries including our so-called allies are ripping us off, they're ripping us off on trade
trump, I agree with him on that
trump, The difference is I know how to do something about it, they don't
trump, They don't have a clue
trump, They just know they're being ripped off, and a lot of Bernie people feel that
trump, That's a big point and they came over and they voted for me instead of Crooked Hillary which was a very nice thing
trump, We appreciate it, we hope we don't lose it
trump, Because we've really implemented things
trump, We've taken in billions and billions and billions of dollars for China, from China, and China's never given us 0
trump,10
trump, It's a one-way street with China
trump, They haven't given us … We signed a great trade deal but the ink wasn't dry when the plague came in so I view that trade deal much differently than I did before, much differently
trump, It's a great deal
trump, They just last week, they ordered the biggest order of corn in history, the biggest order of soybeans in history, and I say just shows you though they're smart, very smart
trump, Instead of saying he's not talking very nicely about us and we're not going to order any more, we're not going to do business, no
trump, Instead they do the opposite
trump, They give us the biggest orders … Our farmers are very happy
trump, Our farmers are very happy
trump, Biggest order of corn, biggest order of beef, biggest order of soybeans, and I gave the farmers 28 billion because that's what you were targeted for by China and I gave you 28 out of the tariffs and we had tens of billions of dollars left over which went into the U
trump,S
trump, Treasury but nobody's ever done this before
trump, Nobody's ever done this before
trump, With Biden it's the reverse
trump, His son goes, sits down for 10 minutes with the father and whoever the hell they sat down with
trump, Walks out with one and a half billion dollars to manage, he'll make millions of dollars a year, and he has no experience at all
trump, Never happened before
trump, Biden's plan is to appease the domestic terrorists
trump, My plan is to arrest them
trump, So on November 3 America faces a very simple choice
trump, Do what you want, vote for the candidate backed by violent left wing rioters if you have to, or do what you want to vote for the candidate backed by the selfless heroes of law enforcement and just about everybody else
trump, Wait till you see the numbers
trump, Wait till you see the numbers
trump, You know there was a poll that just came out, I think it was Gallup, and it was a weird kind of a poll because it said 62 of the people that are polled are lying
trump, I said, That's a big number, right I think it was 62 a couple of weeks ago it came out, and they're only lying if it's us because they don't want to be bothered
trump, In other words they're not lying about Sleepy Joe, they're lying about us, and I don't know if I'm supposed to love that or hate it, I don't know if it's an insult or not but I will take it
trump, We don't give a damn
trump, If that's the case, we have a virtual landslide going
trump, We have a virtual landslide and this would look like it it would have been terrible, but you know what Fortunately we had really talented people taking down everything word for word
trump, We had the call perfectly and if I didn't have it, somehow with these people I guess I'd still be here if you want to know the truth, but it was a lot easier but we were 196 to nothing, the Republicans stuck together, and Kevin McCarthy's done a fantastic job
trump, He really has
trump, With the exception of a half a vote from Mitt Romney, you can have him
trump, He's not too popular, I want to tell you, he's not a very popular guy in Utah
trump, He's not too popular
trump, So it was 52
trump,5 to a half
trump, He's a beauty, I'll tell you that guy
trump, He couldn't get elected dogcatcher in Utah right now
trump, Remember Utah, they said it's too close to call, this was before the election, and they announced Utah, the polls are closed, Donald Trump has won the state of Utah
trump, Do you remember that like immediately I won by a lot and there was some guy running, McMuffin, McMuffin
trump, McMuffin, he was supposed to be second
trump, Even Hillary beat him
trump, What a group
trump, Lieutenant Governor Dan Forest, Dan Get out and vote for him
trump, Get out and vote for him, okay I'll tell you he'll be a great governor
trump, He loves your state, he'll be a great governor
trump, Thom is going to be a great, great senator for another six years, we need them both and I hope you're going to do well, Dan
trump, I know you're really getting up there, it's getting very close
trump, I'll be honest, if this governor that you have, I know him
trump, You know we had to take our convention away, he said you're allowed to have 10 people in the arena, 10, because it said one room 10, you're not supposed to have political rallies
trump, I said, You know the money that your state is going to be losing But if this guy doesn't open up your state, because almost all of them are open now, if he doesn't open up your state, you have no choice, you're going to vote for him anyway but Dan, you'll be so good
trump, Dan Forest, go and vote
trump, The Republican nominee for North Carolina Attorney General, Jim O'Neill
trump, Jim Where is Jim Thank you Jim, thank you very much
trump, Good luck
trump, Got to be careful with those ballots, watch those ballots
trump, I don't like it, you know you have a Democrat governor, you have all these Democrats watching that stuff
trump, I don't like it
trump, I look at these crowds and if they're going to cheat crowds are meaningless
trump, Really, if they're going to cheat, these big beautiful crowds, you could have 15,000, you could have 50,000, these crowds are meaningless
trump, Watch it, be poll watchers when you go there
trump, Watch all the thieving and stealing and robbing they do
trump, Because this is important, we win North Carolina, we win
trump, We're going to win Florida, I just left Florida, we're going to win Florida
trump, North Carolina Republican Party Chairman Michael Whatley North Carolina, great
trump, Thank you Michael
trump, Thank you, great job, and a very good friend of mine, a great guy, Mick Mulvaney
trump, Where's Mick Oh, I didn't know Mick was here
trump, Look at him
trump, What a good guy
trump, Thank you Mick
trump, We have a lot of big shots over there I see but what do you think about a guy named Mark Meadows, chief of staff We love Mark
trump, Doing a great job
trump, He's doing a great job, Robert O'Brien
trump, Robert, how many hostages have you and I negotiated to get back, not giving anything but we have a record of what, Robert 50, 50 and 0
trump, We're 50 and 0 on hostages
trump, We got them back, we got hostages back from countries that you'd never even heard of and it's been pretty amazing
trump, Robert, thank you very much and thank you all for being here
trump, Mick it's good to see you
trump, Oh wait a minute, wait
trump, It's a very, very outstanding senator
trump, Oh I'm lucky I got to see that
trump, We love South Carolina, right Come here
trump, Lindsey Graham everybody, Lindsey Graham
trump, Lindsey and Tim Scott, two great ones
trump, Two great ones
trump, They may be from a different state but they love you Lindsey
trump, That's good and Tim is another one
trump, So we have just incredible people in the party
trump, We've achieved more in four years than anyone ever thought possible and that's driving them crazy
trump, We passed massive tax cuts like nobody ever thought was possible for hardworking families and we eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations, more than any president in history whether it was four years, eight years or in one case more, regulations, and to keep family farms in the family, we eliminated the unfair estate tax also known as the death tax on your small farms and businesses
trump, Remember, that was a terrible thing
trump, People were fighting for that, your family lost the farm, lost – 53
trump, No, but it was a terrible thing
trump, You'd pass away and your kids would get the farm, they'd go out and borrow a lot of money because the estate tax was massive
trump, They'd put big mortgages on the farm, they'd lose the farm, they'd lose the business
trump, You don't have that anymore
trump, I saved the US auto industry by withdrawing from the last administration's job-killing catastrophe, the Trans-Pacific Partnership was a disaster
trump, For half a century, Joe Biden shook hands with blue collar workers, and then he turned around and immediately stabbed them in the back
trump, Biden supported NAFTA, China's entry into the World Trade Organization, TPP, the South Korea disaster deal and mass amnesty for illegal aliens
trump, Think of it
trump, But the big deal is, he's changed
trump, He's changed
trump, After 47 years I've changed
trump, I swear to you I've changed
trump, Did you see him in the debates He was not too good, but that's okay
trump, He was better against Bernie
trump, Something's going on there, I don't know
trump, You know what I'm talking about
trump, But he was better against Bernie
trump, But in the other debates, he was giving them everything they want
trump, Free healthcare for people that come into the country illegally, colleges, everything
trump, Now the new deal, under the new deal, they get lawyers
trump, If they come in to our country illegally, we supply them with legal advice
trump, You believe it lawyers This is what we need, is more lawyers
trump, This state lost 43 of all manufacturing jobs after the twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance into the World Trade Organization
trump, That's courtesy of Biden and his friends
trump, Earlier this year, I kept my promise to North Carolina when we ended the NAFTA nightmare and we signed the brand new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law, it's been incredible
trump, Everyone said, Impossible
trump, They all said it was impossible to get done, we got it done
trump, And it's a great deal
trump, And it prevents people, it prevents companies from fleeing your state, opening up in Mexico or Canada, making a product, selling it to us with… It's such a disincentive to do that
trump, Now that was the thing that was most important to me
trump, I used to hate when I'd see all these companies leaving our country, going to Mexico in particular, but Canada also, a lot of them going to Canada and they'd make a product, everybody gets fired in our country, they close their business and they make the same product in a different country, they send it back to us, no tax at the border, no tariff, no nothing
trump, It doesn't work that way anymore
trump, I took the toughest ever action to stand up to China's pillaging, plundering, ransacking, and rampant theft of North Carolina jobs and US jobs
trump, Joe Biden's agenda is made in China, my agenda is made in the USA
trump, In the face of China's economic aggression, we provided a historic 28 billion in relief to our amazing farmers
trump, I will always stand with American agriculture
trump, These are the greatest people, the finest people, and we're not going to let others take advantage of them
trump, For 20 years, for 20 years, you look at a chart, it's just been this way for 20 years
trump, Now, it's going back up
trump, I mean, it helped that I gave you 28 billion in all fairness, right If I didn't do that, and I took it all from China, it was very easy
trump, If I didn't do that, I think you wouldn't have any farmers right now
trump, Really
trump, It was a difference between having farmers that are doing well and having no farmers
trump, 28 billion over two years, they got hit one year, 16 billion, one year 12 billion
trump, I said to Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture, great guy, an ex-farmer, governor of Georgia for eight years, great guy
trump, I said, Sonny, how much are they being targeted for He said, Sir, 12 billion for the year before, and last year sir was 16
trump, So I said, 28, okay, that's fine
trump, I said, We will give them 28 billion
trump, They were unfairly targeted
trump, And that was in order to get me, and by the way, China wants Joe Biden so badly
trump, Oh, they want… And you know who else would like them very badly Iran would like them very badly
trump, Because I ended that Iran catastrophe that we paid 150 billion and 1
trump,8 billion, in cash
trump, And you know what's going to happen They're just waiting for the election because the country is going down the tubes
trump, Their GDP went down 24
trump, Nobody ever heard of that before
trump, Their country is in trouble
trump, I don't want them to be in trouble, but they're going to wait till after the election
trump, When I win the election, they're going to come to us and make a deal so fast
trump, Watch how fast it'll be
trump, They're dying to make a deal, but they do want to wait
trump, Let's wait two months, maybe we'll get lucky
trump, Maybe we're going to get lucky and Slow Joe gets in and we're going to make a great deal
trump, No, there'll be in immediately after the election and they'll make a deal, we'll make a fair deal with them
trump, But what Obama did and Biden did with that horrible Iran deal
trump, I ended last administration's war on American energy
trump, Biden has pledged to end production of American oil shale, clean coal, no fracking, wiping out millions of jobs and forcing us to buy energy from foreign polluters
trump, We don't want to buy energy
trump, We've done that for a long time, for decades and decades
trump, We don't want to do that anymore
trump, I like being energy independent, don't you And I'm sure that most of you notice when you go to fill up your tank of gas in your car, oftentimes it's below 2
trump, You said, How the hell did this ever happen Thank you President Trump
trump, Right Thank you President Trump And look at your electric bills, everything else
trump, These guys, your electric would go up four, five, six times
trump, The Green New Deal, it's called the green new nightmare
trump, While I'm president, America will remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas on earth and we will remain energy independent
trump, It should be for many, many years to come
trump, Because the fact is, we don't have to be in the Middle East other than we want to protect Israel
trump, We've been very good to Israel
trump, But other than that, we don't have to be in the Middle East
trump, We don't need… There was a time we needed desperately, we don't need that anymore
trump, We have more than they do, isn't that nice After years of rebuilding other countries, we are finally building our country
trump, America first
trump, It's America first
trump, To bring hope to our inner cities, I created opportunities zones
trump, I worked with Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, what a great guy
trump, He has passed criminal justice reform, prison reform, delivered permanent funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities that Obama never did, or couldn't do
trump, And Biden
trump, I call it Obiden
trump, O Biden
trump, It's too long to say Obama and Biden, just call it Obiden
trump, And before the China virus, we achieved the lowest African American, Hispanic American, Asian American unemployment rates ever recorded
trump, And we're heading back to that level rapidly
trump, Biden spent the last 47 years betraying African American voters
trump, He betrayed them
trump, Look at 1994, take a look at that
trump, He betrayed them, what he did to them
trump, He closed the factories in Baltimore and sent them to Beijing
trump, They were all sent to Beijing
trump, So many people went there
trump, They went to all parts of the world, but a lot went to Beijing
trump, He shattered the plants in Chicago and sent them to Shanghai
trump, Unlike the previous administration, under my administration we put America first
trump, And actually, if we weren't interrupted with constant investigations that went nowhere
trump, And nobody has been through what I've been through as president of the United States, nobody
trump, They used to say Abraham Lincoln got the worst press
trump, I said, There's no way he got worse than me
trump, But Lincoln was very, very badly treated by the fake news
trump, Maybe in his case, it was real
trump, I can tell you, in my case, it's fake
trump, It's totally fake
trump, But nobody's been and should never be allowed to happen again
trump, Let's see what happens
trump, We caught them cold
trump, Let's see what happens
trump, But if we didn't have to… That takes time, and energy, and all other things
trump, 31
trump, She could have said, Okay
trump, She could have said, You got me
trump, But she said, I got set up by the beauty parlor owner, who happens to be a Trump person by the way
trump, I like the beauty parlor owner
trump, She said, I got set up by the owner of the beauty parlor
trump, She set me up
trump, I said, How are you going to deal with Putin, Kim Jong-un, and President Xi of China No, it's terrible, she's always preaching about the mask
trump, You got to wear the mask at all times, indoor, outdoor
trump, When you go to bed at night, put the mask on
trump, I've spent the last four years keeping my promises and delivering for the African American community and when I'm reelected the best is yet to come
trump, I'll tell you that
trump, Perhaps in no area have our opponents more thoroughly betrayed working families of all backgrounds than on the subject of immigration
trump, Under my administration, we've achieved the most secure border in American history
trump, Now, I have to tell you the 300 miles of wall helps a lot
trump, Remember they said, Walls are old fashioned
trump, They don't work
trump, Really I always say, and I've said it four or five times
trump, I'll say it again if you'd like me to, two things if you come back in a thousand years, 2000 years, or 3000 years
trump, If you're lucky enough, assuming we have something with the world is a crazy place, isn't it But if you come back in a thousand years, there are two things, with all the computers, and all the everything changes every day, you invent a new cell, you invent a new laptop
trump, Everything is obsolete like about two weeks after you invent it, right Two things that will never get obsolete, the wall and the wheel, right The wheel and the wall
trump, Maybe I'm wrong, who knows But I would say walls and wheels have a great future
trump, We ended catch and release, stopped asylum fraud, and we've deported 20,000 gang members, including the radical MS-13
trump, We invested 2
trump,5 trillion in the United States Military, all made in the USA by the way, We have the newest, finest military we've ever had, and gave our great warriors their largest pay raises in many, many decades
trump, We passed VA Choice and VA Accountability which everybody said could not happen, and veterans satisfaction with the VA has just reached 91, the highest satisfaction level in history
trump, I withdrew from the last administration's disastrous Iran nuclear deal as I said, and I kept my promise and recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the United States embassy in Jerusalem
trump, And then I recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and we achieved the first breakthrough in the Middle East peace for many, many decades, decades
trump, Even the New York Times said that was an amazing achievement
trump, Do you believe that I said, Let me see that one
trump, Now we did something that nobody thought was possible
trump, Man, it's Israel, as you see, and as you've read, Israel and UAE, highly respected leader, Mohammed, highly, highly respected, and now we have other countries in the Middle East
trump, They all want to come in
trump, It's going to be a beautiful picture, going to be a beautiful picture
trump, We killed the vicious founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi, we killed him
trump, Why didn't Biden get himk They were after him for eight years, they never got him, I got him
trump, The world's number one terrorist and the mass murderer of American crews, Qasem Soleimani, we got him too
trump, Soleimani
trump, Al-Baghdadi and Soleimani, the two worst terrorists in the world for many, many years, many decades
trump, We kept America out of new wars and we're bringing our troops back home
trump, We're bringing them back home from all these far away places
trump, We spend hundreds of billions of dollars, and what do we get out of it Biden voted for the Iraq war, he supported the defense sequester that gutted our military, he opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden, he opposed the killing of Soleimani, he oversaw the rise of ISIS, and for eight years he couldn't find or kill al-Baghdadi, the founder of ISIS
trump, Couldn't find him, they looked, they couldn't find him
trump, I found him and we hit him good
trump, We hit him good
trump, And you saw the Mueller family on television
trump, You saw that at the convention, what al-Baghdadi did with their beautiful daughter, and incredible how our troops handled that
trump, You should see it, it was incredible
trump, Biden also cheered the rise of China as a positive development, positive development for America and for the world
trump, How are we doing with China We just have the plague, we've had other plagues sent by them
trump, I wonder if they did it on purpose, what do you think I got to tell you, I was sailing to an easy election
trump, This was going to be so easy
trump, I probably would have not been here tonight
trump, I would have said, No, we don't have to bother
trump, This is going to be… And now we have to work against a guy that doesn't know where he is, I can't believe it
trump, When I banned travel from China, Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic
trump, Do you remember that I banned it
trump, Everybody told me, No, no, no, you don't have to do that
trump, But I said, We have to because Wuhan is very infected and they're coming here, so I banned it
trump, Later on it was said to be a great move
trump, If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died
trump, If Biden wins, China will own America, and it won't take long, with his son, Hunter walking out with all of that money with no experience whatsoever, no investment…He didn't even have a job
trump, Joe Biden is weak and will always cave to China who is strong
trump, When the virus arrived, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II
trump, We're delivering life-saving therapies and we have achieved some of the great numbers
trump, The case fatality rates, we have the lowest of any major country in the world
trump, People don't know that because the fake news doesn't want to write about it
trump, Under Operation Warp Speed, we're producing a vaccine in record time
trump, This is a vaccine that we're going to have very soon, very, very soon, by the end of the year, but much sooner than that, perhaps
trump, And this is something that's incredible
trump, This would have taken two or three years by the last administration, and in all fairness, by most other administrations
trump, We have upped it to a level that nobody even believes is possible, and totally safe
trump, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, rated the most liberal, are undermining science and risking countless lives with their reckless anti-vaccine rhetoric
trump, That's what they're talking about
trump, So now they know we have it
trump, It's only a question of weeks or a small amount of time
trump, So instead of saying, That's a great thing
trump, We're going to save lives, they're trying to disparage it, they're trying to make it politics
trump, They're trying to do so
trump, And now what's going to happen is we'll have it, and people won't want to take it
trump, That's really bad
trump, Okay That's really bad
trump, But the Biden-Harris effort to spread anti-vaccine conspiracy theories only because they know we're close to putting it out, getting it out, and we're going to get it out fast
trump, The vaccine will be safe
trump, These are the greatest companies in the world to do this, the greatest labs, the greatest doctors, it'll be effective and it'll be delivered before the end of the year
trump, And maybe as I said, much sooner than that
trump, Joe Biden's plan to impose a blanket shutdown would collapse our economy and cause countless deaths from suicide, drugs, alcohol abuse, heart disease, and much more
trump, And that's what you're in right now
trump, You're in a shutdown
trump, It's crazy
trump, I've been to many states, they're not in shutdowns and they're doing better
trump, They're doing better
trump, Somebody's got to speak to this man, Dan
trump, Maybe you got to talk to him, Dan
trump, Go in a little early and say, You don't know what the hell you're doing You don't know what you're doing
trump, They're hurting our people
trump, North Carolina has to open up
trump, By contrast, my administration is following the science, protecting those at highest risk while allowing those at lower risk to safely return to work and to school, go back to school, go back to school
trump, You ever see the statistics on young people I don't know
trump, They have a great immune system
trump, Let's get some of that immune system, but they're amazing
trump, I mean, thousands and thousands of people and they're not even affected, very little meaning a small percentage of 1
trump, It's an incredible thing
trump, Nobody knew that when it first came here, nobody assumed a thing like that was possible
trump, But young people are very strong against this horrible disease
trump, Through our historic China virus relief programs, we've saved more than 1
trump,3 million jobs for North Carolina workers
trump, That worked out great
trump, We provided 380 million in relief for North Carolina farmers and made 10 million in PPP loans to save- … And made 10 million in PPP loans to save your state's tobacco growers
trump, We saved your tobacco growers
trump, We have them very much in our sites
trump, We want to help them
trump, The Biden agenda would crush this comeback and put our families in grave danger
trump, Biden is promising to reimpose job-destroying regulations
trump, We got rid of more regulations, he wants to put those regulations back plus 50
trump, You couldn't build a road
trump, We took roads from 18, 19, and even 20 years approval down to two and we'll have it down to one
trump, You may get rejected for a highway or for a road, but you're going to know in the period of 12 months to 24 months
trump, You're not going to spend an entire lifetime and then have them raise their hand
trump, I know all about it from the real estate business, we brought it all the way down
trump, He wants to give illegal aliens government healthcare and taxpayer funded lawyers, establish a national sanctuary city policy for illegal aliens with criminal records
trump, You wouldn't believe
trump, I mean, this stuff is not even really believable, but it is what it is
trump, He wants to surge refugee admissions by 700 into our country
trump, Flooding your towns with poorly vetted migrants, including many from jihadist regions of the world
trump, Biden opposes school choice, he opposes North Carolina opportunity scholarships
trump, And he has stated that if he is elected, charter schools are gone
trump, He said, they're gone
trump, And they've been incredible
trump, In the second term I'll provide school choice to every parent in America
trump, And we'll also take good care of our teachers
trump, Our teachers are very, very important to me
trump, Very important, nothing more important
trump, A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans
trump, And just in finishing, I have to say that over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world
trump, And we will end our reliance on China once and for all
trump, We'll make our medical supplies right here in the United States
trump, We will enact fair trade deals that create American jobs and grow American wages
trump, We are going to bring our companies back home where they should be
trump, I've been doing a lot of it, but we are going to do it at a level that nobody ever thought possible
trump, We will rapidly return to full employment, soaring wages, and record prosperity
trump, We will hire more police, increased penalties for assaults or law enforcement, surge, federal prosecutors into high crime communities and ban all sanctuary cities
trump, We will protect government benefits for American citizens, not for illegal aliens
trump, What you're doing when you have all of these advantages, when you're giving them free healthcare, and free lawyers, and free college, and free everything, they all come
trump, They didn't think of coming, but they see this, they talk and they talk to their friends and they all come in
trump, They want to come to America
trump, You're just bringing people in and we don't want to do that
trump, We want people to come to our country, but they have to come in through merit and they have to come in legally, very simple
trump, We will appoint prosecutors, judges, and justices who believe in enforcing the law, not their own political agenda
trump, We will ensure equal justice for the citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed
trump, We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life
trump, We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms
trump, We will strike down terrorists to threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of endless ridiculous foreign wars
trump, We'll build up our military like it's never been built up before
trump, We need our military for other reasons
trump, We will have the strongest we have now
trump, When I took over, our military was depleted
trump, We have a lot of military people here
trump, Our military was depleted, our planes were 50 years old
trump, Now you have brand new, beautiful F35s, we have brand new rockets and missiles
trump, And hopefully we never have to use them, I will say that
trump, But the best way of not having to use them is to have them
trump, If you have them… We learned that in the school yards, right We learned that in the school yards, the best way is to have them
trump, We have the strongest military we've ever had by far
trump, We'll end surprise medical billing require, price transparency, which I've already signed into law, which by the way, kicks in on January 1st
trump, You better elect me North Carolina
trump, I did price transparency and I've cut the price
trump, Drugs are going to start going down at levels nobody's ever seen favored nations
trump, So we did price transparency, kicks in January 1st
trump, Could you imagine if this guy's president and your prices start to go way down, hospitalization, doctors, you can choose your own doctor unlike with Obama, right Price is going way down, January 1st
trump, I said, couldn't you start it sooner, but statutorily that's when it had it start
trump, Could you imagine if this guy's in and prices start dropping like a rock And they'll say, What a great president he is
trump, He would have never done it
trump, And your drug prices, prescription drug, I'm instituting favorite nations laws
trump, So we're going to pay what other nations pay at the lowest
trump, And you'rr going to get back rebates that were given to middlemen who have to be the richest people in the world
trump, We'll protect medicare and social security, and we will protect your social security
trump, And we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions, always
trump, America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars
trump, Very exciting
trump, And I will reopen NASA
trump, That place was gone
trump, They had grass growing out of the runways, you had to see it
trump, Now it's the number one space center in the world by far
trump, You see what's going on
trump, We will restore patriotic education to our schools
trump, Oh, you know what I'm talking about
trump, Look at you
trump, This is a very sophisticated group, Tom
trump, You know what I'm talking about, patriotic education
trump, Well, the first thing they do is they want to take your history away
trump, That's a great group behind me
trump, I don't know
trump, They're activists
trump, But you know what You know what it means, they want to take away your history
trump, That's why the monuments and the statutes, they want to knock them down
trump, The first thing they do is take away your guts
trump, It's guts
trump, They take away your guts, they take away your statues, they take away your heroes
trump, They take away your great generals
trump, They take away your past
trump, And I said, it was going to happen
trump, I said, You know what They started off with generals and colonels and others that nobody ever heard of
trump, And I thought that was bad
trump, And then they went up a little bit and now I said, Someday it's going to be Robert Lee, someday it's going to be Washington, someday it's going to be Lincoln
trump, Someday it's going to be Jefferson, someday it's going to be Benjamin Franklin
trump, It's all of them
trump, They take away your past
trump, They never taken away our past
trump, That's the way they do it
trump, You study it
trump, That's the way they go
trump, They take away your guts
trump, We'll teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag
trump, And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God we trust
trump, This is better than the arenas, I have to say, especially when you have a crowd like this
trump, But they're like this
trump, They have such spirit in this country
trump, People love our country so much
trump, I went to Texas, I went to Ohio, I went to Florida, it's always like this
trump, They love our country and we're not going to disappoint anybody
trump, We're not disappointed
trump, For years you had a president who apologized for America… So you had a president who apologized for America, now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the people of North Carolina
trump, This is the most important election in the history of our country
trump, I wouldn't say that lightly
trump, And frankly, I thought the last one was, and I said it, but they've gone to a level that nobody even thought possible
trump, These people have gotten stone cold, crazy
trump, And you know what After we get in, we're going to have tremendous success
trump, And it was building
trump, We were at a point, we were so successful before the plague came in from China
trump, We were so successful that we were starting to get together
trump, People forget
trump, We were starting… Success brings people together
trump, It was so good
trump, Our jobs numbers were so good
trump, And whether it was the Black community, the Hispanic community, the Asian community, our jobs were so good, our numbers were so good
trump, We were getting together and then the plague came in and we had to stop
trump, We had to close it up
trump, We had to open it and start all over again
trump, If you would have told me that we have one of the highest stock market, some of the stock markets have already broken every record
trump, You look at NASDAQ, you look at some… We're far ahead of what I had planned
trump, We're far ahead of schedule
trump, But we did it once, we have to do it again because this was an unforeseen event, a terrible event, a horrible event
trump, So many people died
trump, Nobody should have died, not one person
trump, So many people died, but if we didn't do it right, we would have lost millions of people
trump, Just a terrible thing
trump, But oftentimes I say, bring people together
trump, And then I realized, if you look at that last few months, we were starting to come together
trump, I was getting calls from, you won't believe it, Democrats
trump, I was getting calls from Democrats and they were saying, Wow, things are going really well
trump, It was starting to happen and now we have to get it back to a level of great success because it'll happen again
trump, There'll be great unity, eventually there'll be great unity
trump, So get your friends, and get your family, get your neighbors, and your coworkers and vote
trump, And I say this because it's from Charlotte to Kitty Hawk, from Durham to Asheville, and from Wilmington to right here in Winston-Salem
trump, We inherit the legacy of North Carolina Patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation
trump, We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blaze the trails, settle the continent, tame the wilderness, dug out the Panama canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industry, one, two world Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world
trump, And we are making it greater than ever before
trump, Proud and great citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country
trump, We are returning power to you, the American people
trump, With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning
trump, We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God
trump, And together with the incredible people of North Carolina, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again
trump, Thank you North Carolina
trump, Thank you
trump, 
trump,Oh, thank you very much, everybody
trump, Thank you
trump, Well, thank you very much
trump, Thank you very much
trump, And considering that we caught President Obama and sleepy Joe Biden, spying on our campaign, treason, will probably be entitled to another four more years after that
trump, I wanted to thank you, and Art and Brandon, you're incredible
trump, I've known you now a long time
trump, Right from the beginning, we had the chemistry, we had that good chemistry… Oh, sit down
trump, It's 122 degrees in this place
trump, And we have our great Governor
trump, Governor, can we make it a little bit, just a little
trump, This is like a test
trump, You think Joe Biden could do this I don't think so
trump, So I'm thrilled to be in Yuma, Arizona To proudly accept the endorsement of the National Border Patrol Council, that's a big deal
trump, And they are great friends of mine
trump, And we're building the wall
trump, Next week, we'll be up to 300 miles of incredible wall
trump, And our numbers are the best
trump, We are very tough at the border
trump, When people want to come in, for our farmers, et cetera, et cetera, we're not going to hurt our farmers, but we've never had better numbers than we have right now
trump, And that's been helped because we're at a little bit over 280 miles right now, we have never been helped like this
trump, Wall, there are two things, in a thousand years you can come back, two things will never, with technology it's obsolete before you even put it in the box, but two things never get old wheels and walls
trump, Wheels and wall
trump, If you come back in a thousand years, you'll say, Well, we still have wheels in walls
trump, And that's the only thing you'll recognize
trump, The National Border Patrol Council is the official union representing the incredible heroes of the United States Border Patrol
trump, They've been my friends from the beginning
trump, To every border agent, and I just met some unbelievable people backstage, these are great people, and every family member here today, you have earned the everlasting gratitude of our nation
trump, And I want to thank you very much
trump, Thank you very much
trump, As you know, better than anyone, the survival of our nation is at stake in this election
trump, And I will tell you, I never thought I'd say it because we had a great election
trump, We had a great election a little while ago
trump, Four years ago, I never thought I'd say anything could compete with 2016
trump, This election that we're going into is the most important election in the history of our country, because we had crooked Hillary, but this is something, these people are sick
trump, And we have to make sure that this radical left socialist and beyond, because this is beyond socialism, that it doesn't happen, or we will indeed have Venezuela on steroids
trump, So we can't do it
trump, Most important election, November 3rd, get out and vote
trump, Joe Biden is the puppet of the radical left wing movement that seeks the complete elimination of America's borders and boundaries
trump, They want to take the wall down, they don't want to have borders, they want to have sanctuary cities, lots of bad things they want
trump, Following orders from his boss
trump, I guess his new boss is Bernie Sanders
trump, Can you believe that Crazy Bernie
trump, Joe Biden has pledged to abolish immigration enforcement, suspend all removals, provide free government healthcare, and they want to give it to illegal aliens
trump, You don't get it
trump, Restore, catching and release
trump, Shield violent criminal aliens
trump, This is what they want to do
trump, And give every illegal alien on the planet earth a free ticket to invent an asylum claim, and gain automatic admission into our country
trump, We will have people coming into our country that never even thought of it before
trump, You get free education, you get free healthcare, why wouldn't they come Let's go to America
trump, The Biden plan would unleash a flood of illegal immigration like the world has never seen
trump, It's crazy
trump, Biden's plan is the most radical, extreme, reckless, dangerous, and deadly immigration plan ever put forward by a major party candidate
trump, It must be defeated, and it will be defeated on November 3rd
trump, It will be defeated
trump, At last night's Democrat convention, which by the way, got very bad ratings, I have to tell you
trump, Unity
trump, They talk about unity
trump, They want to bring unity
trump, And then you listen to Michelle Obama's speech, which was obsolete by the time it got there
trump, She taped it
trump, No, she taped the speech
trump, It was obsolete
trump, She must have taped it about three weeks before
trump, I'm speaking next Thursday, maybe I'll tape it
trump, But I don't think that goes
trump, That's so much nicer, to tape it, you do it, nice air conditioned room
trump, And she not only taped it, but tell me when you hear a divisive speech… They talk about me as being a divider
trump, I'm not a divider
trump, I bring people together
trump, We were bringing people together
trump, We were bringing people together, like never before
trump, Success was bringing everyone together, and then we got hit with the China virus, but we were bringing people together
trump, But one of the opening speakers last night said that America will go to hell if we don't have open borders
trump, Think of that
trump, Go to hell
trump, When a country doesn't have borders, you don't have a country
trump, Today, a Democrat speaker at the convention said, We're talking about abolishing the police, we're talking about abolishing ICE, we're talking about abolishing prisons
trump, Biden's campaign has turned into a cult for open border and others Zealots
trump, By the way, they want to double and triple your taxes, they want to increase regulations, they want to spend very little money on our vets, after we took care of our vets better than anyone's
trump, 91 approval rate
trump, And they want to spend much less on our military, we've totally rebuilt
trump, Two and a half trillion dollars, we've totally rebuilt our military
trump, Bernie Sanders declared, in his speech, many of the ideas that just a few years ago were considered radical, are now mainstream
trump, That's Bernie Sanders
trump, Because Joe, he doesn't know where he is
trump, But if he did, he's been brought so far left that our country will not be the country that we know
trump, It will have problems, it will go down
trump, Your stocks will be gone, your 401ks will disappear
trump, And right now, who has the 401k And then the rest of you, many of you have stocks, and you do it a different way
trump, That will go down 50, 60, 70, 80
trump, And if you held on, like I said to do, we went down a little while we got hit with a virus
trump, Now, NASDAQ just broke an all time record
trump, SNP, just broke an all time record
trump, Socialism is the mainstream of the Biden campaign and it's not the mainstream of America
trump, Remember I said, we will never have a socialist country
trump, On November 3rd
trump, The people of Arizona, our great state, we love Arizona
trump, I won it last time, by a lot
trump, And I hear we're going to win it by even more this time
trump, Don't forget, last time I talked, I said we're going to give you a tax cuts, I gave you
trump, I said, we're going to give you a massive regulation cuts
trump, Give you your tax cuts, I gave them to you
trump, I said we're going to give you massive regulation cuts, we're going to give you great everything
trump, We even did Right to Try medicine
trump, You know all about that
trump, We did things that I didn't even talk about it, we did
trump, We did a thing called the Space Force
trump, You never heard me talking about
trump, I'm the only candidate that gave you more than I promised in the campaign
trump, It's true
trump, I'm the only one ever, maybe ever
trump, Or we'll head to the polls and together we'll stop the left and win four more years in the White House
trump, We're joined today by some incredible people, friends of mine, great, great people
trump, And I want to congratulate your governor because we had a spike and he knocked that spike out so fast
trump, I don't know
trump, Are you sure you even had a spike Doug Ducey, a great governor, great man, and a somebody that won by about 16 or 17 points
trump, That's not so bad
trump, And I think you're more popular today
trump, What a job you've done
trump, Thank you very much, Doug
trump, A friend of mine and somebody who's a great fighter pilot, and I had a lot of people tell me she could really wheel the Warthog, right The Warthog
trump, She said, I love that plane, but she was a great, great fighter pilot, one of the best they were telling me
trump, This was a group and they knew a very well
trump, A lot of friends you have
trump, And specifically she said, Could you extend that plane That's the best plane
trump, It never breaks down
trump, It just is a winner
trump, But Martha McSally is an extraordinary person, and she's fighting for us, and she's helping us, and we have to bring her into the center
trump, Thank you, Martha
trump, And she's running against a gentlemen who is, when you read what he's done, when you read what he said about the second amendment and about all other things, you're not going to want to vote for
trump, You're not going to want to have them play with your second amendment
trump, I'll tell you what
trump, If I weren't President, I don't believe, Doug, you'd have a second amendment right now
trump, I don't think you'd have
trump, The pressure that was put on to get rid of it, or to basically obliterate it, make it so it's meaningless
trump, You will always have the right to bear arms
trump, You will always have that
trump, A few friends of mine who are warriors
trump, Paul Gosar
trump, Paul
trump, Where's Paul Paul, stand up
trump, Will you Paul Gosar
trump, Thank you, Paul
trump, Appreciate
trump, Great job you're doing
trump, These are warriors
trump, They really are
trump, When they went and they tried to make a play at your President, they had to get through the House
trump, What were we 197 and nothing
trump, That's never happened before
trump, Everybody came together
trump, The Republicans came
trump, Other than Mitt Romney, one half a vote
trump, One half a brain
trump, Another friend of mine and incredible fighter, and somebody that loves his state, and I'll tell you, the Freedom Caucus, right And we have a man named Andy Biggs here
trump, He's a fighter
trump, He's a fighter
trump, And he loves our vets, and he loves our military, and you love our second amendment, right And we're not going to do anything with it
trump, They will destroy that second amendment
trump, Just remember I said it, but you're not going to have to worry about it because it's not going to happen
trump, A woman who really distinguished herself, she became a star
trump, She became a star overnight
trump, There was nobody tougher
trump, There was nobody smarter
trump, There was nobody better than Debbie Lesko
trump, Great job, Debbie
trump, Thank you
trump, We want her on our side
trump, Right fellas We got to have her on our side
trump, Also, thanks to Arizona Republican party chairman, I knew this was going to happen
trump, I knew that she was going
trump, She never stops
trump, She never gives up
trump, Kelly Ward
trump, Kelly, thank you
trump, Thank you, Kelly
trump, Great job you're doing
trump, Are we winning Okay, good
trump, I think we are
trump, That's what they say
trump, We better win
trump, If we don't win, this country is in big trouble
trump, Big trouble
trump, Also a great friend of all of ours, former State Treasurer of Arizona, Jeff DeWitt
trump, Thank you Jeff
trump, And a man who didn't choke under pressure
trump, I don't even know if he's here
trump, I think he might be here
trump, He never choked
trump, He kicked for 11 years
trump, You know what that is You ever see a golfer
trump, They miss a three footer
trump, They miss a three footer
trump, They can't take it back
trump, They choke, choke, choke
trump, Well, kickers are the same
trump, Right NFL kickers
trump, This guy lasted 11 years
trump, He's one of the best kickers ever
trump, NFL kicker, Jay Feely
trump, Where's Jay Where is Jay He's here someplace
trump, Where is he Jay What happened You couldn't get a good seat, Jay
trump, I remember the 61 yarder
trump, That was a heartbreaker
trump, Right But the only thing is, I'll bet you this man would stand, only stand, for our National Anthem
trump, That's one thing
trump, That's one thing I can tell you
trump, And if they don't stand for our flag, if they don't stand for our National Anthem, I turn off the game
trump, Other than that, I'd like to watch, but I turn off the game
trump, And by the way, I thought they learned that lesson a little while ago
trump, I thought they learned that lesson two years ago, but maybe not, but they will
trump, They'll learn it again
trump, This time it'll go even faster
trump, For decades, Washington politicians like Biden allowed an endless supply of illegal foreign labor to decimate American jobs and wages
trump, Also, the crime was incredible what happened
trump, They allowed criminal gangs to menace, maim and terrorize innocent citizens
trump, They came in
trump, They would maim and terrorize, and we have done something with our border patrol
trump, And by the way, ICE, ICE is great
trump, ICE has taken out thousands and thousands of MS-13, and you don't want the job
trump, There's some tough people here
trump, None of you want the job
trump, It's a tough job, but they like it, and they're great Patriots, and they've done a fantastic job
trump, They ceded control of the border to the most dangerous and ruthless cartels on earth
trump, This is what would happen
trump, They have ceded
trump, And what we've done, did you ever notice the caravans What happened Debbie, there are no more caravans
trump, What happened What happened to the caravans They don't come up anymore
trump, The caravans don't come up
trump, You know, we were paying hundreds of millions of dollars to Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, hundreds of millions
trump, And I said, Well, why are we doing that And they wouldn't take
trump, When we caught a murderer and we wanted to bring it back to one of those countries, they wouldn't take him
trump, And they wouldn't take him under the Obama administration
trump, So we got stuck with them because they'd fly in
trump, They'd say, Don't land your plane
trump, And I said something very simple
trump, I said, That's okay
trump, We don't have to do that
trump, We're not going to pay you anymore
trump, We stopped payment
trump, We stopped payment
trump, It's amazing how that works, Doug
trump, Right We stopped payment and they called
trump, They said, We'd love to take them
trump, We'd be honored to take them
trump, So we take them back by the thousands, by the thousands
trump, They let lethal poisonous drugs pour freely into our schools and our communities, but no more
trump, It's not happening anymore
trump, The cruel and heartless portrayal of the American people ended the day I took the oath of office, and now that we have more than half of the wall built, and do you notice they don't talk about the wall anymore
trump, They don't talk
trump, Why don't you talk I went, Look at all those people back there
trump, That's called fake news, fake news
trump, Look at them
trump, It's the fake news
trump, They don't talk about the wall anymore
trump, See, we won
trump, We got the wall
trump, It's going to be up to 300 next week and it's going to be finished very soon
trump, And as soon as we want, all of a sudden, they never talk about it
trump, But you know where I talk about it Numbers
trump, The numbers are so good
trump, The numbers are so low
trump, We've never had numbers like this because that big portion of wall already built, you don't get through it
trump, You can't get through it
trump, You can climb Mount Everest, and you're going to have an awful hard time getting over that sucker
trump, I stood up to the lobbyists
trump, Everybody fought us, the Democrats, everyone
trump, I fought the special interests
trump, I kept every single promise that I made, and now I'm doing it with the drug companies
trump, I just created Favorite Nation
trump, So if a nation buys it for less and they buy it for a fraction of what we pay, the drug companies have to sell it to us for the same price
trump, And they're spending so much
trump, They're spending millions of dollars on advertising
trump, Anytime you see an ad from a drug company, and they're rich, the farmer, it's called Big Farmer, the number one lobbyist
trump, They spend millions and millions, hundreds of millions of dollars online
trump, Anytime you see, anytime at all, you see an ad by Big Farmer against me, you know your drug prices are coming down
trump, That's what it is
trump, They're not happy
trump, And we're giving the rebate that creates tremendous wealth for the middle man, the rebate
trump, It's going to the people now
trump, We're bringing the rebate and it's going to the people
trump, They are not happy
trump, I have a lot of people in that industry do not like me too much
trump, But you are going to get 50
trump, You are going to get, and the Democrats would never do it, Biden would never do it because he doesn't understand it, but they would never do it
trump, They would in a million years, they wouldn't do it
trump, It took a lot of guts to do it
trump, I had a lot of people, a lot of good politicians go, Sir, I don't think you should do it
trump, I wonder why you're saying that, but we did it
trump, We're going to have drug prices reduced over a very short period of time, by not 2, and last year they went down a little bit, first time in 51 years that drug prices went down but a little bit, we're going to have prices dropping 50, 60, and even 70
trump, Drugs
trump, About time
trump, And I'm proud to say that they've achieved the most secure border, our border patrol, in the history of the United States of America
trump, We now have the most secure border we've ever had and it's only going to get better
trump, And we want people to come in, but we want them to come in through merit, right And we want people- … people to come in, but we want them to come in through merit, right And we want people that are going to come in and are going to love for our country, not hate our country
trump, Here in Yuma, Arizona, we've invested over 1
trump,7 billion and poured 180,000 cubic yards, that's a lot of concrete, to build 108 miles of powerful border wall
trump, I know who's going to vote for me
trump, I don't know though, I think I'm going to win Yuma
trump, What do you think, Doug I think, when I hear those numbers, when we hear those numbers, we're winning
trump, We're going to win Yuma big
trump, Now you see it and you see what's going up and it's an incredible structure, all capable, all wired up for cameras, for everything you can have
trump, Technology is incredible
trump, In total, I've already completely planned for the final execution, we're going to have, by the end of the year, everything that we said is going to be built
trump, We may actually build some more in some soft areas that we've noticed over the last two years
trump, So we actually may put up some additional, but we will have it completed, everything we said, by the end of the year and nobody thought that was possible
trump, And we've reduced illegal border crossings by 60 since this time last year
trump, And if we keep going at the rate, it'll be about 85 in about two months
trump, So it's a great honor
trump, And you know what Your community is much safer, you see the difference, it's a much safer place to be
trump, But more important than these numbers is the fact that we've ended catch and release
trump, You know what catch and release is These great men and women catch somebody, maybe a murderer, maybe a rapist, maybe a trafficker, they catch somebody, take his name, take his number and they release them into our country
trump, And they say, Come back in four years, you have a trial
trump, No more
trump, We take them out
trump, We bring them out
trump, And nobody said that was possible because I couldn't have gotten it through the Democrats because they don't like that
trump, So we have people coming in to this country, some great people, some really bad people too
trump, And I mean murders and I mean rapist, I mean really bad people and they don't get in and they don't get back
trump, When we bring them back to their country, could be Mexico also, they don't come back
trump, Under the Obama Biden, I call it OBiden, Under the OBiden administration, our agents were ordered to ignore the law and release illegal aliens by the hundreds of thousands
trump, And by the way, Mark Morgan, where's the great Mark Morgan He's around here someplace
trump, Mark Morgan has been so incredible, one of our executives, he said, We never built the cages
trump, Those cages were built in 2014 by Obama
trump, We never the cages, they were built by Obama and the fake news is constantly saying that I built cages for children
trump, I didn't build them
trump, They were built in 2014
trump, There was a headline in Time magazine about the cage and somebody called in that built it
trump, They said, He didn't build it, we built that for the Obama administration
trump, But they don't stop, they keep calling it, they say I built the cages
trump, You'll hear it in one of the debates
trump, They'll say, You built cages president
trump, I said, No, I didn't build cages
trump, That was built by Obama
trump, Under the Trump administration, if you cross our border illegally, you are quickly apprehended and swiftly returned back home
trump, We are proudly defending the job safety and security of the American people, which is what I promised to do
trump, Nobody told me it was going to be this hard
trump, Nobody told me I was going to have the Democrats go totally crazy
trump, This was like a life and death war
trump, You know why they don't talk about it anymore Because they know it's bad politics, because they know having a wall, they can't win that one
trump, So they just say, Let's forget it ever happened
trump,' Because we won and they say, Let's forget
trump, They don't want to talk about it
trump, That includes the millions of incredible Hispanic Americans who follow our laws, uplift our community and protect our nation, in uniform
trump, Half of all border patrol agents are Hispanic Americans, I was just with them
trump, And today I salute each and every one of those true American heroes and that's what they are
trump, And nobody understands the border better than Hispanics
trump, They know what's good, what's bad
trump, They don't want bad people coming into our country, taking their jobs, taking their homes, causing crime
trump, Hispanic Americans are the people that are most in favor of what we're doing on the border because they understand it
trump, They understand it better than anybody
trump, With the help of these patriots, we've stopped the rampant asylum fraud, shut down the human smugglers and we're finding the drug dealers, traffickers, predators, and we're throwing them to hell in jail or sending them back home
trump, MS-13, for the first time that you've ever seen this, MS-13 is totally on the run
trump, Many of its leaders are right now behind bars and we're deporting its members in record numbers we've never reported
trump, I can't believe how many there are
trump, But if Biden wins, it will be a giant jail break for MS-13 and vicious criminal gangs
trump, China wants him to win so badly
trump, Iran wants him to win so badly
trump, When we win, I'll have a deal with the red within a month, watch, because they're dying to make a deal
trump, But that last hope that Biden will win, they will own our country, China, they will own our country
trump, We made such a great deal
trump, Last week they had the largest order of corn in the history of our country, the largest single order
trump, Then they did it again
trump, You know why they're doing that Because they know I'm angry, because they know I don't care so much anymore
trump, We made a great trade deal, but I don't care
trump, But it shows you how smart they are, Doug
trump, Another with normal brain power, they'd say, Well, I'm not going to buy any more corn
trump, That's good
trump, And we'll just decouple, thank you very much
trump, But they go the opposite
trump, They buy so much, good record numbers, soybeans record numbers
trump, Last week, biggest ever, 42 of our farmers crop is now China, over the last little while
trump, You know why Because they don't want bad things to happen, that's why
trump, So they're very smart
trump, When I have every farmer in the country calling and saying, Please don't do anything
trump, They're very, very smart, but we can never forget what China did to this country and did to the world
trump, The historic achievements that I've discussed today are only a slim fraction of the extraordinary accomplishment that we've all done together in the last four years
trump, Here's just a short list of our landmarks
trump, Really they are landmarks, true landmarks
trump, We instituted a national security travel ban on the world's most dangerous regions, including jihadist regions, keeping terrorists and extremists out of our country
trump, Everyone said, Oh, that's so bad
trump, Remember when they said, Oh, that's so bad
trump, I don't think it's so bad at all
trump, We won the travel ban
trump, The fake news said we didn't because we lost in the lower court, we lost in the second court and we won in the Supreme court
trump, So they said we lost
trump, Can you believe it They said we lost Debbie, because we lost the first two, but we won in the Supreme court, so they said, They lost
trump, I guess, technically they're right, we lost when it didn't matter
trump, But we have it
trump, We have a great travel ban now for countries that are not countries where we want the people coming in
trump, Over the last three years, ICE officers have made over 380,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records, including those charged or convicted of over 145,000 assaults, 40,000 sex crimes and 5, 800 murders
trump, Over the last three years, border patrol and ICE have seized over two million pounds of fentanyl, heroin, meth, and other deadly narcotics
trump, And you see it all the time
trump, We stripped federal grant funding from deadly sanctuary cities
trump, They want to have a sanctuary city, not going to be like the old days
trump, We canceled the lawless policies of the previous administration and empowered border agents and ICE officers to do their jobs and proudly enforce the laws of the United States of America
trump, We removed 20,000 gang members, including 4,500, MS-13
trump, That's pretty good
trump, Who would ever think there's that many I entered into three landmark agreements with Honduras and El Salvador and Guatemala to end the abuse of the asylum system
trump, We cut down that payment that I was talking about substantially and they're still very happy and they are working with us very well and that includes Mexico
trump, Right now, Mexico has 27,000 of their soldiers on our Southern border, helping us to guard our Southern border
trump, And we're giving you the tools to do the job that you signed up for
trump, That's what we've done
trump, I entered into a historic partnership with Mexico, known as the migrant protection protocols, to safely return asylum seekers to Mexico, while awaiting hearings in the United States
trump, You know about that
trump, We had to have them in the United States and we captured them, we had to keep him here
trump, I said, No, no, we don't want them here
trump, We want them outside
trump, We got sued all over the place that we won
trump, So now they don't come into the United States, they can wait outside
trump, For the first time ever, the United States is now exercising our full legal authority to expedited removal
trump, We don't have to go through years and years of litigation
trump, You need Perry Mason to try and win
trump, We ended the Obama Biden policy of giving work permits to newly arriving, illegal aliens
trump, Think of that one
trump, We established the national vetting center, the most advanced visa screening system, anywhere in the world
trump, We know so much about the people coming in
trump, We know the good and we know the bad
trump, We've suspended refugee
trump, … Good and we know the bad
trump, We've suspended refugee resettlements from the world's most dangerous regions, because nothing is more important than keeping America safe
trump, To me, that's number one
trump, We've made historic progress to crack down on visa overstays
trump, You know all about that
trump, They overstay for years
trump, They say, Maybe a night, maybe two nights
trump, Well, five years later, you catch them
trump, No, we ended it
trump, We issued strict sanctions on countries that failed to take back their own criminals
trump, We have many countries beyond the four that I mentioned, the three plus one, many countries
trump, They all take them back now
trump, Before, they weren't taking them back at all
trump, The last administration simply released these criminals
trump, We're making sure they go home and we're making sure they stay home
trump, We don't want them
trump, We issued regulations to stop the horrible practice of birth tourism
trump, You know what that is, right Anchor babies, you know that, right Anchor babies
trump, Have a baby in our country and you stay for the rest of your life
trump, Congratulations
trump, You're a citizen for 90 years
trump, Then you bring in your family
trump, You bring in your family, right No
trump, No good
trump, I implemented a historic public charge regulation to finally and fully enforce the federal requirement that newcomers to our country must be financially self-sufficient, they cannot accept welfare for at least five years
trump, To protect our country and our agents during the pandemic, my administration took immediate action to ensure the safe and rapid return of all illegal aliens
trump, We brought them back
trump, We have very few in our country now
trump, We brought them back, can you believe it To protect US workers, I suspended the entry of low wage workers that threatened all of your jobs, American jobs, and we're finalizing the new H-1B regulations to permanently end the displacement of US workers
trump, In January after the China virus, after the outbreak, after the outbreak, the China virus outbreak, it came from Wuhan, right I swiftly implemented a travel ban on China and I was criticized
trump, Biden, opposed the ban
trump, He said, I oppose the ban
trump, He had no idea what the hell he was doing
trump, Why do you oppose it, Joe I don't know
trump, They told me to say that
trump, If we had listened to Sleepy Joe Biden, hundreds of thousands of additional American lives would have been lost
trump, We did a good thing
trump, That was in January, I imposed it, very early
trump, A month later, Pelosi and all these people said, Oh no, let people come in
trump, We can't
trump, We imposed it because China was heavily infected
trump, Then I imposed it in Europe also, heavily infected with Italy and France and Spain
trump, Compare our achievements with the insane and lethal policies that Biden and Bernie Sanders want
trump, The entire Biden… Harris
trump, How about her Is she a great one Is she By the way, you talk about guns
trump, She wants no 2nd Amendment
trump, She wants to raise your taxes to a level you'll be paying your government back for a long time
trump, She is not the right pick, but she was my number one draft pick
trump, They asked me that
trump, Why do you think I said, I'm very happy
trump, They thought I was happy
trump, They thought I was happy for him
trump, No, I was happy for me
trump, The Biden-Harris plan is a step by step recipe for abolishing America's borders
trump, In the Biden, Bernie manifesto, Joe Biden, promises to restore and expand catch and release across the entire US border
trump, You believe that We just got rid of it
trump, Free all illegal aliens from federal detention and close detention facilities, this would make removing illegal aliens totally impossible, and you would have murderers, killers, rapists in your midst
trump, I don't think so
trump, Immediately suspend all removals, triggering a tidal wave of, really a flood, if you think, a flood all across our border
trump, End prosecution of illegal border crosses ensuring that illegal aliens will repeatedly reenter the country over and over again and terminate all protections we have enacted against asylum fraud
trump, They want to do things that nobody thought was even possible to contemplate
trump, Now, this is all simple and I really respect because so far I've only seen about four or five people go down
trump, Because it is hot in here
trump, But I will tell you this… It's 120
trump, You know what I said before Think of yourself at a great spa, great sauna, where it's 120 degrees and we have to pay a lot of money to be there
trump, You have to pay a lot of money
trump, Getting off the border, getting off illegal protection, all of that, we are going to lower your taxes further
trump, We gave you the biggest tax decrease in the history of… The biggest tax decrease in the history of our country
trump, We decreased your taxes more than anybody has ever done and we're doing more because that's going to spell growth and that's what happened
trump, Companies are moving in like nobody has seen before
trump, So we're doing that
trump, Massive additional regulation cuts
trump, We've cut regulations more than any president in the history of our country, whether it's four years, eight years, or in one case, more
trump, I told you already, our military is the best it's ever been
trump, It's got 2
trump,5 trillion worth of new, beautiful jets and equipment and rockets and everything
trump, Hopefully, we never have to use it
trump, Our nuclear arsenal, and hopefully, hopefully we never have to even look at it, our nuclear arsenal is at a level that it's never ever been before, and we have to have it there, but we never want to use it
trump, So we have done things not only on the border, the border is one element, and to me it's very important
trump, Something that they always say about a president, the most important thing a president can do is the appointment of federal judges and supreme court justices
trump, So by the end of our, of not my, our first term, we will have appointed 300 federal judges and appeals court judges, and two supreme court justices
trump, When it comes to 2nd Amendment, when it comes to life, when it comes to a lot of things that you people live for, if you don't have the supreme court and if you don't have the courts in your side, you can forget it
trump, The next president, I think, will pick two, three, or even four justices of the supreme court
trump, They can be on the court for 40 to 50 years
trump, You pick them young
trump, They could be on there for 40 to 50 years
trump, This is going to be the most consequential presidency
trump, This is going to be the most important, and I never thought I'd say it because of what happened four years ago, this is going to be the most important election of your life
trump, So I just want to… Thank you
trump, I just want to say stay healthy, stay sharp, be careful
trump, Be very careful
trump, Go out and work like hell
trump, We need every single vote that we can get because it's probably going to be close
trump, I always assume it's going to be close
trump, They have these suppression, the fakers back there, they have the suppression polls where they interview many more Democrats than they do Republicans
trump, Doug and I were talking about it and they take out registered voters
trump, It's not registered
trump, They say, Most likely to vote voters
trump, That's what, most likely registered, they're dead, they're old, they're not going to go, they're not going to do anything
trump, Be careful with your ballots, but get out there
trump, November 3rd is the biggest date, one of the biggest dates in your life, in many cases, frankly, it's the most important date of your life
trump, One other thing we've done lot
trump, We've gotten rid of a lot of nonsense from Obama, like the Paris Accord that costs us tens of billions of dollars and gave us nothing
trump, We've gotten rid of so many different things that you have no idea, but you know what If we don't win, they can put it back, and with the things that we did put in, which are many, many, many things, many things, our military, our vets, everything, with all of the things that we put in, it's like a tree, it takes a little while to grab on
trump, You transplant it
trump, It's got to grab on
trump, If we have four more years, there's nothing that they can do
trump, Our country is sailing
trump, our country is sailing
trump, So Yuma, thank you very much
trump, Arizona, thank you very much
trump, Thank you for all your support
trump, We love you
trump, We will never ever let you down
trump, We will never let you down
trump, Governor, thank you

trump, Vote McSally
trump, Thank you everybody
