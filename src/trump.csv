QUIJANO," Good evening. From Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia, and welcome to the first, and only, vice presidential debate of 2016, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates."
KAINE," Elaine, thank you for being here tonight, and, Governor Pence, welcome. It is so great to be back at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia."
QUIJANO, Governor Pence?
PENCE," Well, first off, thank you, Elaine, and thank you to — thank you to Norwood University for their wonderful hospitality and the Commission on Presidential Debates. It’s deeply humbling for me to be here, to be surrounded by my — my wonderful family."
QUIJANO," Senator Kaine, on the campaign trail, you praised Secretary Clinton’s character, including her commitment to public service, yet 60 percent of voters don’t think she’s trustworthy. Why do so many people distrust her? Is it because they have questions about her e-mails and the Clinton Foundation?"
KAINE," Elaine, let me tell you why I trust Hillary Clinton. Here’s what people should look at as they look at a public servant. Do they have a passion in their life that showed up before they were in public life? And have they held onto that passion throughout their life, regardless of whether they were in office or not, succeeding or failing?"
QUIJANO," Governor Pence, let me ask you, you have said Donald Trump is, quote, “thoughtful, compassionate, and steady.” Yet 67 percent of voters feel he is a risky choice, and 65 percent feel he does not have the right kind of temperament to be president. Why do so many Americans think Mr. Trump is simply too erratic?"
PENCE," Well, let me — let me say first and foremost that, Senator, you and Hillary Clinton would know a lot about an insult-driven campaign. It really is remarkable. At a time when literally, in the wake of Hillary Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state, where she was the architect of the Obama administration’s foreign policy, we see entire portions of the world, particularly the wider Middle East, literally spinning out of control. I mean, the situation we’re watching hour by hour in Syria today is the result of the failed foreign policy and the weak foreign policy that Hillary Clinton helped lead in this administration and create. The newly emboldened — the aggression of Russia, whether it was in Ukraine or now their heavy-handed approach…"
KAINE, You guys love Russia. You both have said…
PENCE, … their heavy-handed approach.
KAINE, You both have said — you both have said Vladimir Putin is a better leader than the president.
PENCE, Well…[crosstalk]
QUIJANO," Well, we’re going to get to Russia in just a moment. But I do want to get back to the question at…"
PENCE," But in the midst — Elaine, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Senator, I’ll…"
KAINE, These guys have praised Vladimir Putin as a great leader. How can that…[crosstalk]
QUIJANO," Yes, and we will get to that, Senator. We do have that coming up here. But in the meantime, the questions…"
PENCE," Well, Senator, I must have hit a…[crosstalk]…I must have hit a nerve here."
QUIJANO, Why the disconnect?
PENCE," Because at a time of great challenge in the life of this nation, where we’ve weakened America’s place in the world, stifled America’s economy, the campaign of Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine has been an avalanche of insults."
KAINE, And paid few taxes and lost a billion a year.
QUIJANO, And why the disconnect with your running mate?
PENCE," But there’s a — there’s a reason why people question the trustworthiness of Hillary Clinton. And that’s because they’re paying attention. I mean, the reality is, when she was secretary of state, Senator, come on. She had a Clinton Foundation accepting contributions from foreign governments."
KAINE, You are Donald Trump’s apprentice. Let me talk about this…[crosstalk]
PENCE," Senator, I think I’m still on my time."
KAINE," Well, I think — isn’t this a discussion?"
QUIJANO, This is our open discussion.
KAINE," Yeah, let’s talk about the state of…[crosstalk]"
PENCE," Well, let me interrupt — let me interrupt you and finish my sentence, if I can."
KAINE, Finish your sentence.
PENCE, The Clinton Foundation accepted foreign contributions from foreign governments and foreign donors while she was secretary of state.
KAINE," OK, now I can weigh in. Now…"
PENCE, She had a private server…
KAINE," Now, I get to weigh in. Now, let me just say this…"
PENCE, … that was discovered…[crosstalk]
QUIJANO," … Senator, you have an opportunity to respond."
PENCE, … keep that pay to play process out of the reach of the public.
KAINE," Governor Pence — Governor Pence doesn’t think the world’s going so well and he, you know, is going to say it’s everybody’s fault."
PENCE, Do you?
KAINE," Let me tell you this. When Hillary Clinton became secretary of state, Governor Pence, do you know that Osama bin Laden was alive?"
PENCE, Yes.
KAINE," Do you know that we had 175,000 troops deployed in the battlefield in Iraq and Afghanistan? Do you know that Iran was racing toward a nuclear weapon and Russia was expanding its stockpile?"
PENCE, Eliminate the Iranian nuclear weapons program?
KAINE," Absolutely, without firing a shot. And instead of 175,000 American troops deployed overseas, we now have 15,000."
PENCE, Right and…
KAINE," These are very, very good things."
PENCE," And Iraq has been overrun by ISIS, because Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate…"
KAINE," Well, if you want to put more American troops in Iraq, you can propose that."
PENCE, Hillary Clinton — Hillary Clinton — Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement…
KAINE," No, that is incorrect. That’s incorrect."
PENCE, And so we removed — we removed all of our…
QUIJANO," Gentlemen, we’ll get to…[crosstalk]"
PENCE," … troops from Iraq, and ISIS was able to be conjured up in that vacuum."
KAINE, But I’d like to correct…
PENCE, … and overrun vast areas of Iraq.
KAINE," Governor, President Bush said we would leave Iraq at the end of 2011. And, Elaine, Iraq didn’t want our troops to stay, and they wouldn’t give us the protection for our troops. And guess what? If a nation where our troops are serving does not want us to stay, we’re not going to stay without their protection."
PENCE, It was a failure of the secretary of state…
QUIJANO," We need to move on to the next topic, gentlemen."
KAINE," If Governor Pence wants to put more troops back in Iraq, that’s…"
QUIJANO, There are a lot of people wondering in this country about the economy. Let’s turn to the issue of the economy.
KAINE, OK.
QUIJANO," According to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, neither of your economic plans will reduce the growing $19 trillion gross national debt. In fact, your plans would add even more to it."
PENCE," I think the fact that — that under this past administration of which Hillary Clinton was a part, we’ve almost doubled the national debt is atrocious. I mean, I’m very proud of the fact that — I come from a state that works. The state of Indiana has balanced budgets. We cut taxes, we’ve made record investments in education and in infrastructure, and I still finish my term with $2 billion in the bank."
QUIJANO, Senator Kaine?
KAINE," Elaine, on the economy, there’s a fundamental choice for the American electorate. Do you want a “you’re hired” president in Hillary Clinton or do you want a “you’re fired” president in Donald Trump? I think that’s not such a hard choice."
QUIJANO," On that point, Governor Pence, recently the New York Times released part of Mr. Trump’s 1995 tax return and reported that he could have avoided paying federal income taxes for years. Yesterday, Mr. Trump said he brilliantly used the laws to pay as little tax as legally possible. Does that seem fair to you?"
PENCE," Well, first, let me say, I appreciated the “you’re hired,” “you’re fired” thing, Senator. You use that a whole lot. And I think your running mate used a lot of pre-done lines."
KAINE, Fifteen million new jobs?
PENCE, … slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression.
KAINE, Fifteen million new jobs?
QUIJANO, Governor…[crosstalk]
PENCE, There are millions more people living in poverty today than the day that Barack Obama with Hillary Clinton at his side…
KAINE, And the poverty level and the median income…
PENCE, … stepped into the Oval Office.
KAINE, … improved dramatically between 2014 and 2015.
PENCE," You — honestly, Senator, you can roll out the numbers and the sunny side, but I got to tell you, people in Scranton know different. People in Fort Wayne, Indiana, know different. I mean, this economy is struggling. The answer to this economy is not more taxes."
KAINE, But it’s not the giveaway tax relief to the folks at the top.
PENCE, It’s not more spending…[crosstalk]
KAINE, I am interested to hear whether he’ll defend his running mate’s not releasing taxes and not paying taxes.
PENCE, Absolutely I will.
QUIJANO," Governor, with all due respect, the question was about whether it seems fair to you that Mr. Trump said he brilliantly used the laws to pay as little tax as legally possible."
PENCE," Well, this is probably the difference between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine. And, I mean, Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine — God bless you for it, career public servants, that’s great — Donald Trump is a businessman, not a career politician. He actually built a business."
KAINE, But why won’t he release his tax returns?
PENCE," Well, we’re answering the question about — about a business thing, is he…"
KAINE," I do want to come back to that, but…"
PENCE," His tax returns — his tax returns showed he went through a very difficult time, but he used the tax code just the way it’s supposed to be used. And he did it brilliantly."
KAINE, How do you know that? You haven’t seen his tax returns.
PENCE, He created a runway — because he’s created a business that’s worth billions of dollars today.
KAINE, How do you know that?
PENCE," And with regard to paying taxes, this whole riff about not paying taxes and people saying he didn’t pay taxes for years, Donald Trump has created tens of thousands of jobs. And he’s paid payroll taxes, sales taxes, property taxes…"
KAINE," Elaine, let me talk about something."
QUIJANO," Senator, I’m going to give you about 30 seconds to respond, and I have question on Social Security for you."
KAINE, OK.
PENCE," The only issue on taxes — Hillary Clinton is going to raise taxes, and Donald Trump and I are going to cut them."
KAINE," Donald Trump started this campaign in 2014 and he said, “If I run for president, I will absolutely release my taxes.” He’s broken his first…"
PENCE, And he will.
KAINE," He’s broken his first promise. Second, he stood on the stage…"
PENCE, He hasn’t broken his promise. He said he’s…
KAINE," He stood on the stage last week and when Hillary said, you haven’t been paying taxes, he said, “That makes me smart.” So it’s smart not to pay for our military? It’s smart not to pay for veterans? It’s smart not to pay for teachers? And I guess all of us who do pay for those things, I guess we’re stupid. And the last thing I’ll say is this…"
PENCE," Senator, do you take all the deductions that you’re entitled to?"
KAINE, The last thing — the last thing I want to ask Governor Pence is…
PENCE, I do.
KAINE, Governor Pence had to give Donald Trump his tax returns to show he was qualified to be vice president. Donald Trump must give the American public his tax returns to show that he’s qualified to be president. And he’s breaking his promise.
PENCE," Elaine, I have to respond to this."
QUIJANO," You get very little time, 20 seconds."
PENCE, I’ll be — I’ll be very respectful.
QUIJANO, Governor?
PENCE," Look, Donald Trump has filed over 100 pages of financial disclosure, which is what the law requires."
KAINE, But he said he would release his tax returns.
QUIJANO," All right, Gentlemen…"
PENCE," The American people can review that. And he’s going — Senator, he’s going to release his tax returns when the audit is over…"
QUIJANO, … I need to ask you about Social Security…
KAINE, Richard Nixon released tax returns when he was under audit.
PENCE, They’re going to raise your taxes. We’re going to cut your taxes.
QUIJANO, Gentlemen…
KAINE, If you can’t meet Nixon’s standard…
QUIJANO, The people at home cannot understand either one of you when you speak over each other. I would please ask you to wait until it is that the other is finished.
KAINE, All right. We’re having fun up here.
QUIJANO," Senator Kaine, on the issue of Social Security, in 18 years, when the Social Security Trust Funds run out of money, you’ll be 76. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates your benefits could be cut by as much as $7,500 per year. What would your administration do to prevent this cut?"
KAINE," First, we’re going to protect Social Security, which is one of the greatest programs that the American government has ever done. It happened at a time when you would work your whole life, your whole life, raising your kids, working, being a Little League coach or a Sunday school teacher, and then you would retire into poverty. And Social Security has enabled people to retire with dignity and overwhelmingly not be in poverty."
QUIJANO," Governor Pence, I’ll give you an opportunity to respond."
PENCE," Well, thanks, Elaine. There they go again. OK…"
KAINE, Go read — go read the book.
PENCE, All Donald Trump — all Donald Trump and I have said about Social Security is we’re going to meet our obligations to our seniors. That’s it.
KAINE, Go read the book.
PENCE," We’ve said we’re going to meet the obligations of Medicare. That’s what this campaign is really about, Senator. And I get, this is — this is the old scare tactic that they roll out…"
KAINE," But — but you have a voting record, Governor."
PENCE," And I get all of that. I just, look…"
KAINE, I…
PENCE, There’s a question that you asked a little bit earlier that I want to go back to.
KAINE, I can’t believe that you won’t defend your own voting record.
PENCE, I have to go back to.
QUIJANO, We…
PENCE," Well, look, I — you’re running with Hillary Clinton, who wants to raise taxes by $1 trillion, increase spending by $2 trillion, and you say you’re going to keep the promises of Social Security. Donald Trump and I are going to cut taxes. We’re going to — we’re going to — we’re going to…"
KAINE, You’re not going to cut taxes. You’re going to raise taxes on the middle class.
PENCE, … reform government programs so we can meet the obligations of Social Security and Medicare.
QUIJANO," All right. PENCE: Stay on the path that your party has us on, we’re going to be in a — in a mountain range of debt. And we’re going to face hard choices and…[crosstalk]"
KAINE," You did ask this question about debt, and the debt explosion on the Trump plan is much, much bigger than anything on the Clinton side."
QUIJANO, All right. Let me move on now…
PENCE, Three hundred and five economists said your plan is bad for the economy.
QUIJANO," … to the issue of law enforcement and race relations. Law enforcement and race relations. After the Dallas police shooting, Police Chief David Brown said, quote, “We’re asking cops to do too much in this country. Every societal failure we put it off on the cops to solve. Not enough mental health funding, not enough drug addiction funding, schools fail, let’s give it to the cops.”"
KAINE," Elaine, I think that’s a very fair comment. I think we put a lot on police shoulders. And this is something I got a lot of scar tissue and experience on."
QUIJANO, Governor Pence?
PENCE," You know, my uncle was a cop, a career cop, on the beat in downtown Chicago. He was my hero when I was growing up. And we’d go up to visit my dad’s family in Chicago. My three brothers and I would marvel at my uncle when he would come out in his uniform, sidearm at his side."
KAINE, Can I — can I explain…
PENCE," … I just think what we ought to do is we ought to stop seizing on these moments of tragedy. We ought to assure the public that we’ll have a full and complete and transparent investigation whenever there’s a loss of life because of police action. But, Senator, please, you know, enough of this seeking every opportunity to demean law enforcement broadly by making the accusation of implicit bias every time tragedy occurs."
KAINE," Elaine — Elaine, people shouldn’t be afraid to bring up issues of bias in law enforcement. And if you’re afraid to have…"
PENCE, I’m not afraid to bring that up.
KAINE," And if — if you’re afraid to have the discussion, you’ll never solve it. And so here’s — here’s an example, heartbreaking. We would agree this is a heartbreaking example."
PENCE, We need criminal justice reform.
KAINE," Well, we do."
PENCE, Indiana has passed criminal justice reform.
KAINE," But I just want to say, those who say that we should not…"
PENCE, But that’s not what you’re talking about.
KAINE," … we should not be able to bring up and talk about bias in the system, we’ll never solve the problem…"
QUIJANO, Governor Pence…[crosstalk]…Governor Pence…
PENCE," Senator, when African-American police officers involved in a police action shooting involving an African-American, why would Hillary Clinton accuse that African-American police officer of implicit bias?"
KAINE," Well, I guess I can’t believe you are defending the position that there is no bias and it’s a topic we don’t even…[crosstalk]"
QUIJANO," Governor Pence, I have a question on that point."
PENCE, I did not make that statement. I…
QUIJANO," Your fellow Republican, Governor Pence, Senator Tim Scott, who is African-American, recently spoke on the Senate floor. He said he was stopped seven times by law enforcement in one year."
KAINE, A U.S. senator.
QUIJANO," He said, “I have felt the anger, the frustration, the sadness, and the humiliation that comes with feeling like you’re being targeted for nothing more than being just yourself.” What would you say to Senator Scott about his experiences?"
PENCE," Well, I have the deepest respect for Senator Scott, and he’s a close friend. And what I would say is that we — we need to adopt criminal justice reform nationally. I — I signed criminal justice reform in the state of Indiana, Senator, and we’re very proud of it."
KAINE," Elaine, can I…"
QUIJANO," So what would you say to Senator Scott, Governor?"
PENCE," Law enforcement in this country is a force for good. They are the — they truly are people that put their lives on the line every single day. But I would — I would suggest to you, what we need to do is assert a stronger leadership at the national level to support law enforcement. You just heard Senator Kaine reject stop-and-frisk. Well, I would suggest to you that the families that live in our inner cities that are besieged by crime…"
KAINE," Elaine, let me — let me…"
QUIJANO," Governor, the question is about Senator Scott. What would — what would you tell Senator Scott?"
KAINE," Elaine, if I could — if I could jump in. I’ve heard Senator Scott make that eloquent plea. And look, criminal justice is about respecting the law and being respected by the law. So there is a fundamental respect issue here."
QUIJANO," All right. I want to turn to our next segment now, immigration. Your running mates have both said that undocumented immigrants who have committed violent crimes should be deported. What would you tell the millions of undocumented immigrants who have not committed violent crimes? Governor Pence?"
PENCE," Donald Trump’s laid out a plan to end illegal immigration once and for all in this country. We’ve been talking it to death for 20 years. Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to continue the policies of open borders, amnesty, catch and release, sanctuary cities, all the things that are driving — that are driving wages down in this country, Senator, and also too often with criminal aliens in the country, it’s bringing heartbreak."
 KAINE," These were Donald’s — hold on a second, Governor."
PENCE," It’s my time, Senator."
QUIJANO," It is, in fact, the governor’s time."
KAINE, I apologize. It’s your two minutes. I apologize.
PENCE, Thanks. I forgive you. He says ours is an insult-driven campaign. Did you all just hear that? Ours is an insult-driven campaign?
QUIJANO, Governor…
PENCE, That’s small potatoes compared to Hillary Clinton…
QUIJANO, Senator Kaine?
PENCE, …. calling half of Donald Trump’s supporters a basket of deplorables.
KAINE," Hillary Clinton said something on the campaign trail, and the very next day, she said, you know what, I shouldn’t have said that."
PENCE, She said she shouldn’t have said half.
QUIJANO," Governor, this is Senator Kaine’s two minutes, please."
KAINE," Yeah, that’s right, so now we’re even."
PENCE, Yeah. [laughter]
KAINE, Look for Donald Trump apologizing to John McCain for saying he wasn’t a hero…
PENCE, Oh…
KAINE," … to Donald Trump apologizing for calling women slobs, pigs, dogs, disgusting."
PENCE, She apologized for saying “half.”
QUIJANO," Governor. It is his two minutes, please."
KAINE, Did Donald Trump apologize for taking after somebody in a Twitter war and making fun of her weight? Did he apologize for saying African-Americans are living in Hell? Did he apologize for saying President Obama was not even a citizen of the United States? You will look in vain to see Donald Trump ever taking responsibility for anybody and apologizing.
PENCE, That’s nonsense. That’s nonsense.
KAINE, I cannot believe that Governor Pence would sit here and defend his running mate’s claim that we should create a deportation force to — so that they’ll all be gone.
PENCE," Senator, we have a deportation force. It’s called Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. And the union for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement for the first time in their history endorsed Donald Trump to be the next president of the United States of America."
KAINE, So you like the 16 million deportations?
PENCE," Senator, that’s — that’s nonsense. Look, what you just heard is they have a plan for open borders, amnesty. That’s…[crosstalk]"
KAINE, Our plan is like Ronald Reagan’s plan from 1986.
PENCE, They call it comprehensive immigration reform — they call it comprehensive immigration reform on Capitol Hill. We all know the routine. It’s amnesty. And you heard one of the last things he mentioned was border security.
KAINE," No, I…"
PENCE," They always say we’re going to do this, we’re going to do that, we’ll eventually get the border…[crosstalk]"
KAINE," … border security three years ago, and Governor Pence was against it."
QUIJANO," Governor, Mr. Trump has said…"
PENCE," Ronald Reagan said a nation without borders is not a nation. Donald Trump is committed to restoring the borders of this nation and securing our nation, enforcing our laws."
QUIJANO," So, Governor, how would these millions of undocumented immigrants leave? Would they be forcibly removed?"
PENCE," Well, I think Donald Trump laid out a series of priorities that doesn’t ends with border security. It begins with border security. And after we secure the border, not only build a wall, but beneath the ground and in the air, we do internal enforcement."
KAINE, I just have to correct Governor Pence….
PENCE, … where people can come into this country.
KAINE, I have to…
PENCE," That’s the order that you should do it. Border security, removing criminal aliens, upholding with law, and then — but then, Senator, I’ll work you when you go back to the Senate, I promise you, we’ll work with you to reform the immigration system."
KAINE," I look forward to working together in whatever capacities we serve in. But I just want to make it very, very clear that he’s trying to fuzz up what Donald Trump has said. When Donald Trump spoke in Phoenix, he looked the audience in the eye and he said, no, we’re building a wall, and we’re deporting everybody. He said, quote, “They will all be gone.” “They will all be gone.” And this is one of these ones where you can just go to the tape on it and see what Donald Trump has said. And to add…"
PENCE, He’s talking about criminal aliens.
KAINE," And to add to it, and to add to it, and to add to it, we are a nation of immigrants. Mike Pence and I both are descended from immigrant families. Some things, you know, maybe weren’t said so great about the Irish when they came, but we’ve done well by absorbing immigrants, and it’s made our nation stronger."
QUIJANO," Gentleman, I’d like to shift now to the threat of terrorism. Do you think the world today is a safer or more dangerous place than it was eight years ago? Has the terrorist threat increased or decreased? Senator Kaine?"
KAINE," The terrorist threat has decreased in some ways, because bin Laden is dead. The terrorist threat has decreased in some ways because an Iranian nuclear weapons program has been stopped. The terrorist threat to United States troops has been decreased in some ways because there’s not 175,000 in a dangerous part of the world. There’s only 15,000."
PENCE," Oh, please. Come on."
KAINE," … and Saddam Hussein. And last and most dangerously, Donald Trump believes — Donald Trump believes that the world will be safer if more nations have nuclear weapons. He’s said Saudi Arabia should get them, Japan should get them, Korea should get them. And when he was confronted with this, and told, wait a minute, terrorists could get those, proliferation could lead to nuclear war, here’s what Donald Trump said, and I quote: “Go ahead, folks, enjoy yourselves.”"
QUIJANO, Governor Pence?
PENCE, Did you work on that one a long time? Because that had a lot of really creative lines in it.
KAINE," Well, I’m going to see if you can defend any of it."
PENCE," Well, look, I can defend — I — I — I can — I can make very clear to the American people, after traveling millions of miles as our secretary of state, after being the architect of the foreign policy of this administration, America is less safe today than it was the day that Barack Obama became president of the United States. It’s absolutely inarguable."
KAINE, I was in Virginia where the Pentagon’s…[crosstalk]
PENCE, I know you were. We all lived through that day as a nation. It was heartbreaking. And I want to give this president credit for bringing Osama bin Laden to justice.
KAINE, Stopping a nuclear weapons program without firing a shot?
PENCE, You didn’t stop the nuclear weapons program.
KAINE," Yes, we did."
PENCE, You essentially…
KAINE, Even the Israeli military says it stopped.
PENCE," … guaranteed that Iran will someday become a nuclear power, because there’s no limitations once the period of time of the treaty comes off."
QUIJANO," Governor Pence, Mr. Trump has proposed extreme vetting of immigrants from parts of the world that export terrorism. But that does not address many of the recent terrorist attacks in the United States, such as the Orlando nightclub massacre and the recent bombings in New York and New Jersey. Those were homegrown, committed by U.S. citizens and legal residents. What specific tools would you use to prevent those kinds of attacks?"
PENCE," Well, I think it’s — I think it’s a great question, Elaine, but it really does begin with us reforming our immigration system and putting the interests, particularly the safety and security of the American people, first."
KAINE," Elaine, I want to…[crosstalk]"
QUIJANO," Governor, the question was about homegrown."
PENCE," Yeah, and so — but first, you know, let’s make sure we’re putting the safety and security of the American people first instead of Hillary Clinton expanding the Syrian refugee program…"
KAINE, Or instead of you violating the Constitution by blocking people based on their national origin rather than whether they’re dangerous.
PENCE, That’s not — that’s absolutely false.
KAINE," That’s what the Seventh Circuit decided just — here’s the difference, Elaine."
PENCE, The Seventh Circuit…
KAINE," We have different views on — on refugee issues and on immigration. Hillary and I want to do enforcement based on, are people dangerous? These guys say all Mexicans are bad."
PENCE, That’s absolutely false.
KAINE," And with respect to refugees, we want to keep people out if they’re dangerous. Donald Trump said keep them out if they’re Muslim. Mike Pence…"
PENCE, Absolutely…
KAINE, … put a program in place to keep them out if they’re from Syria. And yesterday an appellate court with three Republican judges struck down the Pence plan…
PENCE, Right. Right.
KAINE, … and said it was discriminatory…
PENCE, And those judges — those judges said…
KAINE," We should focus upon danger, not upon discrimination."
QUIJANO, Governor?
PENCE," Elaine, to your point, those judges said it was because there wasn’t any evidence yet that — that ISIS had infiltrated the United States. Well, Germany just arrested three Syrian refugees that were connected to ISIS."
KAINE, But they told you there’s a right way and a wrong way to do it.
PENCE," But, look, if you’re going to be critical of me on that, that’s fair game. I will tell you, after two Syrian refugees were involved in the attack in Paris that is called Paris’ 9/11, as governor of the state of Indiana, I have no higher priority than the safety and security of the people of my state."
KAINE," But, Governor Pence…"
PENCE, So you bet I suspended that program.
KAINE," But, Governor Pence, I just…"
PENCE," And I stand by that decision. And if I’m vice president of the United States or Donald Trump is president, we’re going to put the safety and security of the American people first."
KAINE, Sure. Can we just be clear — Hillary and I will do immigration enforcement and we’ll vet refugees based on whether they’re dangerous or not. We won’t do it based on discriminating against you from the country you come from or the religion that you practice.
PENCE, But the problem with that…
KAINE, That is completely antithetical to the Jeffersonian values of…[crosstalk]
PENCE," Elaine, the director of the FBI, our homeland security, said we can’t know for certain who these people are coming from Syria."
KAINE," Yes, we can, and when we don’t let them know, we don’t let them in."
PENCE, So — the FBI…
KAINE," When we don’t know who they are, we don’t let them in."
PENCE," The FBI and homeland security said we can’t know for certain. You’ve got to err on the side of the safety and security of the American people, Senator. I understand the…"
KAINE, By trashing all Syrians or trashing all Muslims?
PENCE, … the U.N. wants us to expand the Syrian refugee program…
QUIJANO," Senator Kaine, let me ask you this. Secretary Clinton…"
PENCE, We’re going to put the safety and security of the American people first.
QUIJANO, … has talked about an intelligence surge.
KAINE, Yes.
QUIJANO, What exactly would an intelligence surge look like? And how would that help identify terrorists with no operational connection to a foreign terrorist organization?
KAINE," Intelligence surge is two things, Elaine. It’s two things. It’s, first, dramatically expanding our intelligence capacities by hiring great professionals, but also we’ve got some of the best intel and cyber employees in the world right here in the United States working for many of our private sector companies."
PENCE," That’s not his plan. KAINE: Well, he said NATO is obsolete. And, look, if you put aside — push aside your alliances, who you’re going to share intelligence with? Hillary Clinton is the secretary of state who knows how to build alliances. She built the sanctions regime around the world that stopped the Iranian nuclear weapons program. And that’s what an intelligence surge means. Better skill and capacity, but also better alliances."
QUIJANO, All right. I’d like to turn now to the tragedy in Syria. Two hundred fifty thousand…
PENCE, Can I speak about the cybersecurity surge at all?
QUIJANO," You can — you can have 30 seconds, Governor, quickly, please."
PENCE," First, Donald Trump just spoke about this issue this week. We have got to bring together the best resources of this country to understand that cyber warfare is the new warfare of the asymmetrical enemies that we face in this country. And I look forward if I’m privileged to be in this role of working with you in the Senate to make sure that we resource that effort."
KAINE, We will work together in whatever roles we inhabit.
PENCE," We have an intelligence, sir. But I will also tell you that it’s important in this moment to remember that Hillary Clinton had a private server in her home that had classified information on it…"
QUIJANO, And I don’t — 30 seconds is on up.
PENCE," … about drone strikes, e-mails from the president of the United States of America were on there."
QUIJANO, Right.
PENCE, Her private server was subject to being hacked by foreign…[crosstalk]
QUIJANO," I’d like to ask you about Syria, Governor."
PENCE, We could put cybersecurity first if we just make sure the next secretary of state doesn’t have a private server.
KAINE, A full investigation concluded that not one reasonable prosecutor would take any additional step. You don’t get to decide the rights and wrongs of this. We have a justice system that does that. And a Republican FBI director did an investigation and concluded that…[crosstalk]
QUIJANO," All right, we are moving on now. Two hundred fifty thousand people…"
PENCE, If your son or my son handled classified information the way Hillary Clinton did…
QUIJANO, … one hundred thousand of them children — Governor…
PENCE, … they’d be court martialed.
KAINE, That is absolutely false and you know that.
PENCE, Absolutely true.
KAINE," And you know that, Governor."
QUIJANO, Governor…
PENCE, It’s absolutely true.
QUIJANO," Gentlemen, please."
KAINE, Because the FBI did an investigation.
QUIJANO, Gentlemen.
KAINE, And they concluded that there was no reasonable prosecutor who would take it further. Sorry.
QUIJANO," Senator Kaine, Governor Pence, please."
KAINE, Syria.
QUIJANO," I want to turn now to Syria. Two hundred fifty thousand people, 100,000 of them children, are under siege in Aleppo, Syria. Bunker buster bombs, cluster munitions, and incendiary weapons are being dropped on them by Russian and Syrian militaries. Does the U.S. have a responsibility to protect civilians and prevent mass casualties on this scale, Governor Pence?"
PENCE," The United States of America needs to begin to exercise strong leadership to protect the vulnerable citizens and over 100,000 children in Aleppo. Hillary Clinton’s top priority when she became secretary of state was the Russian reset, the Russian reset. After the Russian reset, the Russians invaded Ukraine and took over Crimea."
QUIJANO," Governor, your two minutes are up."
PENCE," We’ve just got to have American strength on the world stage. When Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, the Russians and other countries in the world will know they’re dealing with a strong American president."
QUIJANO, Senator Kaine?
KAINE," Hillary and I also agree that the establishment of humanitarian zones in northern Syria with the provision of international human aid, consistent with the U.N. Security Council resolution that was passed in February 2014, would be a very, very good idea."
PENCE," Well, that offended me."
KAINE," Governor Pence just said — Governor Pence just said that Donald Trump will rebuild the military. No, he won’t. Donald Trump is avoiding paying taxes. The New York Times story — and we need to get this — but the New York Times suggested that he probably didn’t pay taxes for about 18 years starting in 1995. Those years included the years of 9/11."
QUIJANO," The question was about Aleppo, Senator."
KAINE," He wouldn’t support troops. He wouldn’t — he wouldn’t support — this is important, Elaine. When a guy running for president will not support the troops, not support veterans, not support teachers, that’s really important."
QUIJANO, Right.
KAINE," And I said about Aleppo, we do agree the notion is we have to create a humanitarian zone in northern Syria. It’s very important."
QUIJANO," Governor Pence, you had mentioned a no-fly zone. Where would you propose setting up a safe zone specifically? How would you keep it safe?"
PENCE," Well, first and foremost, Donald Trump supports our troops. Donald Trump supports our veterans."
KAINE, He won’t pay taxes.
PENCE, Donald Trump has paid all the taxes that he’s — do you not take deductions? How does that work?
QUIJANO," Gentlemen, this is about Syria. I’d like to…[crosstalk]"
PENCE," Honestly, Senator. Honestly, Senator."
KAINE, It is about our troops. It is about our troops.
PENCE, I understand why you want to change — I understand why you want to change the subject.
KAINE, How can you support the troops if you won’t pay taxes?
PENCE, I understand why you want to change the subject. And let me be very clear on this Russian thing. The larger question here…
KAINE, Do you think Donald Trump is smart to not pay taxes?
QUIJANO," Gentlemen, we’re going to have time to get to Russia here."
PENCE," What we’re dealing with is the — you know, there’s an old proverb that says the Russian bear never dies, it just hibernates. And the truth of the matter is, the weak and feckless foreign policy of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama has awakened an aggression in Russia that first appeared a few years ago with their move in Georgia, now their move into Crimea, now their move into the wider Middle East."
QUIJANO, And exactly how would those safe zones work? How would they remain safe?
PENCE," The — the safe zones would have to be — as the senator said, there’s already a framework for this that’s been recognized by the international community. The United States of America needs to be prepared to work with our allies in the region to create a route for safe passage and then to protect people in those areas, including with a no-fly zone."
KAINE," Well, let me — let me come back…"
PENCE, … is deeply troubling to me. That will all change the day Donald Trump becomes president of the United States.
KAINE," … and talk about — let me talk about the things that Governor Pence doesn’t want to acknowledge, Elaine. He doesn’t want to acknowledge that we stopped the Iranian nuclear weapons program. He doesn’t want to acknowledge…"
PENCE, You didn’t.
KAINE, … that Hillary was part of the team that got bin Laden. He doesn’t want to acknowledge…
PENCE, I just did.
KAINE," … that it’s a good thing, not a bad thing, that it’s a good thing — not a bad thing — that we’re down from 175,000 troops deployed overseas to 15,000."
PENCE," And come on. Senator. Senator, that was even beneath you and Hillary Clinton. And that — that’s pretty low."
KAINE, But do you — do you think — do you think we should have — more nuclear weapons in the world will make us safer?
PENCE," Senator, the…"
KAINE, That’s what Donald Trump thinks.
PENCE, Ronald Reagan also said nuclear war should never be fought because it can never be won. And the United States of America needs to make investments in modernizing our nuclear force for both deterrence…
KAINE, But can you defend Donald Trump’s claim that more nations should get nuclear weapons?
PENCE," … and assurance to our allies. But let me go back to this Iran thing. I mean, he keeps saying that they prevented — that Hillary Clinton started the deal with the Iranians prevented Iran from getting a nuclear weapon."
KAINE, That’s what the Israeli joint chiefs of staff is saying right now.
PENCE," Well, that’s not what — that’s not what Israel thinks."
KAINE," Gadi Eizenkot, you can go check it."
PENCE, You wouldn’t necessarily know that.
KAINE, Go to the tape.
PENCE, I know you boycotted Prime Minister Netanyahu’s speech when he came before the Congress.
KAINE," No, I visited him in his office. I visited him in his office."
PENCE," You boycotted the speech. The point is, what this Iran — so-called Iran deal did was essentially guarantee — I mean, when I was in Congress, I fought hard on a bipartisan basis with Republican and Democrat members to move forward the toughest sanctions, it — literally in the history of the United States, against Iran."
KAINE, And then Hillary used them to get a deal.
PENCE," We were bringing them to heel, but the goal was always that we would only lift the sanctions if Iran permanently renounced their nuclear ambitions."
KAINE," Elaine, let me just mention one thing."
PENCE," They have not — Elaine, let me finish a sentence. They have not renounced their nuclear ambitions. And when the deal’s period runs out, there’s no limitation on them obtaining weapons. That…[crosstalk]"
QUIJANO," And very quickly, Senator."
KAINE, Elaine…
PENCE, … and the fact that they got $1.7 billion in a ransom payment…
QUIJANO," We need to talk about Russia. Very quickly, though, Senator, please."
PENCE, … is astonishing to the American people.
KAINE," Six times tonight, I have said to Governor Pence I can’t imagine how you can defend your running mate’s position on one issue after the next. And in all six cases, he’s refused to defend his running mate."
PENCE," Well, let’s — no, no, don’t put words in my mouth."
QUIJANO, All right.
PENCE, He’s going…[crosstalk]
KAINE, And yet he is asking everybody to vote for somebody that he cannot defend. And I just think that should be underlined.
PENCE," No, I’m — look…[crosstalk]"
QUIJANO," All right, gentlemen, let’s talk about Russia. This is a topic that has come up."
PENCE," I’m very, very happy to defend Donald Trump. If he wants to take these one at a time, I’ll take them one at a time."
QUIJANO, I will give you an opportunity to do that.
KAINE, More nations should get nuclear weapons. Try to defend that.
PENCE," Don’t put words in my mouth. Well, he never said that, Senator."
KAINE," He absolutely said it. Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Japan."
PENCE," Most of the stuff you’ve said, he’s never said."
QUIJANO," Gentlemen, Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, annexed Crimea, and has provided crucial military support to the Assad regime. What steps, if any, would your administration take to counter these actions? Senator Kaine?"
KAINE, You’ve got to be tough on Russia. So let’s start with not praising Vladimir Putin as a great leader. Donald Trump and Mike Pence have said he’s a great leader. And Donald Trump has business…
PENCE," No, we haven’t."
KAINE, … has business dealings — has business dealings with Russia that he refuses to disclose. Hillary Clinton has gone toe-to-toe with Russia. She went toe-to-toe with Russia as secretary of state to do the New START Agreement to reduce Russia’s nuclear stockpile. She’s had the experience doing it.
PENCE," Oh, that’s nonsense."
KAINE," He was on a TV show a couple months back, and he said, “I’ll guarantee you this, Russia’s not going into the Ukraine.” And he had to be reminded that they had gone into the Crimea two years before."
PENCE, He knew that.
KAINE," Hillary Clinton has gone toe-to-toe with Russia to work out a deal on New START. She got them engaged in a meaningful way to cap Iran’s nuclear weapons program. And yet she stood up to them on issues such as Syria and their invasion of Georgia. You’ve got to have the ability to do that, and Hillary does."
PENCE, But what’s it got to do with Russia?
KAINE," Every president since Richard Nixon has done it, and Donald Trump has said I’m doing business with Russia. The only way the American public will see whether he has a conflict of interest…"
PENCE," No, he hasn’t said that."
KAINE," He has, actually."
QUIJANO," Senator, your time is up. Governor?"
PENCE," Well, thanks. I’m just trying to keep up with the insult-driven campaign on the other side of the table."
KAINE," You know, I’m just saying facts about your running mate."
PENCE, Yeah.
KAINE, And I know you can’t defend.
QUIJANO," Senator, please. This is the governor’s two minutes."
PENCE," I’m happy to defend him, Senator. Don’t put words in my mouth that I’m not defending him."
KAINE, You’re not.
PENCE," I’m happy to defend him. Most of what you said is completely false, and the American people know that."
KAINE, I’ll run through the list of things where you won’t defend…
PENCE, This isn’t the old days where you can just say stuff and people believe it.
QUIJANO," Senator, please. This is Governor Pence’s two minutes."
PENCE," Look, this is the alternative universe of Washington, D.C., versus reality. Hillary Clinton said her number-one priority was a reset with Russia. That reset resulted in the invasion of Ukraine, after they’d infiltrated with what are called little green men, Russian soldiers that were dressing up like Ukrainian dissidents, and then they moved all the way into Crimea, took over the Crimean Peninsula. Donald Trump knew that happened. He basically was saying it’s not going to happen again. The truth of the matter is that what you have in the rise of aggressive Russia, which has had — increased its influence in Iran, that’s now — now because of this deal is on a pathway in the future to obtain a nuclear — the leading state sponsor of terror in the world in Iran now has a closer working relationship with Russia because of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama’s foreign policy and $150 billion and sanctions all being lifted."
KAINE, We wiped out the leader of Al Qaida.
PENCE, … on the day that Iran released four American hostages…
KAINE, We stopped Iran from getting nuclear weapons.
QUIJANO, Governor…
PENCE, … we delivered $400 million in cash as a ransom payment for Americans held by the radical mullahs in Tehran.
QUIJANO," Governor, yesterday, Mr. Trump said…"
KAINE, And we stopped a nuclear weapons program without a shot.
QUIJANO," … quote, “Putin has no respect for Hillary Clinton and no respect for Obama.” Why do you think he’ll respect a Trump-Pence administration?"
PENCE, Strength. Plain and simple.
KAINE, Business dealings.
PENCE, Donald Trump — that’s nonsense. Donald Trump is a strong leader…
KAINE, Donald Trump’s son says that the Trump organization…
PENCE, … who is going to lead with American strength.
QUIJANO," Please, Senator, I’ll give you a chance to respond."
PENCE," We’re going to rebuild our military. And let me — let me — this whole Putin thing. Look, America is stronger than Russia. Our economy is 16 times larger than the Russian economy. America’s political system is superior to the crony, corrupt capitalist system in Russia in every way."
QUIJANO, Senator Kaine?
PENCE, … of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.
KAINE," Well, this is one where we can just kind of go to the tape on it. But Governor Pence said, inarguably, Vladimir Putin is a better leader than President Obama."
PENCE, That is absolutely inaccurate.
KAINE, And — and — and I just think a guy who praises…
PENCE, He said he’s stronger — he’s been stronger on the world stage.
KAINE," No, he said leader. And if — and I’ll just say this, Governor."
PENCE, You just said better.
KAINE," If you mistake leadership for dictatorship, and you can’t tell the difference, a country that’s running its economy into the ground…"
PENCE," Yeah, here we go. This is the grade school thing again?"
KAINE, … persecuting journalists…
PENCE," Right, this is grade school."
KAINE," … if you can’t tell the difference, you shouldn’t be commander-in-chief."
PENCE, Yeah.
KAINE," And with Donald Trump — Donald Trump’s sons say that they have all these business dealings with Russia. Those could be disclosed with tax returns, but they refuse to do them. Americans need to worry about whether Donald Trump will be watching out for America’s bottom line or his own bottom line."
QUIJANO," Senator Kaine, what went wrong with the Russia reset?"
KAINE, Vladimir Putin. Vladimir Putin is a dictator.
QUIJANO, And what would do you differently?
KAINE," Vladimir Putin is a dictator. He’s not a leader. Anybody who thinks otherwise doesn’t know Russian history and they don’t know Vladimir Putin. Hillary Clinton knows exactly who this guy is. John McCain said, I look in his eyes and I see KGB. And Hillary kind of has that same feeling."
PENCE, Right.
KAINE, So how do deal with him? You’ve got to — we do have to deal with Russia in a lot of different ways. There are areas where we can cooperate. So it was Hillary Clinton who worked with Russia on the New START Treaty to reduce their nuclear weapons stockpile. It was Hillary Clinton that worked with Russia to get them engaged in a community of nations to stop the Iranian nuclear weapons program without firing a shot.
QUIJANO," All right, I’d like to ask now about North Korea, Iran and the threat of nuclear weapons. North Korea recently conducted its fifth and most powerful nuclear test."
PENCE, Right.
QUIJANO, What specific steps would you take to prevent North Korea from developing a nuclear-armed missile capable of reaching the United States? Governor Pence?
PENCE," Well, first, we need to — we need to make a commitment to rebuild our military, including modernizing our nuclear forces. And we also need — we also need an effective American diplomacy that will marshal the resources of nations in the Asian Pacific Rim to put pressure on North Korea, on Kim Jong-un, to abandon his nuclear ambitions. It has to remain the policy of the United States of America the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, plain and simple."
KAINE, Until he…[crosstalk]
PENCE," … done well in some focus group. But here — Hillary Clinton and her husband set up a private foundation called the Clinton Foundation. While she was secretary of state, the Clinton Foundation accepted tens of millions of dollars from foreign governments and foreign donors."
QUIJANO," Governor, your two minutes are up."
PENCE, … the reason the American people don’t trust Hillary Clinton is because they are looking at the pay to play politics that she operated with the Clinton Foundation through a private server…
QUIJANO," Governor, please."
PENCE, … while she’s secretary of state.
QUIJANO," Your two minutes are up, Governor."
PENCE, And they’re saying enough is enough.
QUIJANO, Senator Kaine?
KAINE," I’m going to talk about the foundation, and then I’ll talk about North Korea. So, on the foundation. I am glad to talk about the foundation. The Clinton Foundation is one of the highest- rated charities in the world. It provides AIDS drugs to about 11.5 million people. It helps Americans deal with opioid overdoses. It gets higher rankings for its charity than the American Red Cross does. The Clinton Foundation does an awful lot of good work."
PENCE, The Trump Foundation is a non-profit.
KAINE," In addition, Donald Trump has a foundation. The foundation was just fined for illegally contributing foundation dollars to a political campaign of a Florida attorney general. They made an illegal contribution, and then they tried to hide it by disguising it to somebody else. And the person they donated to was somebody whose office was charged with investigating Trump University."
QUIJANO," Governor, I will give you 30 seconds to respond, because I know you want to, but, again, I would remind you both this was about North Korea. [laughter]"
PENCE," Well, thank you. Thank you. The Trump Foundation is a private family foundation. They give virtually every cent in the Trump Foundation to charitable causes."
KAINE, Political contributions?
PENCE, Less than ten cents on the dollar in the Clinton Foundation has gone to charitable causes.
KAINE," A $20,000 portrait of Donald Trump? PENCE: Less than 10 cents on the dollar of the Clinton Foundation has gone to charitable causes."
KAINE, Ninety percent.
PENCE," It has been a platform for the Clintons to travel the world, to have staff. But honestly, Senator, we would know a lot more about it if Hillary Clinton would just turn over the 33,000 e-mails…"
QUIJANO," All right, let’s turn back to North Korea…"
PENCE, … that she refused to turn over in her private server…
QUIJANO, Senator Kaine…
PENCE, … and we’d have a much better picture of what the Clinton Foundation was about.
QUIJANO," Senator Kaine, if you had intelligence that North Korea was about to launch a missile, a nuclear-armed missile capable of reaching the United States, would you take preemptive action?"
KAINE," If we — look, a president should take action to defend the United States against imminent threat. You have to. A president has to do that. Now exactly what action, you would have to determine what your intelligence was, how certain you were of that intelligence, but you would have to take action."
QUIJANO," All right. I’d like to turn to our next segment now. And in this, I’d like to focus on social issues. You have both been open about the role that faith has played in your lives. Can you discuss in detail a time when you struggled to balance your personal faith and a public policy position? Senator Kaine?"
KAINE," Yeah, that’s an easy one for me, Elaine. It’s an easy one. I’m really fortunate. I grew up in a wonderful household with great Irish Catholic parents. My mom and dad are sitting right here. I was educated by Jesuits at Rockhurst High School in Kansas City. My 40th reunion is in 10 days."
QUIJANO, Governor Pence?
PENCE," Well, it’s a wonderful question. And my Christian faith is at the very heart of who I am. I was also raised in a wonderful family of faith. It was a church on Sunday morning and grace before dinner."
KAINE, That’s shared.
PENCE," But for me, I would tell you that for me the sanctity of life proceeds out of the belief that — that ancient principle that — where God says before you were formed in the womb, I knew you, and so for my first time in public life, I sought to stand with great compassion for the sanctity of life."
KAINE," Elaine, this is a fundamental question, a fundamental question. Hillary and I are both people out of religious backgrounds, from Methodist church experience, which was really formative for her as a public servant."
PENCE," No, it’s really not. Donald Trump and I would never support legislation that punished women who made the heartbreaking choice to end a pregnancy."
KAINE, Then why did Donald Trump say that?
PENCE, We just never would.
KAINE, Why did he say that?
PENCE," Well, look, it’s — look, he’s not a polished politician like you and Hillary Clinton. And so…"
KAINE," Well, I would admit that’s not a polished…[crosstalk]"
PENCE," You know, things don’t always come out exactly the way he means them."
KAINE," Well, can I say…"
PENCE, But I’m telling you what the policy of our administration would be.
KAINE," Great line from the — great line from the gospel of Matthew. From the fullness of the heart, the mouth speaks."
PENCE, Yeah.
KAINE, When Donald Trump says women should be punished or Mexicans are rapists and criminals…
PENCE, I’m telling you…
KAINE," … or John McCain is not a hero, he is showing you who he is."
PENCE," Senator, you’ve whipped out that Mexican thing again. He — look…"
KAINE, Can you defend it?
PENCE," There are criminal aliens in this country, Tim, who have come into this country illegally who are perpetrating violence and taking American lives."
KAINE, You want to — you want to use a big broad brush against Mexicans on that?
PENCE," He also said and many of them are good people. You keep leaving that out of your quote. And if you want me to go there, I’ll go there."
KAINE, This is important —
PENCE, … bring the — let’s welcome the children into our world. There are so many families around the country who can’t have children. We could improve adoption…
KAINE," But, Governor…"
PENCE, … so that families that can’t have children can adopt more readily those children from crisis pregnancies.
KAINE," Governor, why don’t you trust women to make this choice for themselves? We can encourage people to support life. Of course we can. But why don’t you trust women? Why doesn’t Donald Trump trust women to make this choice for themselves?"
PENCE, Because there are…
KAINE," … but on fundamental issues of morality, we should let women make their own decisions."
PENCE," Because there is — a society can be judged by how it deals with its most vulnerable, the aged, the infirm, the disabled, and the unborn. I believe it with all my heart. And I couldn’t be more proud to be standing with a pro-life candidate in Donald Trump."
QUIJANO," I do have one final question for you both tonight. It has been a divisive campaign. Senator Kaine, if your ticket wins, what specifically are you going to do to unify the country and reassure the people who voted against you?"
KAINE," That’s a really important one. That may be the $64,000 question, because it has been a divisive campaign. And again, Hillary is running a campaign about stronger together, and Donald Trump — and this is — this is not directed at this man, except to the extent that he can’t defend Donald Trump — Donald Trump has run a campaign that’s been about one insult after the next."
QUIJANO," Governor, how will you unify the country if you win?"
PENCE," Well, thank you, Elaine, and thanks for a great discussion…"
KAINE, Absolutely.
PENCE," … tonight. Thank you, Senator."
QUIJANO," All right, gentlemen, thank you so much."
QUIJANO," Good evening. From Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia, and welcome to the first, and only, vice presidential debate of 2016, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates."
WALLACE," Good evening from the Thomas and Mack Center at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. I’m Chris Wallace of Fox News, and I welcome you to the third and final of the 2016 presidential debates between Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump."
CLINTON," Thank you very much, Chris. And thanks to UNLV for hosting us."
WALLACE," Secretary Clinton, thank you."
TRUMP," Well, first of all, it’s great to be with you, and thank you, everybody. The Supreme Court: It’s what it’s all about. Our country is so, so—it’s just so imperative that we have the right justices."
WALLACE," Mr. Trump, thank you."
CLINTON," Well, first of all, I support the Second Amendment. I lived in Arkansas for 18 wonderful years. I represented upstate New York. I understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership. It goes back to the founding of our country."
WALLACE," Let me bring Mr. Trump in here. The bipartisan Open Debate Coalition got millions of votes on questions to ask here, and this was, in fact, one of the top questions that they got. How will you ensure the Second Amendment is protected? You just heard Secretary Clinton’s answer. Does she persuade you that, while you may disagree on regulation, that, in fact, she supports a Second Amendment right to bear arms?"
TRUMP," Well, the D.C. vs. Heller decision was very strongly—and she was extremely angry about it. I watched. I mean, she was very, very angry when upheld. And Justice Scalia was so involved. And it was a well-crafted decision. But Hillary was extremely upset, extremely angry. And people that believe in the Second Amendment and believe in it very strongly were very upset with what she had to say."
WALLACE," Well, let me bring in Secretary Clinton. Were you extremely upset?"
CLINTON," Well, I was upset because, unfortunately, dozens of toddlers injure themselves, even kill people with guns, because, unfortunately, not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions."
WALLACE," Let me bring Mr. Trump back into this, because, in fact, you oppose any limits on assault weapons, any limits on high-capacity magazines. You support a national right to carry law. Why, sir?"
TRUMP," Well, let me just tell you before we go any further. In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city. So we have the toughest laws, and you have tremendous gun violence."
WALLACE," Well, let’s pick up on another issue which divides you and the justices that whoever ends up winning this election appoints could have a dramatic effect there, and that’s the issue of abortion."
TRUMP, Right.
WALLACE," Mr. Trump, you’re pro-life. But I want to ask you specifically: Do you want the court, including the justices that you will name, to overturn Roe v. Wade, which includes—in fact, states—a woman’s right to abortion?"
TRUMP," Well, if that would happen, because I am pro-life, and I will be appointing pro-life judges, I would think that that will go back to the individual states."
WALLACE, But I’m asking you specifically. Would you like to…
TRUMP," If they overturned it, it will go back to the states."
WALLACE," But what I’m asking you, sir, is, do you want to see the court overturn—you just said you want to see the court protect the Second Amendment. Do you want to see the court overturn Roe v. Wade?"
TRUMP," Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justices on, that’s really what’s going to be—that will happen. And that’ll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court. I will say this: It will go back to the states, and the states will then make a determination."
WALLACE, Secretary Clinton?
CLINTON," Well, I strongly support Roe v. Wade, which guarantees a constitutional right to a woman to make the most intimate, most difficult, in many cases, decisions about her health care that one can imagine. And in this case, it’s not only about Roe v. Wade. It is about what’s happening right now in America."
WALLACE, Secretary Clinton…
CLINTON," And we have come too far to have that turned back now. And, indeed, he said women should be punished, that there should be some form of punishment for women who obtain abortions. And I could just not be more opposed to that kind of thinking."
WALLACE," I’m going to give you a chance to respond, but I want to ask you, Secretary Clinton, I want to explore how far you believe the right to abortion goes. You have been quoted as saying that the fetus has no constitutional rights. You also voted against a ban on late-term, partial-birth abortions. Why?"
CLINTON," Because Roe v. Wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account. And when I voted as a senator, I did not think that that was the case."
WALLACE," Mr. Trump, your reaction? And particularly on this issue of late-term, partial-birth abortions."
TRUMP," Well, I think it’s terrible. If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby."
CLINTON," Well, that is not what happens in these cases. And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate. You should meet with some of the women that I have met with, women I have known over the course of my life. This is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make. And I do not believe the government should be making it."
WALLACE," All right. But just briefly, I want to move on to another segment…"
TRUMP," And, honestly, nobody has business doing what I just said, doing that, as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth. Nobody has that."
WALLACE," All right. Let’s move on to the subject of immigration. And there is almost no issue that separates the two of you more than the issue of immigration. Actually, there are a lot of issues that separate the two of you."
TRUMP," Well, first of all, she wants to give amnesty, which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people that are waiting in line for many, many years. We need strong borders."
WALLACE," Mr. Trump, thank you. Same question to you, Secretary Clinton. Basically, why are you right and Mr. Trump is wrong?"
CLINTON," Well, as he was talking, I was thinking about a young girl I met here in Las Vegas, Carla, who is very worried that her parents might be deported, because she was born in this country but they were not. They work hard, they do everything they can to give her a good life."
WALLACE," Thank you, Secretary Clinton. I want to follow up…"
TRUMP," Chris, I think it’s…"
WALLACE, OK.
TRUMP," I think I should respond to that. First of all, I had a very good meeting with the president of Mexico. Very nice man. We will be doing very much better with Mexico on trade deals. Believe me. The NAFTA deal signed by her husband is one of the worst deals ever made of any kind, signed by anybody. It’s a disaster."
WALLACE," Well, let me—wait, wait, sir, let me…"
TRUMP, We are a country of laws. We either have—and by the way…
WALLACE," Now, wait. I’d like to hear from…"
TRUMP," Well—well, but she said one thing."
WALLACE, I’d like to hear—I’d like to hear from Secretary Clinton.
CLINTON," I voted for border security, and there are…"
TRUMP, And the wall.
CLINTON, There are some limited places where that was appropriate. There also is necessarily going to be new technology and how best to deploy that.
WALLACE, Mr. Trump?
TRUMP," President Obama has moved millions of people out. Nobody knows about it, nobody talks about it. But under Obama, millions of people have been moved out of this country. They’ve been deported. She doesn’t want to say that, but that’s what’s happened, and that’s what happened big league."
WALLACE, I want to…
TRUMP, But what she doesn’t say is that President Obama has deported millions and millions of people just the way it is.
WALLACE," Secretary Clinton, I want to…"
CLINTON, We will not have open borders. That is…
WALLACE," Well, let me—Secretary…"
CLINTON, That is a rank mischaracterization.
WALLACE, Secretary Clinton…
CLINTON," We will have secure borders, but we’ll also have reform. And this used to be a bipartisan issue. Ronald Reagan was the last president…"
WALLACE," Secretary Clinton, excuse me. Secretary Clinton."
CLINTON," … to sign immigration reform, and George W. Bush supported it, as well."
WALLACE," Secretary Clinton, I want to clear up your position on this issue, because in a speech you gave to a Brazilian bank, for which you were paid $225,000, we’ve learned from the WikiLeaks, that you said this, and I want to quote. “My dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders.” So that’s the question…"
TRUMP, Thank you.
WALLACE," That’s the question. Please quiet, everybody. Is that your dream, open borders?"
CLINTON," Well, if you went on to read the rest of the sentence, I was talking about energy. You know, we trade more energy with our neighbors than we trade with the rest of the world combined. And I do want us to have an electric grid, an energy system that crosses borders. I think that would be a great benefit to us."
WALLACE, Well?
TRUMP," That was a great pivot off the fact that she wants open borders, OK? How did we get on to Putin?"
WALLACE," Hold on—hold on, wait. Hold on, folks. Because we—this is going to end up getting out of control. Let’s try to keep it quiet so—for the candidates and for the American people."
TRUMP, So just to finish on the borders…
WALLACE, Yes?
TRUMP," She wants open borders. People are going to pour into our country. People are going to come in from Syria. She wants 550 percent more people than Barack Obama, and he has thousands and thousands of people. They have no idea where they come from."
WALLACE," Wait, but…"
TRUMP," … from everything I see, has no respect for this person."
CLINTON," Well, that’s because he’d rather have a puppet as president of the United States."
TRUMP, No puppet. No puppet.
CLINTON, And it’s pretty clear…
TRUMP, You’re the puppet!
CLINTON, It’s pretty clear you won’t admit…
TRUMP," No, you’re the puppet."
CLINTON," … that the Russians have engaged in cyberattacks against the United States of America, that you encouraged espionage against our people, that you are willing to spout the Putin line, sign up for his wish list, break up NATO, do whatever he wants to do, and that you continue to get help from him, because he has a very clear favorite in this race."
WALLACE, Secretary Clinton…
CLINTON, And I think it’s time you take a stand…
TRUMP," She has no idea whether it’s Russia, China, or anybody else."
CLINTON, I am not quoting myself.
TRUMP, She has no idea.
CLINTON, I am quoting 17…
TRUMP," Hillary, you have no idea."
CLINTON, … 17 intelligence—do you doubt 17 military and civilian…
TRUMP, And our country has no idea.
CLINTON, … agencies.
TRUMP," Yeah, I doubt it. I doubt it."
CLINTON," Well, he’d rather believe Vladimir Putin than the military and civilian intelligence professionals who are sworn to protect us. I find that just absolutely…[crosstalk]"
TRUMP, She doesn’t like Putin because Putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way.
WALLACE, Mr. Trump…
TRUMP, Excuse me. Putin has outsmarted her in Syria.
WALLACE, Mr. Trump…[crosstalk]
TRUMP, He’s outsmarted her every step of the way.
WALLACE," I’m not a potted plant here, I do get to ask some questions."
TRUMP," Yes, that’s fine."
WALLACE," And I would like to ask you this direct question. The top national security officials of this country do believe that Russia has been behind these hacks. Even if you don’t know for sure whether they are, do you condemn any interference by Russia in the American election?"
TRUMP, By Russia or anybody else.
WALLACE, You condemn their interference?
TRUMP, Of course I condemn. Of course I—I don’t know Putin. I have no idea.
WALLACE, I’m not asking—I’m asking do you condemn?
TRUMP," I never met Putin. This is not my best friend. But if the United States got along with Russia, wouldn’t be so bad."
WALLACE," We’re a long way away from immigration, but I’m going to let you finish this topic. You got about 45 seconds."
TRUMP, And she always will be.
CLINTON," I—I find it ironic that he’s raising nuclear weapons. This is a person who has been very cavalier, even casual about the use of nuclear weapons. He’s…"
TRUMP, Wrong.
CLINTON," … advocated more countries getting them, Japan, Korea, even Saudi Arabia. He said, well, if we have them, why don’t we use them, which I think is terrifying."
TRUMP, I have 200 generals…
WALLACE, Very quickly.
TRUMP," … and admirals, 21 endorsing me, 21 congressional Medal of Honor recipients. As far as Japan and other countries, we are being ripped off by everybody in the—we’re defending other countries. We are spending a fortune doing it. They have the bargain of the century."
WALLACE, OK.
TRUMP," Look, she’s been proven to be a liar on so many different ways. This is just another lie."
CLINTON," Well, I’m just quoting you when you were asked…"
TRUMP, There’s no quote. You’re not going to find a quote from me.
CLINTON," … about a potential nuclear—nuclear competition in Asia, you said, you know, go ahead, enjoy yourselves, folks. That kind…"
TRUMP, And defend yourselves.
CLINTON, … of language—well…
TRUMP, And defend yourselves. I didn’t say nuclear. And defend yourself.
CLINTON," The United States has kept the peace—the United States has kept the peace through our alliances. Donald wants to tear up our alliances. I think it makes the world safer and, frankly, it makes the United States safer. I would work with our allies in Asia, in Europe, in the Middle East, and elsewhere. That’s the only way we’re going to be able to keep the peace."
WALLACE," We’re going to—no, we are going to move on to the next topic, which is the economy. And I hope we handle that as well as we did immigration. You also have very different ideas about how to get the economy growing faster. Secretary Clinton, in your plan, government plays a big role. You see more government spending, more entitlements, more tax credits, more tax penalties. Mr. Trump, you want to get government out with lower taxes and less regulation."
TRUMP, Yes.
WALLACE," We’re going to drill down into this a little bit more. But in this overview, please explain to me why you believe that your plan will create more jobs and growth for this country and your opponent’s plan will not. In this round, you go first, Secretary Clinton."
CLINTON," Well, I think when the middle class thrives, America thrives. And so my plan is based on growing the economy, giving middle-class families many more opportunities. I want us to have the biggest jobs program since World War II, jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing. I think we can compete with high-wage countries, and I believe we should. New jobs and clean energy, not only to fight climate change, which is a serious problem, but to create new opportunities and new businesses."
WALLACE," Secretary, thank you. Mr. Trump, why will your plan create more jobs and growth than Secretary Clinton’s?"
TRUMP," Well, first of all, before I start on my plan, her plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes. Her tax plan is a disaster. And she can say all she wants about college tuition. And I’m a big proponent. We’re going to do a lot of things for college tuition. But the rest of the public’s going to be paying for it. We will have a massive, massive tax increase under Hillary Clinton’s plan."
WALLACE," Time, Mr. Trump."
TRUMP," … that’s offshore back into the country. We are going to start the engine rolling again, because…"
WALLACE, Mr. Trump?
TRUMP," … right now, our country is dying at 1 percent GDP."
CLINTON," Well, let me translate that, if I can, Chris, because…"
TRUMP, You can’t.
CLINTON," … the fact is, he’s going to advocate for the largest tax cuts we’ve ever seen, three times more than the tax cuts under the Bush administration. I have said repeatedly throughout this campaign: I will not raise taxes on anyone making $250,000 or less."
WALLACE, Secretary…
CLINTON," Cutting taxes on the wealthy, we’ve tried that. It has not worked the way that it has been promised."
WALLACE," Secretary Clinton, I want to pursue your plan, because in many ways it is similar to the Obama stimulus plan in 2009, which has led to the slowest GDP growth since 1949."
TRUMP, Correct.
WALLACE," Thank you, sir."
CLINTON," Well, it’s a combination, Chris. And let me say that when you inherit the level of economic catastrophe that President Obama inherited, it was a real touch-and-go situation. I was in the Senate before I became secretary of state. I’ve never seen people as physically distraught as the Bush administration team was because of what was happening to the economy."
WALLACE," Mr. Trump, even conservative economists who have looked at your plan say that the numbers don’t add up, that your idea, and you’ve talked about 25 million jobs created, 4 percent…"
TRUMP, Over a 10-year period.
WALLACE," … growth is unrealistic. And they say—you talk a lot about growing the energy industry. They say with oil prices as low as they are right now, that’s unrealistic, as well. Your response, sir?"
TRUMP, So I just left some high representatives of India. They’re growing at 8 percent. China is growing at 7 percent. And that for them is a catastrophically low number.
WALLACE," I want you to give you a chance to briefly speak to that, and then I want to pivot to one-sixth of the economy…"
TRUMP, And that will be as bad as NAFTA.
WALLACE," … which is Obamacare. But go ahead, briefly."
CLINTON," Well, first, let me say, number one, when I saw the final agreement for TPP, I said I was against it. It didn’t meet my test. I’ve had the same test. Does it create jobs, raise incomes, and further our national security? I’m against it now. I’ll be against it after the election. I’ll be against it when I’m president."
WALLACE, Mr. Trump?
CLINTON, That’s the kind of approach that is just not going to work.
TRUMP," Well, let me just say—let me just say."
CLINTON," We’re going to pull the country together. We’re going to have trade agreements that we enforce. That’s why I’m going to have a trade prosecutor for the first time in history. And we’re going to enforce those agreements, and we’re going to look for businesses to help us by buying American products."
WALLACE," Secretary Clinton? Go ahead, Mr. Trump."
TRUMP," I ask a simple question. She’s been doing this for 30 years. Why the hell didn’t you do it over the last 15, 20 years?"
CLINTON," No, I voted."
TRUMP," You were very much involved—excuse me. My turn. You were very much involved in every aspect of this country. Very much. And you do have experience. I say the one thing you have over me is experience, but it’s bad experience, because what you’ve done has turned out badly."
CLINTON," Well, first of all, what he just said about the State Department is not only untrue, it’s been debunked numerous times."
TRUMP, Give me a break.
CLINTON," And on the day when I was in the Situation Room, monitoring the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice, he was hosting the “Celebrity Apprentice.” So I’m happy to compare my 30 years of experience, what I’ve done for this country, trying to help in every way I could, especially kids and families get ahead and stay ahead, with your 30 years, and I’ll let the American people make that decision."
TRUMP," Well, I think I did a much better job. I built a massive company, a great company, some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, worth many, many billions of dollars. I started with a $1 million loan. I agree with that. It’s a $1 million loan. But I built a phenomenal company."
WALLACE," All right. We are going to get to foreign hot spots in a few moments, but the next segment is fitness to be president of the United States. Mr. Trump, at the last debate, you said your talk about grabbing women was just that, talk, and that you’d never actually done it. And since then, as we all know, nine women have come forward and said that you either groped them or kissed them without their consent."
TRUMP," Well, first of all, those stories have been largely debunked. Those people—I don’t know those people. I have a feeling how they came. I believe it was her campaign that did it."
CLINTON, Well…
WALLACE, Secretary Clinton?
CLINTON," At the last debate, we heard Donald talking about what he did to women. And after that, a number of women have come forward saying that’s exactly what he did to them. Now, what was his response? Well, he held a number of big rallies where he said that he could not possibly have done those things to those women because they were not attractive enough for them to be assaulted."
TRUMP, I did not say that. I did not say that.
CLINTON," In fact, he went on to say…"
WALLACE," Her two minutes—sir, her two minutes. Her two minutes."
TRUMP, I did not say that.
WALLACE, It’s her two minutes.
CLINTON," He went on to say, “Look at her. I don’t think so.” About another woman, he said, “That wouldn’t be my first choice.” He attacked the woman reporter writing the story, called her “disgusting,” as he has called a number of women during this campaign."
WALLACE, Mr. Trump…
TRUMP, Nobody has more respect for women than I do. Nobody. [laughter]
WALLACE," Please, everybody."
TRUMP," And frankly, those stories have been largely debunked. And I really want to just talk about something slightly different."
WALLACE, Secretary Clinton?
CLINTON," Well, every time Donald is pushed on something which is obviously uncomfortable, like what these women are saying, he immediately goes to denying responsibility. And it’s not just about women. He never apologizes or says he’s sorry for anything."
TRUMP, Wrong.
CLINTON," He went after Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the parents of a young man who died serving our country, a Gold Star family, because of their religion. He went after John McCain, a prisoner of war, said he prefers “people who aren’t captured.” He went after a federal judge, born in Indiana, but who Donald said couldn’t be trusted to try the fraud and racketeering case against Trump University because his parents were Mexican."
TRUMP," So sad when she talks about violence at my rallies, and she caused the violence. It’s on tape."
WALLACE, During the last…
TRUMP," The other things are false, but honestly, I’d love to talk about getting rid of ISIS, and I’d love to talk about other things…"
WALLACE, OK.
TRUMP," … but those other charges, as she knows, are false."
WALLACE," In this bucket about fitness to be president, there’s been a lot of developments over the last 10 days since the last debate. I’d like to ask you about them. These are questions that the American people have."
CLINTON," Well, everything I did as secretary of state was in furtherance of our country’s interests and our values. The State Department has said that. I think that’s been proven."
WALLACE, Secretary Clinton…
CLINTON," … we have made environments in schools healthier for kids, including healthier lunches…"
WALLACE," Secretary Clinton, respectfully, this is—this is an open discussion."
CLINTON," Well, it is an open discussion. And you…"
WALLACE, And the specific question went to pay for play. Do you want to talk about that?
CLINTON," Well, but there is no—but there is no evidence—but there is…[crosstalk]"
TRUMP, I think that it’s been very well…
WALLACE, Let’s ask Mr. Trump.
CLINTON, There is a lot of evidence about the very good work…
TRUMP, It’s been very well studied.
CLINTON, … and the high rankings…[crosstalk]
WALLACE, Please let Mr. Trump speak.
TRUMP," … and it’s a criminal enterprise, and so many people know it."
WALLACE, Please let Mr. Trump speak.
TRUMP," It’s a criminal enterprise. Saudi Arabia giving $25 million, Qatar, all of these countries. You talk about women and women’s rights? So these are people that push gays off business—off buildings. These are people that kill women and treat women horribly. And yet you take their money."
WALLACE, Secretary Clinton?
CLINTON," Well, very quickly, we at the Clinton Foundation spend 90 percent—90 percent of all the money that is donated on behalf of programs of people around the world and in our own country. I’m very proud of that. We have the highest rating from the watchdogs that follow foundations. And I’d be happy to compare what we do with the Trump Foundation, which took money from other people and bought a six-foot portrait of Donald. I mean, who does that? It just was astonishing."
WALLACE, All right.
CLINTON, … because it’s an important part of the American experience.
TRUMP, They don’t want you to help them anymore.
TRUMP," I’d like to mention one thing. Trump Foundation, small foundation. People contribute, I contribute. The money goes 100 percent—100 percent goes to different charities, including a lot of military. I don’t get anything. I don’t buy boats. I don’t buy planes. What happens—the money goes to them."
WALLACE," Wasn’t some of the money used to settle your lawsuits, sir?"
TRUMP," No, it was—we put up the American flag. And that’s it. They put up the American flag. We fought for the right in Palm Beach to put up the American flag."
WALLACE," Right. But there was a penalty that was imposed by Palm Beach County, and the money came from your foundation…"
TRUMP," There was. There was. And, by the way…"
WALLACE," … instead of Mar-a-Lago or yourself, sir."
TRUMP," … the money—the money went to Fisher House, where they build houses—the money that you’re talking about went to Fisher House, where they build houses for veterans and disabled vets."
WALLACE, I want to get into one…
CLINTON," But, of course, there’s no way we can know whether any of that is true, because he hasn’t released his tax returns. He is the first candidate ever to run for president in the last 40-plus years who has not released his tax returns, so everything he says about charity or anything else, we can’t prove it. You can look at our tax returns. We’ve got them all out there."
WALLACE, I want…
TRUMP," So let me just tell you very quickly, we’re entitled because of the laws that people like her passed to take massive amounts of depreciation on other charges, and we do it. And all of her donors—just about all of them—I know Buffett took hundreds of millions of dollars, Soros, George Soros, took hundreds of millions of dollars…"
WALLACE, We…
TRUMP, Let me just explain.
WALLACE," But, no, we heard this…"
TRUMP, Most of her donors have done the same thing as I do.
WALLACE," Mr. Trump, we—OK."
TRUMP, You know what she should have done?
WALLACE," Folks, we heard this…"
TRUMP," And you know, Hillary, what you should have done, you should have changed the law when you were a United States senator…"
WALLACE," Folks, we heard this…"
TRUMP," … because your donors and your special interests are doing the same thing as I do, except even more so."
CLINTON," Well, you know…"
TRUMP," You should have changed the law. But you won’t change the law, because you take in so much money. I mean, I sat in my apartment today on a very beautiful hotel down the street known as Trump…"
CLINTON, Made with Chinese steel.
TRUMP," But I will tell you, I sat there…[laughter]… I sat there watching ad after ad after ad, false ad. All paid for by your friends on Wall Street that gave so much money because they know you’re going to protect them. And, frankly, you should have changed the laws."
WALLACE, Mr. Trump…
TRUMP," If you don’t like what I did, you should have changed the laws."
WALLACE," Mr. Trump, I want to ask you about one last question in this topic. You have been warning at rallies recently that this election is rigged and that Hillary Clinton is in the process of trying to steal it from you."
TRUMP, I will look at it at the time. I’m not looking at anything now. I’ll look at it at the time.
WALLACE," But, sir, there’s…"
TRUMP," If you look—excuse me, Chris—if you look at your voter rolls, you will see millions of people that are registered to vote—millions, this isn’t coming from me—this is coming from Pew Report and other places—millions of people that are registered to vote that shouldn’t be registered to vote."
WALLACE, But…
TRUMP," Chris, she should never have been allowed to run for the presidency based on what she did with e-mails and so many other things."
WALLACE," But, sir, there is a tradition in this country—in fact, one of the prides of this country—is the peaceful transition of power and that no matter how hard-fought a campaign is, that at the end of the campaign that the loser concedes to the winner. Not saying that you’re necessarily going to be the loser or the winner, but that the loser concedes to the winner and that the country comes together in part for the good of the country. Are you saying you’re not prepared now to commit to that principle?"
TRUMP, What I’m saying is that I will tell you at the time. I’ll keep you in suspense. OK?
CLINTON," Well, Chris, let me respond to that, because that’s horrifying. You know, every time Donald thinks things are not going in his direction, he claims whatever it is, is rigged against him."
TRUMP, Should have gotten it. [laughter]
CLINTON," This is—this is a mindset. This is how Donald thinks. And it’s funny, but it’s also really troubling."
WALLACE, OK.
CLINTON," So that is not the way our democracy works. We’ve been around for 240 years. We’ve had free and fair elections. We’ve accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them. And that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a debate stage during a general election. You know, President Obama said the other day when you’re whining before the game is even finished… [applause]"
WALLACE," Hold on. Hold on, folks. Hold on, folks."
CLINTON," … it just shows you’re not up to doing the job. And let’s—you know, let’s be clear about what he is saying and what that means. He is denigrating—he’s talking down our democracy. And I, for one, am appalled that somebody who is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind of position."
TRUMP," I think what the FBI did and what the Department of Justice did, including meeting with her husband, the attorney general, in the back of an airplane on the tarmac in Arizona, I think it’s disgraceful. I think it’s a disgrace."
WALLACE, All right.
TRUMP, I think we’ve never had a situation so bad in this country. [applause]
WALLACE," Hold on, folks. This doesn’t do any good for anyone. Let’s please continue the debate, and let’s move on to the subject of foreign hot spots."
CLINTON," Well, I am encouraged that there is an effort led by the Iraqi army, supported by Kurdish forces, and also given the help and advice from the number of special forces and other Americans on the ground. But I will not support putting American soldiers into Iraq as an occupying force. I don’t think that is in our interest, and I don’t think that would be smart to do. In fact, Chris, I think that would be a big red flag waving for ISIS to reconstitute itself."
WALLACE," Mr. Trump, same question. If we are able to push ISIS out of Mosul and out of Iraq, will—would you be willing to put U.S. troops in there to prevent their return or something else?"
TRUMP," Let me tell you, Mosul is so sad. We had Mosul. But when she left, when she took everybody out, we lost Mosul. Now we’re fighting again to get Mosul. The problem with Mosul and what they wanted to do is they wanted to get the leaders of ISIS who they felt were in Mosul."
WALLACE," Sir, your two minutes are up."
TRUMP," The point is, the big winner is going to be Iran."
CLINTON," Well, you know, once again, Donald is implying that he didn’t support the invasion of Iraq. I said it was a mistake. I’ve said that years ago. He has consistently denied what is…"
TRUMP, Wrong.
CLINTON, … a very clear fact that…
TRUMP, Wrong.
CLINTON," … before the invasion, he supported it. And, you know, I just want everybody to go Google it. Google “Donald Trump Iraq.” And you will see the dozens of sources which verify that he was for the invasion of Iraq."
TRUMP, Wrong.
CLINTON," And you can actually hear the audio of him saying that. Now, why does that matter? Well, it matters because he has not told the truth about that position. I guess he believes it makes him look better now to contrast with me because I did vote for it."
TRUMP," Chris, we don’t gain anything."
CLINTON, He has all the conspiracy theories…[crosstalk]
TRUMP, Iran is taking over Iraq.
WALLACE," Secretary Clinton, it’s…[crosstalk]"
TRUMP, Iran is taking over Iraq. We don’t gain anything.
CLINTON," This conspiracy theory, which he’s been spewing out for quite some time."
TRUMP, We would’ve gained if they did it by surprise…[crosstalk]
WALLACE," Wait, wait, wait, Secretary Clinton, it’s an open discussion."
CLINTON, He says…[crosstalk]
TRUMP, We would have gained if they did it by surprise.
WALLACE," Secretary, please let Mr. Trump speak."
CLINTON," … unfit, and he proves it every time he talks."
TRUMP," No, you are the one that’s unfit. You know, WikiLeaks just actually came out—John Podesta said some horrible things about you, and, boy, was he right. He said some beauties. And you know, Bernie Sanders, he said you have bad judgment. You do."
CLINTON," Well, you should ask Bernie Sanders who he’s supporting for president. And he has said…"
TRUMP, Which is a big mistake.
CLINTON," … as he has campaigned for me around the country, you are the most dangerous person to run for president in the modern history of America. I think he’s right."
WALLACE," Let’s turn to Aleppo. Mr. Trump, in the last debate, you were both asked about the situation in the Syrian city of Aleppo. And I want to follow up on that, because you said several things in that debate which were not true, sir. You said that Aleppo has basically fallen. In fact, there—in fact, there are…"
TRUMP, It’s a catastrophe. I mean…
WALLACE," It’s a catastrophe, but there…"
TRUMP, … it’s a mess.
WALLACE, There are a quarter of…
TRUMP, Have you seen it? Have you seen it?
WALLACE, Sir…
TRUMP, Have you seen what’s happened to Aleppo?
WALLACE," Sir, if I may finish my question…"
TRUMP," OK, so it hasn’t fallen. Take a look at it."
WALLACE," Well, there are a quarter of a million people still living there and being slaughtered."
TRUMP, That’s right. And they are being slaughtered…
WALLACE, Yes.
TRUMP, … because of bad decisions.
WALLACE," If I may just finish here, and you also said that—that Syria and Russia are busy fighting ISIS. In fact, they have been the ones who’ve been bombing and shelling eastern Aleppo, and they just announced a humanitarian pause, in effect, admitting that they have been bombing and shelling Aleppo. Would you like to clear that up, sir?"
TRUMP," Well, Aleppo is a disaster. It’s a humanitarian nightmare. But it has fallen from the—from any standpoint. I mean, what do you need, a signed document? Take a look at Aleppo. It is so sad when you see what’s happened."
WALLACE, Let me…
TRUMP," … in many cases, ISIS-aligned, and we now have them in our country, and wait until you see—this is going to be the great Trojan horse. And wait until you see what happens in the coming years. Lots of luck, Hillary. Thanks a lot for doing a great job."
WALLACE," Secretary Clinton, you have talked about—and in the last debate and again today—that you would impose a no-fly zone to try to protect the people of Aleppo and to stop the killing there. President Obama has refused to do that because he fears it’s going to draw us closer or deeper into the conflict."
CLINTON," Well, Chris, first of all, I think a no-fly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict. I’m well aware of the really legitimate concerns that you have expressed from both the president and the general."
WALLACE," Folks, I want to get into our final segment."
TRUMP, But I just have to…
WALLACE, Real quick.
TRUMP," It’s so ridiculous what she—she will defeat ISIS. We should have never let ISIS happen in the first place. And right now, they’re in 32 countries."
WALLACE, OK.
TRUMP," We should have—wait one second. They had a cease-fire three weeks ago. A cease-fire, United States, Russia, and Syria. And during the cease-fire, Russia took over vast swatches of land, and then they said we don’t want the cease-fire anymore."
WALLACE," Mr. Trump, Secretary Clinton—no, we need to move on to our final segment, and that is the national debt, which has not been discussed until tonight."
TRUMP," Well, I say they’re wrong, because I’m going to create tremendous jobs. And we’re bringing GDP from, really, 1 percent, which is what it is now, and if she got in, it will be less than zero. But we’re bringing it from 1 percent up to 4 percent. And I actually think we can go higher than 4 percent. I think you can go to 5 percent or 6 percent. And if we do, you don’t have to bother asking your question, because we have a tremendous machine. We will have created a tremendous economic machine once again. To do that, we’re taking back jobs. We’re not going to let our companies be raided by other countries where we lose all our jobs, we don’t make our product anymore. It’s very sad. But I’m going to create a—the kind of a country that we were from the standpoint of industry. We used to be there. We’ve given it up. We’ve become very, very sloppy."
WALLACE, Secretary Clinton?
CLINTON," Well, first, when I hear Donald talk like that and know that his slogan is “Make America Great Again,” I wonder when he thought America was great. And before he rushes and says, “You know, before you and President Obama were there,” I think it’s important to recognize that he has been criticizing our government for decades."
TRUMP," Yeah, yeah, we’ve heard—we’ve heard this before, Hillary."
CLINTON, I started off with—my dad was a small-business man.
TRUMP, We’ve heard this before.
CLINTON," And I think it—you know, it’s a difference that affects how we see the world and what we want to do with the economy."
WALLACE, Time.
TRUMP," Thank you, Hillary. Could I just respond?"
WALLACE," Well, no, sir, because we’re running out of time…"
TRUMP, Because I did disagree with Ronald Reagan very strongly on trade. I disagreed with him. We should have been much tougher on trade even then. I’ve been waiting for years. Nobody does it right.
WALLACE, OK.
TRUMP," And frankly, now we’re going to do it right."
WALLACE," All right. The one last area I want to get into with you in this debate is the fact that the biggest driver of our debt is entitlements, which is 60 percent of all federal spending. Now, the Committee for federal—a Responsible Federal Budget has looked at both of your plans and they say neither of you has a serious plan that is going to solve the fact that Medicare’s going to run out of money in the 2020s, Social Security is going to run out of money in the 2030s, and at that time, recipients are going to take huge cuts in their benefits."
TRUMP, I’m cutting taxes. We’re going to grow the economy. It’s going to grow at a record rate of growth.
WALLACE, That’s not going to help in the entitlements.
TRUMP," No, it’s going to totally help you. And one thing we have to do: Repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare. It’s destroying our country. It’s destroying our businesses, our small business and our big businesses. We have to repeal and replace Obamacare."
WALLACE," And, Secretary Clinton, same question, because at this point, Social Security and Medicare are going to run out, the trust funds are going to run out of money. Will you as president entertain—will you consider a grand bargain, a deal that includes both tax increases and benefit cuts to try to save both programs?"
CLINTON," Well, Chris, I am on record as saying that we need to put more money into the Social Security Trust Fund. That’s part of my commitment to raise taxes on the wealthy. My Social Security payroll contribution will go up, as will Donald’s, assuming he can’t figure out how to get out of it. But what we want to do is to replenish the Social Security Trust Fund…"
TRUMP, Such a nasty woman.
CLINTON," … by making sure that we have sufficient resources, and that will come from either raising the cap and/or finding other ways to get more money into it. I will not cut benefits. I want to enhance benefits for low-income workers and for women who have been disadvantaged by the current Social Security system."
TRUMP, Your husband disagrees with you.
CLINTON," … the long-term health care drivers. We’ve got to get costs down, increase value, emphasize wellness. I have a plan for doing that. And I think that we will be able to get entitlement spending under control by with more resources and smarter decisions."
WALLACE," This is—this is the final time, probably to both of your delight, that you’re going to be on a stage together in this campaign. I would like to end it on a positive note. You had not agreed to closing statements, but it seems to me in a funny way that might make it more interesting because you haven’t prepared closing statements."
CLINTON," Well, I would like to say to everyone watching tonight that I’m reaching out to all Americans—Democrats, Republicans, and independents—because we need everybody to help make our country what it should be, to grow the economy, to make it fairer, to make it work for everyone. We need your talents, your skills, your commitments, your energy, your ambition."
WALLACE," Secretary Clinton, thank you."
TRUMP, She’s raising the money from the people she wants to control. Doesn’t work that way.
WALLACE, Thank you both. [applause]
WALLACE," Good evening from the Thomas and Mack Center at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. I’m Chris Wallace of Fox News, and I welcome you to the third and final of the 2016 presidential debates between Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump."
RADDATZ, Good evening. I’m Martha Raddatz from ABC News.
COOPER," And I’m Anderson Cooper from CNN. We want to welcome you to Washington University in St. Louis for the second presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Tonight’s debate is a town hall format, which gives voters a chance to directly ask the candidates questions. Martha and I will ask follow-up questions but the night really belongs to the people in this room, and to people across the country who have submitted questions online."
RADDATZ," The people you see on this stage were chosen by the Gallup Organization. They are all from the St. Louis area and told Gallup they haven’t committed to a candidate. Each of them came here with questions they wanted to ask, and we saw those questions for the first time this morning. Anderson and I and our team from ABC and CNN are the only ones who have seen them. Both candidates will have two minutes to answer each audience and online question. We hope to get to as many questions as we can, so we’ve asked the audience here not to slow things down with any applause. Except for now."
RADDATZ," Ladies and gentlemen the Republican nominee for president, Donald J. Trump, and the Democratic nominee for president, Hillary Clinton. [applause]"
COOPER," Thank you very much for being here. We’re going to begin with a question from one of the members in our town hall. Each of you will have two minutes to respond to this question. Secretary Clinton, you won the coin toss, so you’ll go first. Our first question comes from Patrice Brock. Patrice?"
QUESTION," Thank you, and good evening. The last presidential debate could have been rated as MA, mature audiences, per TV parental guidelines. Knowing that educators assign viewing the presidential debates as students’ homework, do you feel you’re modeling appropriate and positive behavior for today’s youth?"
CLINTON," Well, thank you. Are you a teacher? Yes, I think that that’s a very good question, because I’ve heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign."
COOPER," Secretary Clinton, thank you. Mr. Trump, you have two minutes."
TRUMP," Well, I actually agree with that. I agree with everything she said. I began this campaign because I was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country. This is a great country. This is a great land. I’ve gotten to know the people of the country over the last year-and-a-half that I’ve been doing this as a politician. I cannot believe I’m saying that about myself, but I guess I have been a politician."
COOPER," Thank you, Mr. Trump. The question from Patrice was about are you both modeling positive and appropriate behavior for today’s youth? We received a lot of questions online, Mr. Trump, about the tape that was released on Friday, as you can imagine. You called what you said locker room banter. You described kissing women without consent, grabbing their genitals. That is sexual assault. You bragged that you have sexually assaulted women. Do you understand that?"
TRUMP," No, I didn’t say that at all. I don’t think you understood what was—this was locker room talk. I’m not proud of it. I apologize to my family. I apologize to the American people. Certainly, I’m not proud of it. But this is locker room talk."
COOPER," So, Mr. Trump…"
TRUMP, And we should get on to much more important things and much bigger things.
COOPER," Just for the record, though, are you saying that what you said on that bus 11 years ago that you did not actually kiss women without consent or grope women without consent?"
TRUMP, I have great respect for women. Nobody has more respect for women than I do.
COOPER," So, for the record, you’re saying you never did that?"
TRUMP," I’ve said things that, frankly, you hear these things I said. And I was embarrassed by it. But I have tremendous respect for women."
COOPER, Have you ever done those things?
TRUMP," And women have respect for me. And I will tell you: No, I have not. And I will tell you that I’m going to make our country safe. We’re going to have borders in our country, which we don’t have now. People are pouring into our country, and they’re coming in from the Middle East and other places."
COOPER," Thank you, Mr. Trump."
TRUMP," Right now, other nations are taking our jobs and they’re taking our wealth."
COOPER," Thank you, Mr. Trump."
TRUMP, And that’s what I want to talk about.
COOPER," Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond?"
CLINTON," Well, like everyone else, I’ve spent a lot of time thinking over the last 48 hours about what we heard and saw. You know, with prior Republican nominees for president, I disagreed with them on politics, policies, principles, but I never questioned their fitness to serve."
RADDATZ, And we want to get to some questions from online…
TRUMP, Am I allowed to respond to that? I assume I am.
RADDATZ," Yes, you can respond to that."
TRUMP," It’s just words, folks. It’s just words. Those words, I’ve been hearing them for many years. I heard them when they were running for the Senate in New York, where Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed."
RADDATZ," Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump—I want to get to audience questions and online questions."
TRUMP," So, she’s allowed to do that, but I’m not allowed to respond?"
RADDATZ, You’re going to have—you’re going to get to respond right now.
TRUMP, Sounds fair.
RADDATZ," This tape is generating intense interest. In just 48 hours, it’s become the single most talked about story of the entire 2016 election on Facebook, with millions and millions of people discussing it on the social network. As we said a moment ago, we do want to bring in questions from voters around country via social media, and our first stays on this topic. Jeff from Ohio asks on Facebook, “Trump says the campaign has changed him. When did that happen?” So, Mr. Trump, let me add to that. When you walked off that bus at age 59, were you a different man or did that behavior continue until just recently? And you have two minutes for this."
TRUMP," It was locker room talk, as I told you. That was locker room talk. I’m not proud of it. I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country. And certainly, I’m not proud of it. But that was something that happened."
RADDATZ," Can we please hold the applause? Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes."
CLINTON," Well, first, let me start by saying that so much of what he’s just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses. He gets to decide what he wants to talk about. Instead of answering people’s questions, talking about our agenda, laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country, that’s his choice."
TRUMP," Well, you owe the president an apology, because as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthal—he’s another real winner that you have—and he’s the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that. So you really owe him an apology. You’re the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb. That was long before I was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology."
RADDATZ," Secretary Clinton, I want to follow up on that."
RADDATZ, I’m going to let you talk about e-mails.
CLINTON," … because everything he just said is absolutely false, but I’m not surprised."
TRUMP," Oh, really?"
CLINTON, In the first debate…[laughter]
RADDATZ," And really, the audience needs to calm down here."
CLINTON, … I told people that it would be impossible to be fact-checking Donald all the time. I’d never get to talk about anything I want to do and how we’re going to really make lives better for people.
TRUMP, Because you’d be in jail. [applause]
RADDATZ, Secretary Clinton…
COOPER, We want to remind the audience to please not talk out loud. Please do not applaud. You’re just wasting time.
RADDATZ," And, Secretary Clinton, I do want to follow up on e- mails. You’ve said your handing of your e-mails was a mistake. You disagreed with FBI Director James Comey, calling your handling of classified information, quote, “extremely careless.” The FBI said that there were 110 classified e-mails that were exchanged, eight of which were top secret, and that it was possible hostile actors did gain access to those e-mails. You don’t call that extremely careless?"
CLINTON," Well, Martha, first, let me say—and I’ve said before, but I’ll repeat it, because I want everyone to hear it—that was a mistake, and I take responsibility for using a personal e-mail account. Obviously, if I were to do it over again, I would not. I’m not making any excuses. It was a mistake. And I am very sorry about that."
RADDATZ," OK, we’re going to move on."
TRUMP, And yet she didn’t know the word—the letter C on a document. Right? She didn’t even know what that word—what that letter meant.
COOPER, We have to move on.
TRUMP, You did that. Wait a minute. One second.
COOPER," Secretary Clinton, you can respond, and then we’ve got to move on."
RADDATZ, We want to give the audience a chance.
TRUMP," If you did that in the private sector, you’d be put in jail, let alone after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress."
COOPER," Secretary Clinton, you can respond. Then we have to move on to an audience question."
CLINTON," Look, it’s just not true. And so please, go to…"
TRUMP," Oh, you didn’t delete them?"
COOPER," Allow her to respond, please."
CLINTON," It was personal e-mails, not official."
TRUMP," Oh, 33,000? Yeah."
CLINTON," Not—well, we turned over 35,000, so…"
TRUMP," Oh, yeah. What about the other 15,000?"
COOPER, Please allow her to respond. She didn’t talk while you talked.
CLINTON," Yes, that’s true, I didn’t."
TRUMP, Because you have nothing to say.
CLINTON," I didn’t in the first debate, and I’m going to try not to in this debate, because I’d like to get to the questions that the people have brought here tonight to talk to us about."
TRUMP, And get off this question.
CLINTON," OK, Donald. I know you’re into big diversion tonight, anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way it’s exploding and the way Republicans are leaving you. But let’s at least focus…"
TRUMP, Let’s see what happens…[crosstalk]
COOPER, Allow her to respond.
CLINTON, … on some of the issues that people care about tonight. Let’s get to their questions.
COOPER, We have a question here from Ken Karpowicz. He has a question about health care. Ken?
TRUMP," I’d like to know, Anderson, why aren’t you bringing up the e-mails? I’d like to know. Why aren’t you bringing…"
COOPER, We brought up the e-mails.
TRUMP," No, it hasn’t. It hasn’t. And it hasn’t been finished at all."
COOPER, Ken Karpowicz has a question.
TRUMP, It’s nice to—one on three.
QUESTION," Thank you. Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, it is not affordable. Premiums have gone up. Deductibles have gone up. Copays have gone up. Prescriptions have gone up. And the coverage has gone down. What will you do to bring the cost down and make coverage better?"
COOPER," That first one goes to Secretary Clinton, because you started out the last one to the audience."
CLINTON," If he wants to start, he can start. No, go ahead, Donald."
TRUMP," No, I’m a gentleman, Hillary. Go ahead. [laughter]"
COOPER, Secretary Clinton?
CLINTON," Well, I think Donald was about to say he’s going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act. And I’m going to fix it, because I agree with you. Premiums have gotten too high. Copays, deductibles, prescription drug costs, and I’ve laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down."
COOPER," Secretary Clinton, your time is up."
CLINTON," So I want us to get to 100 percent, but get costs down and keep quality up."
COOPER," Mr. Trump, you have two minutes."
TRUMP," It is such a great question and it’s maybe the question I get almost more than anything else, outside of defense. Obamacare is a disaster. You know it. We all know it. It’s going up at numbers that nobody’s ever seen worldwide. Nobody’s ever seen numbers like this for health care."
COOPER," Mr. Trump, your time…"
TRUMP," It is a disastrous plan, and it has to be repealed and replaced."
COOPER," Secretary Clinton, let me follow up with you. Your husband called Obamacare, quote, “the craziest thing in the world,” saying that small-business owners are getting killed as premiums double, coverage is cut in half. Was he mistaken or was the mistake simply telling the truth?"
CLINTON," No, I mean, he clarified what he meant. And it’s very clear. Look, we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system. But we have an employer-based system. That’s where the vast majority of people get their health care."
COOPER, Secretary Clinton…
CLINTON," … get to do pretty much whatever they want, including saying, look, I’m sorry, you’ve got diabetes, you had cancer, your child has asthma…"
COOPER, Your time is up.
CLINTON," … you may not be able to have insurance because you can’t afford it. So let’s fix what’s broken about it, but let’s not throw it away and give it all back to the insurance companies and the drug companies. That’s not going to work."
COOPER," Mr. Trump, let me follow up on this."
TRUMP," Well, I just want—just one thing. First of all, Hillary, everything’s broken about it. Everything. Number two, Bernie Sanders said that Hillary Clinton has very bad judgment. This is a perfect example of it, trying to save Obamacare, which is a disaster."
COOPER, You’ve said you want to end Obamacare…
TRUMP, By the way…
COOPER, You’ve said you want to end Obamacare. You’ve also said you want to make coverage accessible for people with pre-existing conditions. How do you force insurance companies to do that if you’re no longer mandating that every American get insurance?
TRUMP, We’re going to be able to. You’re going to have plans…
COOPER, What does that mean?
TRUMP," Well, I’ll tell you what it means. You’re going to have plans that are so good, because we’re going to have so much competition in the insurance industry. Once we break out—once we break out the lines and allow the competition to come…"
COOPER, Are you going—are you going to have a mandate that Americans have to have health insurance?
TRUMP," President Obama—Anderson, excuse me. President Obama, by keeping those lines, the boundary lines around each state, it was almost gone until just very toward the end of the passage of Obamacare, which, by the way, was a fraud. You know that, because Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, was said—he said it was a great lie, it was a big lie. President Obama said you keep your doctor, you keep your plan. The whole thing was a fraud, and it doesn’t work."
COOPER," Thank you, Mr. Trump."
TRUMP, … so that we will be able to take care of people without the necessary funds to take care of themselves.
COOPER," Thank you, Mr. Trump."
RADDATZ, We now go to Gorbah Hamed with a question for both candidates.
QUESTION," Hi. There are 3.3 million Muslims in the United States, and I’m one of them. You’ve mentioned working with Muslim nations, but with Islamophobia on the rise, how will you help people like me deal with the consequences of being labeled as a threat to the country after the election is over?"
RADDATZ," Mr. Trump, you’re first."
TRUMP," Well, you’re right about Islamophobia, and that’s a shame. But one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that—because there is a problem. I mean, whether we like it or not, and we could be very politically correct, but whether we like it or not, there is a problem. And we have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on. When they see hatred going on, they have to report it."
RADDATZ, Secretary Clinton?
CLINTON," Well, thank you for asking your question. And I’ve heard this question from a lot of Muslim-Americans across our country, because, unfortunately, there’s been a lot of very divisive, dark things said about Muslims. And even someone like Captain Khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the United States Army, has been subject to attack by Donald."
RADDATZ," Thank you, Secretary Clinton."
TRUMP," First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero, and if I were president at that time, he would be alive today, because unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq. Iraq was a disaster. So he would have been alive today."
RADDATZ," And why did it morph into that? No, did you—no, answer the question. Do you still believe…"
TRUMP, Why don’t you interrupt her? You interrupt me all the time.
RADDATZ, I do.
TRUMP, Why don’t you interrupt her?
RADDATZ, Would you please explain whether or not the Muslim ban still stands?
TRUMP," It’s called extreme vetting. We are going to areas like Syria where they’re coming in by the tens of thousands because of Barack Obama. And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama. People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more. This is going to be the great Trojan horse of all time."
RADDATZ," And, Secretary Clinton, let me ask you about that, because you have asked for an increase from 10,000 to 65,000 Syrian refugees. We know you want tougher vetting. That’s not a perfect system. So why take the risk of having those refugees come into the country?"
CLINTON," Well, first of all, I will not let anyone into our country that I think poses a risk to us. But there are a lot of refugees, women and children—think of that picture we all saw of that 4-year-old boy with the blood on his forehead because he’d been bombed by the Russian and Syrian air forces."
TRUMP, That’s not been debunked.
CLINTON," So, please…"
TRUMP, That has not been debunked.
CLINTON, … go to HillaryClinton.com and you can see it.
TRUMP," I was against—I was against the war in Iraq. Has not been debunked. And you voted for it. And you shouldn’t have. Well, I just want to say…"
RADDATZ, There’s been lots of fact-checking on that. I’d like to move on to an online question…
TRUMP, Excuse me. She just went about 25 seconds over her time.
RADDATZ, She did not.
TRUMP," Could I just respond to this, please?"
RADDATZ," Very quickly, please."
TRUMP," Hillary Clinton, in terms of having people come into our country, we have many criminal illegal aliens. When we want to send them back to their country, their country says we don’t want them. In some cases, they’re murderers, drug lords, drug problems. And they don’t want them."
RADDATZ," Thank you, Mr. Trump. I want to move on. This next question comes from the public through the Bipartisan Open Debate Coalition’s online forum, where Americans submitted questions that generated millions of votes. This question involves WikiLeaks release of purported excerpts of Secretary Clinton’s paid speeches, which she has refused to release, and one line in particular, in which you, Secretary Clinton, purportedly say you need both a public and private position on certain issues. So, Tu, from Virginia asks, is it OK for politicians to be two-faced? Is it acceptable for a politician to have a private stance on issues? Secretary Clinton, your two minutes."
CLINTON," Well, right. As I recall, that was something I said about Abraham Lincoln after having seen the wonderful Steven Spielberg movie called “Lincoln.” It was a master class watching President Lincoln get the Congress to approve the 13th Amendment. It was principled, and it was strategic."
RADDATZ," We’re going to get to that later. Secretary Clinton, you’re out of time."
CLINTON, … with the Russians and other foreign powers.
RADDATZ, Mr. Trump?
TRUMP," Well, I think I should respond, because—so ridiculous. Look, now she’s blaming—she got caught in a total lie. Her papers went out to all her friends at the banks, Goldman Sachs and everybody else, and she said things—WikiLeaks that just came out. And she lied. Now she’s blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln. That’s one that I haven’t…[laughter]"
RADDATZ," Thank you, Mr. Trump."
COOPER," We want to turn, actually, to the topic of taxes. We have a question from Spencer Maass. Spencer?"
QUESTION," Good evening. My question is, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share in taxes?"
COOPER," Mr. Trump, you have two minutes."
TRUMP," Well, one thing I’d do is get rid of carried interest. One of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, I give up a lot when I run, because I knock out the tax code. And she could have done this years ago, by the way. She’s a United States—she was a United States senator."
COOPER," Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes. The question was, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share of taxes?"
CLINTON," Well, everything you’ve heard just now from Donald is not true. I’m sorry I have to keep saying this, but he lives in an alternative reality. And it is sort of amusing to hear somebody who hasn’t paid federal income taxes in maybe 20 years talking about what he’s going to do."
COOPER," Thank you, Secretary."
CLINTON," And we’re going to make sure that nobody, no corporation, and no individual can get away without paying his fair share to support our country."
COOPER," Thank you. I want to give you—Mr. Trump, I want to give you the chance to respond. I just wanted to tell our viewers what she’s referring to. In the last month, taxes were the number-one issue on Facebook for the first time in the campaign. The New York Times published three pages of your 1995 tax returns. They show you claimed a $916 million loss, which means you could have avoided paying personal federal income taxes for years. You’ve said you pay state taxes, employee taxes, real estate taxes, property taxes. You have not answered, though, a simple question. Did you use that $916 million loss to avoid paying personal federal income taxes for years?"
TRUMP," Of course I do. Of course I do. And so do all of her donors, or most of her donors. I know many of her donors. Her donors took massive tax write-offs."
COOPER, So have you paid personal federal income tax?
TRUMP," A lot of my—excuse me, Anderson—a lot of my write- off was depreciation and other things that Hillary as a senator allowed. And she’ll always allow it, because the people that give her all this money, they want it. That’s why."
COOPER, So can you—can you say how many years you have avoided paying personal federal income taxes?
TRUMP," No, but I pay tax, and I pay federal tax, too. But I have a write-off, a lot of it’s depreciation, which is a wonderful charge. I love depreciation. You know, she’s given it to us."
COOPER, In the past…
TRUMP," And, again, Bernie Sanders, it’s really bad judgment. She has made bad judgment not only on taxes. She’s made bad judgments on Libya, on Syria, on Iraq. I mean, her and Obama, whether you like it or not, the way they got out of Iraq, the vacuum they’ve left, that’s why ISIS formed in the first place. They started from that little area, and now they’re in 32 different nations, Hillary. Congratulations. Great job."
COOPER," Secretary—I want you to be able to respond, Secretary Clinton."
CLINTON," Well, here we go again. I’ve been in favor of getting rid of carried interest for years, starting when I was a senator from New York. But that’s not the point here."
TRUMP, Why didn’t you do it? Why didn’t you do it?
COOPER, Allow her to respond.
CLINTON, Because I was a senator with a Republican president.
TRUMP," Oh, really?"
CLINTON, I will be the president and we will get it done. That’s exactly right.
TRUMP," You could have done it, if you were an effective—if you were an effective senator, you could have done it. If you were an effective senator, you could have done it. But you were not an effective senator."
COOPER, Please allow her to respond. She didn’t interrupt you.
CLINTON," You know, under our Constitution, presidents have something called veto power. Look, he has now said repeatedly, “30 years this and 30 years that.” So let me talk about my 30 years in public service. I’m very glad to do so."
COOPER," Thank you, secretary."
CLINTON," And I’ve proven that I can, and for 30 years, I’ve produced results for people."
COOPER," Thank you, secretary."
RADDATZ, We’re going to move on to Syria. Both of you have mentioned that.
TRUMP," She said a lot of things that were false. I mean, I think we should be allowed to maybe…"
RADDATZ," No, we can—no, Mr. Trump, we’re going to go on. This is about the audience."
TRUMP, Excuse me. Because she has been a disaster as a senator. A disaster.
RADDATZ," Mr. Trump, we’re going to move on. The heart-breaking video of a 5-year-old Syrian boy named Omran sitting in an ambulance after being pulled from the rubble after an air strike in Aleppo focused the world’s attention on the horrors of the war in Syria, with 136 million views on Facebook alone."
CLINTON," Well, the situation in Syria is catastrophic. And every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by Assad in partnership with the Iranians on the ground, the Russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular Aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left. And there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime."
RADDATZ," Thank you, Secretary Clinton. Mr. Trump?"
TRUMP," First of all, she was there as secretary of state with the so-called line in the sand, which…"
CLINTON," No, I wasn’t. I was gone. I hate to interrupt you, but at some point…"
TRUMP, OK. But you were in contact—excuse me. You were…
CLINTON," At some point, we need to do some fact-checking here."
TRUMP," You were in total contact with the White House, and perhaps, sadly, Obama probably still listened to you. I don’t think he would be listening to you very much anymore."
RADDATZ," Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump, your two minutes is up."
TRUMP, And one thing I have to say.
RADDATZ, Your two minutes is up.
TRUMP," I don’t like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS. Russia is killing ISIS. And Iran is killing ISIS. And those three have now lined up because of our weak foreign policy."
RADDATZ," Mr. Trump, let me repeat the question. If you were president…[laughter]…what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo? And I want to remind you what your running mate said. He said provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength and that if Russia continues to be involved in air strikes along with the Syrian government forces of Assad, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike the military targets of the Assad regime."
TRUMP," OK. He and I haven’t spoken, and I disagree. I disagree."
RADDATZ, You disagree with your running mate?
TRUMP," I think you have to knock out ISIS. Right now, Syria is fighting ISIS. We have people that want to fight both at the same time. But Syria is no longer Syria. Syria is Russia and it’s Iran, who she made strong and Kerry and Obama made into a very powerful nation and a very rich nation, very, very quickly, very, very quickly."
RADDATZ, What do you think will happen if Aleppo falls?
TRUMP," I think Aleppo is a disaster, humanitarian-wise."
RADDATZ, What do you think will happen if it falls?
TRUMP," I think that it basically has fallen. OK? It basically has fallen. Let me tell you something. You take a look at Mosul. The biggest problem I have with the stupidity of our foreign policy, we have Mosul. They think a lot of the ISIS leaders are in Mosul. So we have announcements coming out of Washington and coming out of Iraq, we will be attacking Mosul in three weeks or four weeks."
RADDATZ, There are sometimes reasons the military does that. Psychological warfare.
TRUMP, I can’t think of any. I can’t think of any. And I’m pretty good at it.
RADDATZ, It might be to help get civilians out.
TRUMP," And we have General Flynn. And we have—look, I have 200 generals and admirals who endorsed me. I have 21 Congressional Medal of Honor recipients who endorsed me. We talk about it all the time. They understand, why can’t they do something secretively, where they go in and they knock out the leadership? How—why would these people stay there? I’ve been reading now…"
RADDATZ, Tell me what your strategy is.
TRUMP," … for weeks—I’ve been reading now for weeks about Mosul, that it’s the harbor of where—you know, between Raqqa and Mosul, this is where they think the ISIS leaders are. Why would they be saying—they’re not staying there anymore. They’re gone. Because everybody’s talking about how Iraq, which is us with our leadership, goes in to fight Mosul."
RADDATZ," I’m going to go to Secretary Clinton. Secretary Clinton, you want Assad to go. You advocated arming rebels, but it looks like that may be too late for Aleppo. You talk about diplomatic efforts. Those have failed. Cease-fires have failed. Would you introduce the threat of U.S. military force beyond a no-fly zone against the Assad regime to back up diplomacy?"
CLINTON," I would not use American ground forces in Syria. I think that would be a very serious mistake. I don’t think American troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force. I don’t think that is a smart strategy."
RADDATZ, But what would you do differently than President Obama is doing?
CLINTON," Well, Martha, I hope that by the time I—if I’m fortunate…"
TRUMP, Everything.
CLINTON," I hope by the time I am president that we will have pushed ISIS out of Iraq. I do think that there is a good chance that we can take Mosul. And, you know, Donald says he knows more about ISIS than the generals. No, he doesn’t."
RADDATZ, Thank you very much. We’re going to move on…
TRUMP," You know what’s funny? She went over a minute over, and you don’t stop her. When I go one second over, it’s like a big deal."
RADDATZ, You had many answers.
TRUMP, It’s really—it’s really very interesting.
COOPER, We’ve got a question over here from James Carter. Mr. Carter?
QUESTION," My question is, do you believe you can be a devoted president to all the people in the United States?"
COOPER, That question begins for Mr. Trump.
TRUMP," Absolutely. I mean, she calls our people deplorable, a large group, and irredeemable. I will be a president for all of our people. And I’ll be a president that will turn our inner cities around and will give strength to people and will give economics to people and will bring jobs back."
COOPER," Mr. Trump, thank you."
TRUMP," But I will tell you, she’s all talk. It doesn’t get done. All you have to do is take a look at her Senate run. Take a look at upstate New York."
COOPER," Your two minutes is up. Secretary Clinton, two minutes?"
TRUMP, It turned out to be a disaster.
COOPER," You have two minutes, Secretary Clinton."
CLINTON," Well, 67 percent of the people voted to re-elect me when I ran for my second term, and I was very proud and very humbled by that."
COOPER," Your time, Secretary Clinton."
CLINTON," Democrats, Republicans, independents, people across our country. If you don’t vote for me, I still want to be your president."
COOPER, Your two minutes is up.
CLINTON, I want to be the best president I can be for every American.
COOPER," Secretary Clinton, your two minutes is up. I want to follow up on something that Donald Trump actually said to you, a comment you made last month. You said that half of Donald Trump’s supporters are, quote, “deplorables, racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic.” You later said you regretted saying half. You didn’t express regret for using the term “deplorables.” To Mr. Carter’s question, how can you unite a country if you’ve written off tens of millions of Americans?"
CLINTON," Well, within hours I said that I was sorry about the way I talked about that, because my argument is not with his supporters. It’s with him and with the hateful and divisive campaign that he has run, and the inciting of violence at his rallies, and the very brutal kinds of comments about not just women, but all Americans, all kinds of Americans."
COOPER, Thank you.
CLINTON," Because we talked about what we wanted to do. We might have had some differences, and we had a lot of debates…"
COOPER," Thank you, Secretary."
TRUMP, … but we believed that we could make the country better. And I was proud of that.
COOPER, I want to give you a minute to respond.
TRUMP," We have a divided nation. We have a very divided nation. You look at Charlotte. You look at Baltimore. You look at the violence that’s taking place in the inner cities, Chicago, you take a look at Washington, D.C."
COOPER, She said some of them are irredeemable.
TRUMP," She’s got tremendous—she’s got tremendous hatred. And this country cannot take another four years of Barack Obama, and that’s what you’re getting with her."
COOPER," Mr. Trump, let me follow up with you. In 2008, you wrote in one of your books that the most important characteristic of a good leader is discipline. You said, if a leader doesn’t have it, quote, “he or she won’t be one for very long.” In the days after the first debate, you sent out a series of tweets from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m., including one that told people to check out a sex tape. Is that the discipline of a good leader?"
TRUMP," No, there wasn’t check out a sex tape. It was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout."
COOPER, You mentioned sex tape.
TRUMP," By the way, just so you understand, when she said 3 o’clock in the morning, take a look at Benghazi. She said who is going to answer the call at 3 o’clock in the morning? Guess what? She didn’t answer it, because when Ambassador Stevens…"
COOPER," The question is, is that the discipline of a good leader?"
TRUMP," … 600—wait a minute, Anderson, 600 times. Well, she said she was awake at 3 o’clock in the morning, and she also sent a tweet out at 3 o’clock in the morning, but I won’t even mention that. But she said she’ll be awake. Who’s going—the famous thing, we’re going to answer our call at 3 o’clock in the morning. Guess what happened? Ambassador Stevens—Ambassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help. And the only one she talked to was Sidney Blumenthal, who’s her friend and not a good guy, by the way. So, you know, she shouldn’t be talking about that."
COOPER," Secretary Clinton, does Mr. Trump have the discipline to be a good leader?"
CLINTON, No.
TRUMP, I’m shocked to hear that. [laughter]
CLINTON," Well, it’s not only my opinion. It’s the opinion of many others, national security experts, Republicans, former Republican members of Congress. But it’s in part because those of us who have had the great privilege of seeing this job up close and know how difficult it is, and it’s not just because I watched my husband take a $300 billion deficit and turn it into a $200 billion surplus, and 23 million new jobs were created, and incomes went up for everybody. Everybody. African-American incomes went up 33 percent."
COOPER, We have to move along.
CLINTON, Nine million people lost their jobs.
RADDATZ," Secretary Clinton, we have to…"
CLINTON, Five million homes were lost.
RADDATZ," Secretary Clinton, we’re moving on."
CLINTON, And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out. We are back on the right track. He would send us back into recession with his tax plans that benefit the wealthiest of Americans.
RADDATZ," Secretary Clinton, we are moving to an audience question. We’re almost out of time. We have another…"
TRUMP, We have the slowest growth since 1929.
RADDATZ," Mr. Trump, we’re moving to an audience question."
TRUMP, It is—our country has the slowest growth and jobs are a disaster.
RADDATZ," Mr. Trump, Secretary Clinton, we want to get to the audience. Thank you very much both of you. [laughter]"
QUESTION, Good evening. Perhaps the most important aspect of this election is the Supreme Court justice. What would you prioritize as the most important aspect of selecting a Supreme Court justice?
RADDATZ," We begin with your two minutes, Secretary Clinton."
CLINTON," Thank you. Well, you’re right. This is one of the most important issues in this election. I want to appoint Supreme Court justices who understand the way the world really works, who have real-life experience, who have not just been in a big law firm and maybe clerked for a judge and then gotten on the bench, but, you know, maybe they tried some more cases, they actually understand what people are up against."
RADDATZ," Thank you, Secretary Clinton. Thank you. You’re out of time. Mr. Trump?"
TRUMP," Justice Scalia, great judge, died recently. And we have a vacancy. I am looking to appoint judges very much in the mold of Justice Scalia. I’m looking for judges—and I’ve actually picked 20 of them so that people would see, highly respected, highly thought of, and actually very beautifully reviewed by just about everybody."
CLINTON, Well…[crosstalk]
RADDATZ, Thank you very much. We’re going to get on to one more question.
CLINTON," The question was about the Supreme Court. And I just want to quickly say, I respect the Second Amendment. But I believe there should be comprehensive background checks, and we should close the gun show loophole, and close the online loophole."
COOPER, Thank you.
RADDATZ," We have—we have one more question, Mrs. Clinton."
CLINTON, We have to save as many lives as we possibly can.
COOPER, We have one more question from Ken Bone about energy policy. Ken?
QUESTION," What steps will your energy policy take to meet our energy needs, while at the same time remaining environmentally friendly and minimizing job loss for fossil power plant workers?"
COOPER," Mr. Trump, two minutes?"
TRUMP," Absolutely. I think it’s such a great question, because energy is under siege by the Obama administration. Under absolutely siege. The EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, is killing these energy companies. And foreign companies are now coming in buying our—buying so many of our different plants and then re-jiggering the plant so that they can take care of their oil."
COOPER, Your time is up. Thank you.
TRUMP, It’s an absolute disgrace.
COOPER," Secretary Clinton, two minutes."
CLINTON," And actually—well, that was very interesting. First of all, China is illegally dumping steel in the United States and Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings, putting steelworkers and American steel plants out of business. That’s something that I fought against as a senator and that I would have a trade prosecutor to make sure that we don’t get taken advantage of by China on steel or anything else."
COOPER, Secretary Clinton…
CLINTON, But the price of coal is down worldwide. So we have to look at this comprehensively.
COOPER, Your time is up.
CLINTON, And that’s exactly what I have proposed. I hope you will go to HillaryClinton.com and look at my entire policy.
COOPER, Time is up. We have time for one more…
RADDATZ, We have…
COOPER, One more audience question.
RADDATZ," We’ve sneaked in one more question, and it comes from Karl Becker."
QUESTION," Good evening. My question to both of you is, regardless of the current rhetoric, would either of you name one positive thing that you respect in one another? [applause]"
RADDATZ," Mr. Trump, would you like to go first?"
CLINTON," Well, I certainly will, because I think that’s a very fair and important question. Look, I respect his children. His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald. I don’t agree with nearly anything else he says or does, but I do respect that. And I think that is something that as a mother and a grandmother is very important to me."
RADDATZ, Mr. Trump?
TRUMP," Well, I consider her statement about my children to be a very nice compliment. I don’t know if it was meant to be a compliment, but it is a great—I’m very proud of my children. And they’ve done a wonderful job, and they’ve been wonderful, wonderful kids. So I consider that a compliment."
RADDATZ, Thanks to both of you.
COOPER," We want to thank both the candidates. We want to thank the university here. This concludes the town hall meeting. Our thanks to the candidates, the commission, Washington University, and to everybody who watched."
RADDATZ, Good evening. I’m Martha Raddatz from ABC News.
WELKER," Good evening from Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee. I’m Kristen Welker of NBC News and I welcome you to the final 2020 presidential debate between President Donald J. Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden. Tonight’s debate is sponsored by The Commission on Presidential Debates. It is conducted under health and safety protocols designed by the commission’s health security advisor. The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent. No cheers, boos or other interruptions except right now, as we welcome to the stage former Vice President Joe Biden and President Donald J. Trump. "
TRUMP," So, as you know, 2.2 million people, modeled out, were expected to die. We closed up the greatest economy in the world in order to fight this horrible disease that came from China. It’s a worldwide pandemic. It’s all over the world. You see the spikes in Europe and many other places right now. If you notice, the mortality rate is down, 85%. The excess mortality rate is way down, and much lower than almost any other country. And we’re fighting it and we’re fighting it hard. There is a spike. There was a spike in Florida, and it’s now gone. There was a very big spike in Texas, it’s now gone. There was a very big spike in Arizona, it’s now gone. And there were some spikes and surges in other places. They will soon be gone. We have a vaccine that’s coming, it’s ready. It’s going to be announced within weeks, and it’s going to be delivered. We have Operation Warp Speed, which is the military, is going to distribute the vaccine. I can tell you from personal experience that I was in the hospital, I had it. And I got better and I will tell you that I had something that they gave me — a therapeutic, I guess they would call it. Some people could say it was a cure. But I was in for a short period of time and I got better very fast or I wouldn’t be here tonight. And now they say I’m immune. Whether it’s four months or a lifetime, nobody’s been able to say that, but I’m immune. More and more people are getting better. We have a problem that’s a worldwide problem. This is a worldwide problem, but I’ve been congratulated by the heads of many countries on what we’ve been able to do with the — if you take a look at what we’ve done in terms of goggles and masks and gowns and everything else, and in particular, ventilators. We’re now making ventilators. All over the world, thousands and thousands a month, distributing them all over the world, it will go away and as I say, we’re rounding the turn, we’re rounding the corner, it’s going away."
WELKER," OK, former Vice President Biden, to you, how would you lead the country out of this crisis? You have two minutes uninterrupted."
BIDEN," 220,000 Americans dead. If you hear nothing else I say tonight, hear this. Anyone who’s responsible for not taking control — in fact, not saying, I take no responsibility, initially — anyone who is responsible for that many deaths should not remain as President of the United States of America. We’re in a situation where there are thousands of deaths a day, a thousand deaths a day. And there are over 70,000 new cases per day. Compared to what’s going on in Europe, as the New England Medical Journal said, they’re starting from a very low rate. We’re starting from a very high rate. The expectation is we’ll have another 200,000 Americans dead by the time, between now and the end of the year. If we just wore these masks — the President’s own advisors have told him — we could save 100,000 lives. And we’re in a circumstance where the President, thus far, still has no plan. No comprehensive plan. What I would do is make sure we have everyone encouraged to wear a mask, all the time. I would make sure we move in the direction of rapid testing, investing in rapid testing. I would make sure that we set up national standards as to how to open up schools and open up businesses so they can be safe, and give them the wherewithal and financial resources to be able to do that. We’re in a situation now where the New England Medical Journal — one of the serious, most serious journals in the whole world — said for the first time ever that this, the way this President has responded to this crisis has been absolutely tragic. And so folks, I will take care of this, I will end this, I will make sure we have a plan."
WELKER," President Trump, I’d like to follow up with you and your comments. You talked about taking a therapeutic. I assume you’re referencing Regeneron. You also said a vaccine will be coming within weeks. Is that a guarantee?"
TRUMP," No, it’s not a guarantee but it will be by the end of the year, but I think it has a good chance. There are two companies, I think, within a matter of weeks, and it will be distributed very quickly."
WELKER, Can you tell us which companies?
TRUMP," Johnson and Johnson is doing very well. Moderna is doing very well. Pfizer is doing very well, and we have numerous others. And then we also have others that we’re working on very closely with other countries, in particular Europe."
WELKER," Let me follow up with you, and because this is new information — you have said a vaccine is coming soon, within weeks now. Your own officials say it could take well into 2021 at the earliest for enough Americans to get vaccinated, and even then they say the country will be wearing masks and distancing into 2022. Is your timeline realistic?"
TRUMP," No, I think my timeline is going to be more accurate. I don’t know that they’re counting on the military the way I do, but we have our generals lined up, one in particular, that’s the head of logistics. And this is a very easy distribution for him. He’s ready to go as soon as we have the vaccine, and we expect to have 100 million vials as soon as we have the vaccine, he’s ready to go."
WELKER," Vice President Biden, your reaction? Just 40% of Americans say they would definitely agree to take a coronavirus vaccine if it was approved by the government. What steps would you take to give Americans confidence in a vaccine if it were approved?"
BIDEN," Make sure it’s totally transparent. Have the scientific world see it, know it, look at it, go through all the processes. And by the way, this is the same fellow who told you this is going to end by Easter last time. This the same fellow who told you that, don’t worry, we’re going to end this by the summer. We’re about to go into a dark winter, a dark winter, and he has no clear plan and there’s no prospect that there’s going to be a vaccine available for the majority of the American people before the middle of next year."
WELKER," President Trump, your reaction? He says you have no plan."
TRUMP," I don’t think we’re going to have a dark winter at all. We’re opening up our country. We’ve learned and studied and understand the disease, which we didn’t at the beginning. When I closed and banned China from coming in heavily infected, and then ultimately Europe, but China was in January — months later he was saying I was xenophobic, I did it too soon. Now he’s saying, ‘Oh, I should have, I should have, you know, moved quicker.’ But he didn’t move quicker; he was months behind me, many months behind me. And frankly, he ran the H1N1 swine flu, and it was a total disaster. Far less lethal. But it was a total disaster. Had that had this kind of numbers, 700,000 people would be dead right now, but it was a far less lethal disease. Look, his own person who ran that for him who, as you know was his chief of staff, said ‘It was catastrophic, it was horrible, we didn’t know what we were doing.’ Now he comes up and he tells us how to do this. Also everything that he said about the way — every single move that he said we should make — that’s what we’ve done, we’ve done all of it, but he was way behind us."
WELKER," Vice President Biden, your response?"
BIDEN," My responses is, he is xenophobic but not because he shut down access from China. And he did it late, after 40 countries had already done that. In addition to that, what he did, he made sure that we had 44 people that were in there, in China, trying to get to Wuhan to determine what exactly the source was. What did the President say in January? He said no, he said, this is — he’s being transparent, the president of China is being transparent. We owe him a debt of gratitude. We have to thank him. And then what happened was, we started talking about using the Defense Act, to make sure we go out and get whatever is needed out there to protect people. And again, I go back to this, he had nothing. He did virtually nothing. And then he gets out of the hospital, and he talks about we’re, this is, ‘Oh, don’t worry. This is all going to be over soon.’ Come on, there’s not another serious scientist in the world who thinks it’s going to be over soon."
WELKER," President Trump, your reaction?"
TRUMP," I did not say over soon. I say we’re learning to live with it. We have no choice. We can’t lock ourselves up in a basement like Joe does. He has the ability to lock himself up. I don’t know, he’s obviously made a lot of money, someplace, but he has this thing about living in a basement. People can’t do that. By the way, I, as the president, couldn’t do that. I’d love to put myself in the basement or in a beautiful room in the White House and go away for a year and a half until it disappears. I can’t do that. And Kristen — every, every meeting I had — every meeting I had — and I’d meet a lot of families, including Gold Star families and military families, every meeting I had — and I had to meet them, I had to, it would be horrible to have canceled everything. I said, you know, this is dangerous. And you catch it. And you know, I caught it. I learned a lot. I learned a lot, great doctors, great hospitals. And now, I recovered. 99.9 of young people recover. 99% of people recover. We have to recover. We can’t close up our nation, we have to open our school, and we can’t close up our nation, or you’re not going to have a nation."
WELKER," And of course the CDC has said young people can get sick with COVID-19 and can pass it. Vice President Biden, I want to talk broadly about strategy, though."
BIDEN, Can I respond to that?
WELKER," 30 seconds please, and then I have a question."
BIDEN," Number one. He says that we’re, you know, we’re learning to live with it. People are learning to die with it. You folks home will have an empty chair at the kitchen table this morning. That man or wife going to bed tonight and reaching over to try to touch their, out of habit, where their wife or husband was, is gone. Learning to live with it? Come on. We’re dying with it, because he’s never said — he said it’s dangerous. When’s the last time? Is it really dangerous, still? Are we dangerous? You tell the people it’s dangerous now? What should they do about the danger? And you say, I take no responsibility."
WELKER, Let me talk about —
TRUMP, Excuse me.
WELKER, Very quickly.
TRUMP," I take full responsibility. It’s not my fault that it came here. It’s China’s fault. And you know what, it’s not Joe’s fault that it came here either. It’s China’s fault. They kept it from going into the rest of China, for the most part, but they didn’t keep it from coming out to the world including Europe and ourselves."
WELKER, Vice President Biden. 
BIDEN," The fact is, that when we knew it was coming, when it hit — what happened? What did the President say? He said don’t worry, it’s going to go away, be gone by Easter. Don’t worry, the warm weather. Don’t worry, maybe inject bleach — he said he was kidding when he said that, but a lot of people thought it was serious. A whole range of things the President said. And even today, he thinks we are in control. We’re about to lose 200,000 more people."
WELKER, President Trump.
TRUMP," Look, perhaps just to finish this, I was kidding on that but just to finish this. When I closed, he said, I shouldn’t have closed. And that went on for months. What Nancy Pelosi said the same thing. She was dancing on the streets in Chinatown in San Francisco. But when I closed, he said, this is a terrible thing. You’re xenophobic. I think he called me racist, even, and because I was closing it to China. Now he says I should have closed it earlier. It just, Joe, it doesn’t work."
BIDEN, I didn’t say either of those things.
TRUMP, You certainly did.
BIDEN, I talked about his xenophobia in a different context. It wasn’t about closing the border to Chinese coming to the United States.
WELKER," All right, I want to talk about both of your different strategies to handling this."
TRUMP, He thought I shouldn’t have closed the border. That’s obvious.
WELKER," Do you want to respond to that quickly, Vice President Biden?"
BIDEN, No.
WELKER," OK, let’s talk about your different strategies toward dealing with this. Mr. Vice President, you suggested you would support new shutdowns if scientists recommended it. What do you say to Americans who are fearful that the cost of shutdowns, the impact on the economy, the higher rates of hunger, depression, domestic and substance abuse, outweighs the risk of exposure to the virus?"
BIDEN," What I would say is I’m going to shut down the virus, not the country. It’s his ineptitude that caused the country to have to shut down in large part — why businesses have gone under, why schools are closed, why so many people have lost their living and why they’re concerned. Those other concerns are real. That’s why he should have been — instead of in a sand trap at his golf course — he should have been negotiating with Nancy Pelosi and the rest of the Democrats and Republicans about what to do about the acts they were passing for billions of dollars to make sure people had the capacity."
WELKER, Well you haven’t ruled out more shutdowns.
BIDEN," Oh no, I’m not shutting down the nation but there are, look, they need standards. The standard is, if you have a reproduction rate in a community that’s above a certain level, everybody says, slow up. More social distancing. Do not open bars and do not open gymnasiums. Do not open until you get this under control, under more control. But when you do open, give the people the capacity to be able to open and have the capacity to do it safely. For example schools — schools, they need a lot of money to open. They need to deal with ventilation systems, they need to deal with smaller classes, more teachers, more pods, and he’s refused to support that money, or at least up to now."
WELKER, Let’s talk about schools. President Trump —
TRUMP," Well, I think we have to respond, if I might."
WELKER," Please, and then I have a follow up."
TRUMP," Thank you, and I appreciate that. Look, all he does is talk about shutdowns but forget about him. His democrat governors — Cuomo in New York, you look at what’s going on in California, you look at Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Democrats, Democrats all — they are shut down so tight, and they’re dying. They’re dying. And he supports all these people. All he talks about is shutdowns. No, we’re not going to shut down, and we have to open our schools. And it’s like, as an example, I have a young son. He also tested positive. By the time I spoke to the doctor, the second time, he was fine, it just went away. Young people, I guess it’s their immune system."
WELKER," Let me follow up with you, President Trump. You’ve demanded schools open in person and insisted they can do it safely. But just yesterday, Boston became the latest city to move its public school system entirely online after a coronavirus spike. What is your message to parents who worry that sending their children to school will endanger not only their kids, but also their teachers and families?"
TRUMP," I want to open the schools. The transmittal rate to the teachers is very small, but I want to open the schools. We have to open our country. We’re not going to have a country. You can’t do this, we can’t keep this country closed. It is a massive country with a massive economy. People are losing their jobs, they’re committing suicide. There’s depression, alcohol, drugs at a level that nobody’s ever seen before. There’s abuse, tremendous abuse. We have to open our country. You know I’ve said it often — the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself, and that’s what’s happening, and he wants to close down. He’ll close down the country if one person in our, in our massive bureaucracy says we should close it down."
WELKER," Vice President Biden, your response. "
BIDEN," Simply not true. We’re gonna be able to walk and chew gum at the same time. We ought to be able to safely open, but they need resources to open. You need to be able to, for example, if you’re gonna open a business, have social distancing within the business. You need to have, if you have a restaurant, you need to have plexiglass dividers so people cannot infect one another. You need to be in a position where you can take testing rapidly and know whether a person is, in fact, infected. You need to be able to trace. You need to be able to provide all the resources that are needed to do this and that is not inconsistent with saying that we’re going to make sure that we open safely. And by the way, all you teachers out there — not that many of you are going to die, so don’t worry about it. Don’t worry about it. Come on."
WELKER," President Trump, let me follow up with you quickly."
TRUMP," By the way, I will say this, if you go and look at what’s happened to New York, it’s a ghost town. It’s a ghost town. And when you talk about plexiglass — these are restaurants that are dying. These are businesses with no money. Putting up plexiglass is unbelievably expensive, and it’s not the answer. I mean, you’re going to sit there in a cubicle wrapped around with plastic? These are businesses that are dying, Joe, you can’t do that to people, you just can’t. Take a look at New York and what’s happened to my wonderful city. For so many years, I loved it. It was vibrant. It’s dying. Everyone’s leaving New York."
WELKER, Vice President Biden.
BIDEN," Take a look at what New York has done in terms of turning the curve down, in terms of the number of people dying. And I don’t look at this in terms of the way he does, blue states and red states. They’re all the United States. And look at the states that are having such a spike in the coronavirus. They’re the red states. They are the states in the Midwest, they are the states in the upper Midwest, that’s where the spike is occurring significantly, but they’re all Americans. They’re all Americans and what we have to do is say, wear these masks, number one, make sure we get the help that the businesses need. The money’s already been passed to do that. It’s been out there since the beginning of the summer and nothing’s happened."
TRUMP," Kristen, New York has lost more than 40,000 people. 11,000 people in nursing homes."
WELKER," President Trump, what about —"
TRUMP," When you say spike, take a look at what’s happening in Pennsylvania, where they’ve had it closed. Take a look at what’s happening with your friend in Michigan, where her husband’s the only one allowed to do anything. It’s been like a prison. Now it was just ruled unconstitutional. Take a look at North Carolina. They’re having spikes and they’ve been closed, and they’re getting killed financially. We can’t let that happen, Joe, you can’t let that happen. We have to open up and we understand the disease, we have to protect our seniors, we have to protect our elderly, we have to protect, especially, our seniors with heart problems and diabetes problems, and we will protect them. We have the best testing in the world by far. That’s why we have so many cases."
WELKER," Let me follow up with you before we move on to our next section. President Trump, this week you called Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s best known infectious disease expert, “a disaster.” You described him and other medical experts as “idiots.” If you’re not listening to them, who are you listening to?"
TRUMP," I’m listening to all of them, including Anthony. I get along very well with Anthony. But he did say, ‘don’t wear masks.’ He did say, as you know, ‘this is not going to be a problem.’ I think he’s a Democrat, but that’s okay. He said, ‘this is not going to be a problem. We are not going to have a problem at all.’ When Joe says that, I said — Anthony Fauci said and others and many others. And I’m not knocking him. Nobody knew. Look, nobody knew what this thing was, nobody knew where it was coming from, what it was. We’ve learned a lot, but Anthony said, ‘don’t wear masks.’ Now he wants to wear masks. Anthony also said, if you look back, exact words, here’s his exact words: ‘This is no problem, this is going to go away soon.’ So he’s allowed to make mistakes, he happens to be a good person."
WELKER," Vice President Biden, your response, quickly and then we’re going to move on to the next section."
BIDEN," My response is that, think about what the President knew in January and didn’t tell the American people. He was told this was a serious virus that spread in the air, and it was much worse than — much worse — than the flu. He went on record and said to one of your colleagues, recorded, that in fact he knew how dangerous it was but he didn’t want to tell us, didn’t want to tell us because he didn’t want us to panic. He didn’t want us — Americans don’t panic. He panicked. But, guess what, in the meantime, we find out in the New York Times the other day that in fact, his folks went to Wall Street and said, ‘this is a really dangerous thing,’ and a memo out of that meeting — not from his administration, but from some of the brokers — said, ‘sell short, because we gotta get moving. It’s a dangerous problem.’"
TRUMP, Well this is —
WELKER, I’m going to give you 30 seconds to respond and then we’re gonna move on.
TRUMP," I don’t know, somebody went to Wall Street. You’re the one that takes all the money from Wall Street. I don’t take it. You have raised a lot of money, tremendous amounts of money. And every time you raise money, deals are made, Joe. I could raise so much more money. As president and as somebody that knows most of those people, I could call the heads of Wall Street, the heads of every company in America, I would blow away every record. But I don’t want to do that because it puts me in a bad position. And then you bring up Wall Street? You shouldn’t be bringing up Wall Street. Because you’re the one that takes the money from Wall Street, not me. I could blow away your records like you wouldn’t believe. We don’t need money. We have plenty of money. In fact, we beat Hillary Clinton with a tiny fraction of the money that she was able to get. Don’t tell me about Wall Street."
WELKER," All right, gentlemen, we’re gonna move on."
BIDEN," Average contribution, $43."
WELKER," All right, we’re gonna move on to our next section which is national security. And I do want to start with the security of our elections and some breaking news from overnight. Just last night, top intelligence officials confirmed again that both Russia and Iran are working to influence this election. Both countries have obtained U.S. voter registration information, these officials say, and Iran sent intimidating messages to Florida voters. This question goes to you, Mr. Vice President, what would you do to put an end to this threat? You have two minutes, uninterrupted."
BIDEN," I made it clear. And I asked everyone else to take the pledge. I made it clear that any country, no matter who it is, that interferes in American elections will pay a price. They will pay a price. It has been overwhelmingly clear in this election — I won’t even get into the last one — this election, that Russia has been involved. China has been involved to some degree, and now we learned that, that Iran is involved. They will pay a price if I’m elected. They’re interfering with American sovereignty. That’s what’s going on right now. They’re interfering with American sovereignty. And to the best of my knowledge, I don’t think the President has said anything to Putin about it. I don’t think he’s talking to him a lot. I don’t think he’s said a word. I don’t know why he hasn’t said a word to Putin about it. And I don’t know what he has recently said, if anything, to the Iranians. My guess is he’d probably be more outspoken with regard to the Iranians. But the point is this, folks. We are in a situation where we have foreign countries trying to interfere in the outcome of our election. His own national security advisor told him that what is happening with his buddy — well, I won’t, I shouldn’t — I will — his buddy Rudy Giuliani. He’s being used as a Russian pawn. He’s being fed information that is Russian, that is not true. And then what happens? Nothing happens. And then you find out that everything is going on here about Russia is wanting to make sure that I do not get elected the next President of the United States because they know I know them, and they know me. I don’t understand why this President is unwilling to take on Putin when he’s actually paying bounties to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan, when he’s engaged in activities that are trying to destabilize all of NATO. I don’t know why he doesn’t do it but it’s worth asking the question. Why isn’t that being done? Any country that interferes with us will, in fact, pay a price because they’re affecting our sovereignty."
WELKER," President Trump, same question to you. Let me, let me ask the question. You’re gonna have two minutes to respond for two elections in a row now there has been substantial interference from foreign adversaries. What would you do in your next term to put an end to this? Two minutes, uninterrupted."
TRUMP," Well, let me respond to the first part, as Joe answered. Joe got three and a half million dollars from Russia. And it came through Putin, because he was very friendly with the former mayor of Moscow and it was the mayor of Moscow’s wife. You got three and a half million dollars. Your family got three and a half million dollars and you know someday, you’re gonna have to explain — why did you get three and a half? I never got any money from Russia. I don’t get money from Russia. Now, about your thing last night, I knew all about that, and through John — who is John Radcliffe, who is fantastic, DNI — he said, the one thing that’s common to both of them, they both want you to lose. Because there has been nobody tougher to Russia. Between the sanctions, nobody tougher than me on Russia. Between the sanctions between all of what I’ve done with NATO. You know, I’ve got the NATO countries to put up an extra 130 billion, going to $420 billion a year, that’s to guard against Russia. I sold — while he was selling pillows and sheets — I sold tank busters to Ukraine. There has been nobody tougher on Russia than Donald Trump. And I’ll tell you, they were so bad. They took over the, the submarine port. You remember that very well during your term, during you and Barack Obama. They took over a big part of what should have been Ukraine. You handed it to them. But you were getting a lot of money from Russia. They were paying you a lot of money and they probably still are, but now, with what came out today, it’s even worse. All of the emails, the emails are horrible. The emails of the kind of money that you were raking in, you and your family. And Joe, you were vice president when some of this was happening. And it should have never happened. And I think you owe an explanation to the American people. Why is it, somebody just had a news conference a little while ago, who was essentially supposed to work with you and your family, but what he said was damning. And regardless of me, I think you have to clean it up and talk to the American people. Maybe you can do it right now."
WELKER," Vice President Biden, you may respond and then I do want to follow up on the election security."
BIDEN," I have not taken a penny from any foreign source ever in my life. We learn that this President paid 50 times the tax in China, has a secret bank account with China, does business in China, and in fact, is talking about me taking money? I have not taken a single penny from any country whatsoever, ever, number one. Number two, this is a president — I have released all of my tax returns. 22 years. Go look at them. 22 years of my tax returns. You have not released a single solitary year of your tax return. What are you hiding? Why are you unwilling? The foreign countries are paying you a lot. Russia is paying you a lot. China is paying a lot. And your hotels and all your businesses all around the country, all around the world. And China’s building a new road to a new gas… a golf course you have overseas. So what’s going on here? Why don’t you release your tax return or stop talking about corruption?"
WELKER," President Trump, your response."
TRUMP," First of all, I called my accountants — under audit. I’m going to release them as soon as we can. I want to do it, and it will show how successful, how great this company is. But much more importantly than that, people were saying $750. I asked them a week ago, I said, what did I pay? They said, sir, you pre-paid tens of millions of dollars. I prepaid my tax. Tens. Over the last number of years. Tens of millions of dollars, I prepaid, because at some point, they think, it’s an estimate. They think I may have to pay tax. So, I already prepaid it. Nobody told me that."
WELKER, Did your accountant tell you —
TRUMP," Excuse me. And it wasn’t written whenever they write this. They keep talking about $750, which I think is a filing fee. But let me just tell you, I prepaid millions and millions of dollars in taxes, number one. Number two, I don’t make money from China, you do. I don’t make money from Ukraine, you do. I don’t make money from Russia. You made three and a half million dollars, Joe, and your son gave you. They even have a statement that we have to give 10% to the big man. You’re the big man, I think. I don’t know, maybe you’re not. But you’re the big man, I think. Your son said we have to give 10% to the big man. Joe, what’s that all about? It’s terrible."
WELKER," Alright, gentlemen, I want to ask you both some questions about all of this. I’m gonna let you both respond, very quickly. You just said you spoke to your accountant about potentially releasing your taxes. Did he tell you when you can release them? Do you have a deadline for when you’re going to release them to the American people?"
TRUMP," I get treated worse than the Tea Party got treated. A lot of people in there, deep down in the IRS, they treat me horribly. We made a deal, it was all settled, until I decided to run for president. I get treated very badly by the IRS, very unfairly, but we had a deal all done. As soon as we’re completed with the deal, I want to release it. But I have paid millions and millions of dollars. And it’s worse than paying. I paid in advance. It’s called prepaying your taxes. "
WELKER, I want to ask you both about questions regarding your potential foreign entanglements and questions that have been raised to give you both a chance to talk about this more broadly.
BIDEN, At some point I want to respond.
WELKER," Respond very quickly, and then I’ll get to my question."
BIDEN," Why do he — He’s been saying this for four years. Show us. Just show us. Stop playing around. You’ve been saying for four years you’re going to release your taxes. Nobody knows, Mr. President, what they do know is you’re not paying your taxes or you’re paying taxes that are so low. When last time he said what he paid, he said, ‘I only pay that little because I’m smart. I know how to game the system.’ Come on, come on, folks."
WELKER," Quickly, President Trump, and then I want to get to two questions to both of you."
TRUMP," I was put through a phony witch hunt for three years. It started before I even got elected. They spied on my campaign. No president should ever have to go through what I went through. Let me just say this. Mueller and 18 angry Democrats, and FBI agents all over the place spent $48 million. They went through everything I had, including my tax returns, and they found absolutely no collusion and nothing wrong. $48 million. I guarantee you, if I spent 1 million on you Joe, I could find plenty wrong, because the kind of things that you’ve done and the kind of monies that your family has taken — I mean, your brother made money in Iraq, millions of dollars. Your other brother made a fortune, and it’s all through you, Joe. And they say you get some of it. And you do live very well. You have houses all over the place. You live very well."
WELKER," All right, gentlemen, let me just ask some questions about all of this broadly. Vice President Biden, there have been questions about the work your son has done in China, and for a Ukrainian energy company when you were Vice President. In retrospect, was anything about those relationships inappropriate or unethical?"
BIDEN," Nothing was unethical. Here’s what the deal. With regard to Ukraine, we had this whole question about whether or not, because he was on the board, I later learned, of Burisma, a company, that somehow I had done something wrong. Yet every single solitary person, when he was going through his impeachment, testifying under oath who worked for him, said I did my job impeccably. I carried out US policy. Not one, single, solitary thing was out of line. Not a single thing, number one. Number two, the guy who got in trouble in Ukraine was this guy, trying to bribe the Ukrainian government to say something negative about me, which they would not do, and did not do, because it never, ever, ever happened. My son has not made money in terms of this thing about — what are you talking about — China. I have not had it. The only guy that made money from China is this guy. He’s the only one. Nobody else has made money from China."
WELKER," President Trump, let me ask my question to you."
TRUMP, Could I just — one thing.
WELKER, Very quickly.
TRUMP," His son didn’t have a job for a long time, was sadly no longer in the military service, I won’t get into that. And he didn’t have a job. As soon as he became vice president, Burisma — not the best, not the best reputation in the world — I hear they paid him 183,000 a month. Listen to this, 183, and they gave him a $3 million upfront payment, and he had no energy experience. That’s 100% dishonest."
WELKER, I’m going to let the vice president respond to that quickly and then I have a question for you.
BIDEN," No basis for that. Everybody investigated that, no one said anything he did was wrong in Ukraine."
WELKER," OK, President Trump, this is for you. Since you took office, you’ve never divested from your business. You’ve personally promoted your properties abroad. A report this week, which was referenced, does indicate that your company has a bank account in China. So how can voters know that you don’t have any foreign conflicts of interest?"
TRUMP," I have many bank accounts and they’re all listed and they’re all over the place. I mean, I was a businessman doing business. The bank account you’re referring to — which is, everybody knows about it, it’s listed — the bank account was in 2013. That’s what it was. It was opened. It was closed in 2015, I believe, and then I decided, because I was going to do, I was thinking about doing a deal in China, like millions of other people, I was thinking about it. And I decided I’m not going to do it, didn’t like it, I decided not to do it, had an account open and I closed it."
WELKER, OK.
TRUMP," Excuse me, and then unlike him, where he’s Vice President, and he does business, I then decided to run for president after that. That was before. So I closed it before I even ran for president, let alone became president, big difference. He is the Vice President of the United States, and his son, his brother and his other brother are getting rich, they’re like a vacuum cleaner, there’s something —"
WELKER," Okay, President Trump, thank you. We do need to move on. I do want to ask you, Vice President Biden, about China. Let’s talk about China more broadly. There have, of course, President Trump has said that they should pay for not being fully transparent in regards to the coronavirus. If you were president, would you make China pay and please be specific, what would that look like?"
BIDEN," What I’d make China do is play by the international rules, not like he has done. He has caused the deficit in China to go up not down — with China, up not down. We are making sure that in order to do business in China, you have to give all your intellectual property. You have to get/have a partner in China, it is 51%. We would not do that at all, number one. Number two, we’re in a situation where China would have to play by the rules internationally as well. When I met with Xi, and when I was still vice president, he said ‘we’re setting up air identification zones in the South China Sea, you can’t fly through them.’ I said, ‘we’re gonna fly through them. We just flew B52/B1 bombers through it. We’re not going to pay attention.’ They have to play by the rules, and what’s he do? He embraces guys like the thugs like in North Korea, and, and, and the Chinese president and Putin and others, and he pokes his finger in the eye of all our friends, all of our allies. We make up only — we’re 25%. 25% of the world’s economy. We need to be having the rest of our friends with us, saying to China, these are the rules. You play by them or you’re going to pay the price for not playing by them, economically. That’s the way I will run it. And that’s what we did and upholding steel tariffs and a range of other things when we were president and vice president."
WELKER," All right, let’s talk about North Korea."
TRUMP," Excuse me, no, I have to respond to this."
WELKER," OK, very quickly and then we’re gonna move on to North Korea…"
TRUMP, His son walked out with a billion and a half dollars from China —
BIDEN, Not true.
TRUMP," — after spending 10 minutes in office and being in Air Force Two, number one. Number two, there’s a very strong email, talking about your family wanting to make $10 million a year for introductions."
BIDEN, That is not true.
WELKER," President Trump, on China policy, though. What are you gonna do? What specifically are you going to do to make China pay? You’ve said you’re going to make them pay."
TRUMP," First of all, China is paying. They’re paying billions and billions of dollars. I just gave $28 billion."
WELKER, New sanctions?
TRUMP, I just gave $28 billion to our farmers.
BIDEN, Taxpayers money.
TRUMP, It’s what?
BIDEN, Taxpayers money.
TRUMP," No, you know who the taxpayer is. It’s called China."
BIDEN, Not true.
TRUMP," China paid $28 billion and you know what they did to pay it, Joe? They devalued their currency and they also paid up, and you know who got the money? Our farmers. Our great farmers, because they were targeted. You never charge them anything. Also, I charged them 25% on dumped steel, because they were killing our steel industry. We were not going to have a steel industry, and now we have a steel industry."
WELKER," OK, Vice President Biden, your response, please?"
BIDEN," My response is look, this isn’t about – there’s a reason why he’s bringing up all this malarkey. There’s a reason for it. He doesn’t want to talk about the substantive issues. It’s not about his family and my family. It’s about your family, and your family’s hurting badly. If you’re making less than, if you’re a middle class family, you’re getting hurt badly right now. You’re sitting at the kitchen table this morning deciding, well, we can’t get new tires, they’re bald, because we have to wait another month or so. Or are we going to be able to pay the mortgage? Who’s going to tell her, she can’t go back to community college? They’re the decisions you’re making in the middle class families like I grew up in Scranton and Claymont. They’re in trouble. We should be talking about your families but that’s the last thing he wants to talk about."
WELKER, I want to talk about North Korea – 
TRUMP," That is a typical statement. Excuse me, just for one second, please. "
WELKER," 10 seconds, Mr. President, 10 seconds."
TRUMP," That’s a typical political statement. Let’s get off this China thing, and then he looks — the family, around the table, everything. Just a typical politician when I see that."
WELKER," Alright, let’s talk —"
TRUMP," I’m not a typical politician, that’s why I got elected."
WELKER, Let’s talk about —
TRUMP," Let’s get off the subject of China, let’s talk around sitting around the table. Come on, Joe, you can do better."
WELKER," We’re gonna talk about North Korea now. President Trump, you’ve met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un three times. You’ve talked about your beautiful letters with him, you’ve touted the fact that there hasn’t been a war or a long range missile test, and yet North Korea recently rolled out its biggest ever intercontinental ballistic missile and continues to develop its nuclear arsenal. Do you see that as a betrayal of the relationship you forged? Just 30 seconds here because we need to get on to the next topic."
TRUMP," So, when I met with Barack Obama, we sat in the White House, right at the beginning had a great conversation, was supposed to be 15 minutes and it was well over an hour. He said the biggest problem we have is North Korea. He indicated we will be in a war with North Korea. Guess what, it would be a nuclear war, and he does have plenty of nuclear capability. In the meantime, I have a very good relationship with him, different kind of a guy but he probably thinks the same thing about me. We have a different kind of a relationship. We have a very good relationship, and there’s no war. And you know, about two months ago, he broke into a certain area. They said, ‘oh there’s going to be trouble.’ I said, ‘No, they’re not. Because he’s not going to do that.’ And I was right. Look, instead of being in a war where millions of people — Seoul, you know, is 25 miles away, millions and millions, 32 million people in Seoul — millions of people would be dead right now. We don’t have a war, and I have a good relationship."
WELKER," Vice President Biden to you, North Korea conducted four nuclear tests under the Obama administration. Why do you think you would be able to rein in this persistent threat?"
BIDEN," Because I’d make it clear, which we were making clear to China, they had to be part of the deal, because here’s the root. I made it clear, as a spokesperson for the administration when I went to China, that they said, ‘Why are you moving your missile defense up so close? Why are you moving more forces here? Why are you continuing to do military maneuvers with South Korea?’ I said, ‘Because North Korea is a problem. And we’re going to continue to do it so we can control them. We’re going to make sure we can control them and make sure they cannot hurt us. And so if you want to do something about it, step up and help. If not, it’s going to continue.’ What has he done? He’s legitimized North Korea, he’s talked about his good buddy who’s a thug, a thug, and he talks about how we’re better off, and they have much more capable missiles, able to reach U.S. territory, much more easily than ever did before."
WELKER," Let me follow up with you, Vice President Biden, you’ve said you wouldn’t meet with Kim Jong Un without preconditions. Are there any conditions under which you would meet with him?"
BIDEN, On the condition that he would agree that he would be drawing down his nuclear capacity to get – the Korean Peninsula should be a nuclear free zone.
WELKER," Alright, let’s move on to American families."
TRUMP," Kristen, they tried to meet with him."
WELKER," Very quickly. 10 seconds, President Trump."
TRUMP," They tried to meet with him, he wouldn’t do it. He didn’t like Obama. He didn’t like him. He wouldn’t do it."
WELKER," OK, I’ve got to give him a chance to respond."
TRUMP," They tried, he wouldn’t do it. And that’s okay. You know what, North Korea, we’re not in a war. We have a good relationship. You know, people don’t understand — having a good relationship with leaders of other countries is a good thing."
WELKER," President Trump, we have to move on. We have a lot of questions to get through."
BIDEN," We had a good relationship with Hitler before he in fact invaded Europe, the rest of Europe. Come on. The reason he would not meet with President Obama is because President Obama said we’re gonna talk about denuclearization, we’re not gonna legitimize you, we’re gonna continue to put stronger and stronger sanctions on you. That’s why he wouldn’t meet with us."
TRUMP, And it didn’t happen.
WELKER, Let’s move on and talk about American families.
TRUMP," Excuse me, he left me a mess, Kristen. They left me a mess. North Korea was a mess."
WELKER," We need to move on so that we have time to get to all our questions tonight, President Trump."
TRUMP," Remember the first two or three months. There was a very dangerous period in my first three months, before we sort of worked things out a little bit. They left us a mess, and Obama would be – I think, the first to say — it was the single biggest problem, he thought, that our country had."
WELKER," Okay, let’s move on to American families and the economy. One of the issues that’s most important to them is health care, as you both know. Today, there was a key vote on a new Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett, and healthcare is at the center of her confirmation fight. Over 20 million Americans get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. It’s headed to the Supreme Court, and your administration, Mr. President, is advocating for the court to overturn it. If the Supreme Court does overturn that law, those 20 million Americans could lose their health insurance almost overnight. So what would you do if those people have their health insurance taken away? You have two minutes uninterrupted."
TRUMP," First of all, I’ve already done something that nobody thought was possible. Through the legislature, I terminated the individual mandate. That is the worst part of Obamacare, as we call it. The individual mandate – where you have to pay a fortune for the privilege of not having to pay for bad health insurance. I terminated it; it’s gone. Now it’s in court, because Obamacare is no good. But then I made a decision, ‘Run it as well as you can’ — to my people, great people — ‘Run it as well as you can.’ I could have gone the other route and made everybody very unhappy. They ran it. Premiums are down, everything’s down. Here’s the problem. No matter how well you run it, it’s no good. What we’d like to do is terminate it. We have the individual mandate done. I don’t know that it’s going to work. If we don’t win, we will have to run it and we’ll have Obamacare, but it will be better run. But it no longer is Obamacare. Because without the individual mandate, it’s much different. Pre-existing conditions will always stay. What I would like to do is a much better health care, much better. We’ll always protect people with pre-existing — so I’d like to terminate Obamacare, come up with a brand new beautiful health care. The Democrats will do it because there’ll be tremendous pressure on them. And we might even have the House by that time. And I think we’re going to win the House, okay? You’ll see, but I think we’re gonna win the House. But come up with a better health care, always protecting people with pre-existing conditions — and one thing very important. We have 180 million people out there that have great private health care, far more than we’re talking about with Obamacare. Joe Biden is going to terminate all of those policies. These are people that love their health care, people that have been successful — middle income people — been successful. They have 180 million plans, 180 million people, families under what he wants to do, which will basically be socialized medicine. He won’t even have a choice. They want to terminate 180 million plans. We have done an incredible job on health care. And we’re going to do even better."
WELKER," OK. Vice President Biden, yes, this is for you. Your health care plan calls for building on Obamacare. So my question is, what is your plan if the law is ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court? You have two minutes uninterrupted."
BIDEN," What I’m going to do is pass Obamacare with a public option — become Bidencare. Public option is an option that says that if you, in fact, do not have the wherewithal to be — if you qualify for Medicaid, and you do not have the wherewithal in your state to get Medicaid, you automatically are enrolled, providing competition for insurance companies. That’s what’s going to happen. Secondly, we’re going to make sure we reduce the premiums and reduce drug prices by making sure that there’s competition that doesn’t exist now by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices with the insurance companies. Thirdly, the idea that I want to eliminate private insurance — the reason why I had such a fight for, with 20 candidates for the nomination, was I support private insurance. That’s why I did not — not one single person, private insurance, would lose their insurance under my plan, nor did they under Obamacare. They did not lose their insurance, unless they chose they wanted to go to something else. Lastly, we’re going to make sure we’re in a situation that we actually protect pre-existing — there’s no way he can protect pre-existing conditions. None, zero, you can’t do it in the ether. He’s been talking about this for a long time. There is no — he’s never come up with a plan. I guess we’re gonna get the pre-existing condition plan the same time we get the infrastructure plan that we waited since 17, 18, 19, 20. The fact  — I still have a little, a few more minutes, I know you’re getting anxious — the fact is that he’s already cost the American people because of his terrible handling of the COVID virus and economic spillover. 10 million people have lost their private insurance, and he wants to take away 22 million more people who have been under Obamacare, and over 110 million people with pre-existing conditions. And all the people from COVID are going to have pre-existing conditions. What are they gonna do?"
WELKER," I have a follow up for you, Vice President Biden, it relates to something that President Trump said. He’s accusing you of wanting socialized medicine. What do you say to people who have concerns that your health care plan, which includes a government insurance option, takes the country one step closer to a health care system run entirely by the government? What’s your response to that?"
BIDEN," I say, it’s ridiculous. It’s like saying that, you know, we’re the idea that, the fact that there’s a public option that people can choose, that makes it a socialist plan? Look, the difference between the president — I think health care is not a privilege, it’s a right. Everyone should have the right to have affordable health care. And I am very proud of my plan. It’s gotten endorsed by all the major labor unions as well as, as well as a whole range of other people who in fact, are concerned in the medical field. This is something that’s going to save people’s lives. And this is going to give some people an opportunity, an opportunity to have health care for their children, how many of you home are worried and rolling around in bed at night wondering what in God’s name are you going to do if you get sick? Because you’ve lost your home insurance, your health insurance, your company’s gone under. We have to provide health insurance for people at an affordable rate, and that’s what I’d do."
WELKER," President Trump, your response."
TRUMP," Excuse me, he was there for 47 years — he didn’t do it. He was now there as Vice President for eight years. And it’s not like it was 25 years ago, it was three and three quarters. It was just a little while ago, right? Less than four years ago. He didn’t do anything. He didn’t do it. He wants socialized medicine. And it’s not that he wants it, his vice president — I mean, she is more liberal than Bernie Sanders and wants it even more. Bernie Sanders wants it, the Democrats want it. You’re going to have socialized medicine. Just like you went on with fracking — ‘We’re not going to have fracking, we’re going to stop fracking, we’re going to stop fracking.’ Then he goes to Pennsylvania after he gets the nomination — where he got very lucky to get it. And he goes to Pennsylvania, and he says, ‘Oh, we’re gonna have fracking.’ And you never asked that question. And by the way, so far, I respect very much the way you’re handling this, I have to say. But somebody should ask the question. He goes for a year —"
WELKER, We do have a number of — we have a number of topics – 
TRUMP," No, no, but that’s a big question —"
WELKER, We’re gonna get to it —
TRUMP, It’s the same thing with socialized medicine.
WELKER," Vice President, your response please."
BIDEN," My response is people deserve to have affordable health care — period. Period, period, period. And the Bidencare proposal will, in fact, provide for that affordable health care, lower premiums. What we’re going to do is going to cost some money; it’s going to cost over $750 billion over 10 years to do it. And they’re going to have lower premiums, you can buy into the better plans, the cheaper plans, lower your premiums, deal with unexpected billing, and have your drug prices drop significantly. He keeps talking about it. He hasn’t done a thing for anybody on health care, not a thing."
TRUMP," Kristen, when he says —"
WELKER," Very quickly, then I want to talk about what’s happening on Capitol Hill. "
TRUMP," When he says public option, he is talking about socialized medicine and health care. When he talks about a public option, he’s talking about destroying your Medicare, totally destroying — and destroying your Social Security. And this whole country will come down. You know, Bernie Sanders tried it in his state. He tried it in his state. His governor was a very liberal governor, they wanted to make it work —"
WELKER, Let’s see if —
TRUMP," — it was impossible to work, it doesn’t work —"
WELKER," Vice President Biden, your response."
BIDEN," He’s a very confused guy, he thinks he’s running against somebody else. He’s running against Joe Biden. I beat all those other people because I disagreed with them. Joe Biden, he’s running against. And the idea that we’re in a situation and are going to destroy Medicare — this is the guy that the actuary of Medicare said, ‘If in fact’ — and, social security — ‘If, in fact, he continues to withhold his plan to withhold the tax on Social Security, Social Security will be bankrupt by 2023, with no way to make up for it. This is a guy who’s tried to cut Medicare. So I don’t know. I mean, the idea that Donald Trump is lecturing me on Social Security and Medicare? Come on."
TRUMP, He tried to get rid of —
WELKER," Ten seconds, Mr. President, then I have to go to another question —"
TRUMP," — he tried to hurt Social Security years ago, years ago. Go back and look at the records. He tried to hurt Social Security years ago. One thing —"
WELKER," Alright, let’s move on. Mr. President I have to move on to the next question."
TRUMP," They say the stock market will boom if I’m elected. If he’s elected, the stock market will crash."
WELKER," OK, let’s move on to the next question."
BIDEN, May I respond?
WELKER, Very quickly.
BIDEN," The idea that the stock market is booming is his only measure of what’s happening. Where I come from, in Scranton and Claymont, the people don’t live off of the stock market. Just in the last three, three years during this crisis, the billionaires in this country made, according to the Wall Street, $700 billion more dollars. $700 billion more dollars. Because that’s his only measure. What happens to the ordinary people out there? What happens to them?"
TRUMP, 401k’s are through the roof. People’s stock are through the roof —
WELKER, We’re going to move on.
TRUMP," And he doesn’t come from Scranton. That’s like, what — he lived there for a short period of time before he even knew —"
WELKER, We’re gonna move on —
TRUMP, And he left. And the people of Pennsylvania will show you that.
WELKER," — to my next question, gentlemen. As of tonight, more than 12 million people are out of work. And as of tonight, 8 million more Americans have fallen into poverty, and more families are going hungry every day. Those hit hardest are women and people of color. They see Washington fighting over a relief bill. Mr. President, why haven’t you been able to get them the help they need? 30 seconds here."
TRUMP, Because Nancy Pelosi doesn’t want to approve it. I do.
WELKER, But you’re the president.
TRUMP," I do. But I still have to get, unfortunately — that’s one of the reasons I think we’re going to take over the House, because of her. Nancy Pelosi doesn’t want to approve anything. Because she’d love to have some victories on a date called November 3rd. Nancy Pelosi does not want to approve it. We are ready, willing and able to do something. Don’t forget, we’ve already approved three plans. And it’s gone through, including the Democrats, in all fairness. This one she doesn’t want. It’s near the election, because she thinks it helps her politically. I think it hurts her politically."
WELKER," Alright, Mr. Vice President —"
BIDEN," You know, the Republican leader in the United States Senate said he can’t pass it — he will not be able to pass it. He does not have Republican votes. Why isn’t he talking to his Republican friends?"
WELKER," Let me follow up with you, Vice President Biden – "
TRUMP," If we made a deal, the Republicans would pass it —"
WELKER, Let me ask Vice President Biden a question. You are the leader of the Democratic Party. Why have you not pushed the Democrats to get a deal for the American people?
BIDEN," Well, I have and they have pushed it. Look, they passed this act all the way back in the beginning of the summer. This is like — it’s not new. It’s been out there. This HEROES Act has been sitting there. And look at what’s happening. When I was in charge of the Recovery Act with $800 billion, I was able to get $145 billion to local communities that have to balance their budget to states that have to balance their budgets, so then they have to fire fire — they have to fire firefighters, teachers, first responders, law enforcement officers, so they could keep their cities and counties running. He will not support that. They have not done a thing for them. And Mitch McConnell said, ‘Let him go bankrupt. Let him go bankrupt.’ Come on. What’s the matter with these guys."
TRUMP," The bill that was passed in the House was a bailout of badly run high crime, Democrat, all run by Democrats, cities and states. It was a way of getting a lot of money, billions and billions of dollars to these cities. It was also a way of getting a lot of money from our people’s pockets to people that come into our country illegally. We were going to take care of everything for them. And what that does, and I’d love to do that, I’d love to help them. But what that does, everybody all over the world will start pouring into our country. We can’t do it. This was a way of taking care of them. This was a way of spending on things that had nothing to do with COVID, as for your question, but it was really a big bailout for badly run Democrat cities and states."
WELKER, I want —
BIDEN," If I get elected, I’m not gonna — I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I’m gonna be an American president. I don’t see red states and blue states. What I see is American, United States. And folks, every single state out there finds themself in trouble. They’re going to start laying off, whether they’re red or blue. Cops, firefighters, first responders, teachers — because they have to balance their budget. And the founders were smart. They allowed the federal government to deficit spend to compensate for the United States of America."
WELKER," I want to talk about the minimum wage, gentlemen. Mr. Vice President, we are talking a lot about struggling small businesses and business owners these days. Do you think this is the right time to ask them to raise the minimum wage? You, of course, support a $15 minimum wage."
BIDEN," I do, because I think one of the things we’re gonna have to do is we’re gonna have to bail them out, too. We should be bailing them out now, those small businesses. You’ve got one in six of them going under. They’re not going to be able to make it back. They passed a package that allows us to be able to call PPP, money’s supposed to go to help them do everything from organize how they could deal with their businesses being open safely. Schools, how they can make classrooms smaller, how they can hire more teachers, how they can put ventilation systems in. They need the help, the businesses, as well as the schools, need the help. But this, these guys will not help them. He is not giving them any of the money."
WELKER, We are going to move on to immigration —
TRUMP," One thing very quickly. He said we have to help our small businesses — by raising the minimum wage? That’s not helping. I think it should be a state option. Alabama is different than New York, New York is different from Vermont. Every state is different. It should be a state option. We have to help, it’s very important. We have to help our small businesses —"
WELKER, You said —
TRUMP, How are you helping your small businesses when you’re forcing wages. What’s going to happen and what’s been proven to happen is when you do that these small businesses fire many of their employees.
WELKER, You said very recently you would consider raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour —
TRUMP, Say it?
WELKER, You said recently you would consider raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. Is that still the case?
TRUMP," What I’d really like, and I would consider it to an extent. What I’d really like — in a second administration — but not to a level that’s going to put all these businesses out of business. It should be a state option. Look, I’ve looked at different places, I know different places. They’re all different. Some places, $15 is not so bad. In other places, other states, $15 would be —"
WELKER," OK, President Trump, thank you. Quick response, Vice President Biden."
BIDEN," No one should work two jobs, one job and be below poverty. People are making 6, 7, 8 bucks an hour. These first responders we all clap for as they come down the street, because they’ve allowed us to make it. What’s happening? They deserve a minimum wage of $15. Anything below that puts you below the poverty level. And there is no evidence that when you raise the minimum wage, businesses go out of business. That is simply not true."
WELKER," We’re going to talk about immigration. We’re going to talk about immigration, now, gentlemen, and we’re going to talk about families within this context. Mr. President, your administration separated children from their parents at the border, at least 4000 kids. You’ve since reversed your zero tolerance policy, but the United States can’t locate the parents of more than 500 children. So how will these families ever be reunited?"
TRUMP," Children are brought here by coyotes and lots of bad people, cartels, and they’re brought here and they used to use them to get into our country. We now have a stronger border as we’ve ever had. We’re over 400 miles of brand new wall, you see the numbers, and we let people in, but they have to come in legally and they come in through – "
WELKER, But how will you reunite these kids with their families?
TRUMP," Let me just tell you. They built cages. You know, they used to say I built the cages. And then they had a picture in a certain newspaper. There was a picture of these horrible cages and they said, ‘Look at these cages, President Trump built them.’ And then it was determined they were built in 2014. That was him."
WELKER, Do you have a plan to reunite the kids?
TRUMP," Yes, we’re working on it very — we’re trying very hard. But a lot of these kids come out without the parents, they come over through cartels and through coyotes and through gangs."
WELKER," Vice President Biden, let me bring you into this conversation. Quick response and then another question to you."
BIDEN," These 500 plus kids came with parents. They separated them at the border to make it a disincentive to come to begin with. Big, real tough, we’re really strong. And guess what? They cannot — it’s not, coyotes didn’t bring them over, their parents were with them. They got separated from their parents. And it makes us a laughingstock and violates every notion of who we are as a nation."
WELKER, Let me ask you a follow up —
TRUMP," Kristen, they did it, we changed the policy. They did it. We changed it. They set the cages. Who built the cages?"
BIDEN, So let’s talk about —
TRUMP," Who built the cages, Joe?"
BIDEN," Let’s talk about what we’re talking about. What happened? Parents were ripped — their kids were ripped from their arms and separated. And now they cannot find over 500 sets of those parents and those kids are alone. Nowhere to go, nowhere to go. It’s criminal. It’s criminal."
WELKER, Let me ask you —
TRUMP," Kristen, I will say this. They went down, we brought reporters and everything. They are so well taken care of. They’re in facilities that were so clean —"
WELKER, But some of them haven’t been reunited —
TRUMP," But just ask one question. Who built the cages? I’d love you to ask that, who built the cages?"
WELKER," Let me ask about your immigration policy, Mr. Vice President. The Obama administration did fail to deliver immigration reform, which had been a key promise during the administration. It also presided over record deportations as well as family detentions at the border before changing course. So why should voters trust you with an immigration overhaul now?"
BIDEN," Because we made a mistake. It took too long to get it right. Took too long to get it right. I’ll be President of the United States, not Vice President of the United States. And the fact is, I’ve made it very clear, within 100 days, I’m going to send to the United States Congress a pathway to citizenship for over 11 million undocumented people. And all those so called Dreamers, those DACA kids, they’re going to be immediately certified again, to be able to stay in this country, and put on a path to citizenship. The idea that they are being sent home by this guy, and they want to do that, is they go to a country they’ve never seen before. I can imagine you’re five years old, your parents are taking you across the Rio Grande River and it’s and it’s illegal. You say ‘Oh, no, Mom, leave me here. I’m not gonna go with you.’ They’ve been here. Many of them are model citizens. Over 20,000 of them are first responders out there taking care of people during this crisis. We owe them. We owe them."
WELKER," President Trump, your response."
TRUMP," Kristen, he had eight years to do what he said he was going to do. And I’ve changed without having a specific — we got rid of catch and release, we got rid of a lot of horrible things that they put in and that they lived with. But he had eight years he was vice president. He did nothing except build cages to keep children in."
WELKER," Vice President Biden, your response?"
BIDEN," Wrong. The catch and release, you know what he’s talking about there? If in fact, you had a family, came across, they’re arrested. They, in fact, were given a date to show up for their hearing. They were released. And guess what, they showed up for a hearing. This is the first President in the history of the United States of America that anybody seeking asylum has to do it in another country. That’s never happened before in America. That’s never happened before in America. You come to the United States and you make your case. That I seek asylum based on the following premise, why I deserve it under American law. They’re sitting in squalor on the other side of the river."
WELKER," President Trump, there is —"
TRUMP," It’s so important. It just shows that he has no understanding of immigration or the laws. Catch and release is a disaster. A murderer would come in, a rapist would come in, a very bad person would come in — we would take their name, we have to release them into our country. And then you say they come back. Less than 1% of the people come back."
BIDEN, Not true.
TRUMP," We have to send ICE out and Border Patrol out to find them. We would say, ‘Come back in two years, three years — we’re going to give you a court case. You did Perry Mason, we’re going to give you a court case. When you say they come back, they don’t come back, Joe. They never come back. Only the really — I hate to say this — but those with the lowest IQ, they might come back. But there are very very few. "
WELKER," OK, President Trump, let’s give Vice President Biden a chance to respond, and then we’re going to move on to the next section."
TRUMP," You don’t know the law, Joe."
WELKER," Vice President Biden, your response."
BIDEN, I know the law. What he’s telling you is simply not true.
TRUMP, They don’t come back.
BIDEN, Check it out.
WELKER," Alright, let’s move on —"
TRUMP, But we don’t have to worry about it because I terminated it. So we don’t have to worry about it.
WELKER," Alright, let’s move on to the next section —"
BIDEN, You have 525 kids not knowing where in God’s name they’re going to be and lost their parents.
TRUMP, Go ahead.
WELKER," Alright. Let’s talk about our next section, which is race in America. And I want to talk about the way Black and Brown Americans experience race in this country. Part of that experience is something called “the talk.” It happens regardless of class and income — parents who feel they have no choice but to prepare their children for the chance that they could be targeted, including by the police, for no reason other than the color of their skin. Mr. Vice President, in the next two minutes, I want you to speak directly to these families. Do you understand why these parents fear for their children?"
BIDEN," I do. I do. You know, my daughter is a social worker. And she’s written a lot about this. She has a graduate degree from the University of Pennsylvania in social work. And you know, one of the reasons why I ended up working on the East side of Wilmington, Delaware, which is 90 percent African American, was to learn more about what was going on. What I didn’t — I never had to tell my daughter if she’s pulled over, make sure she puts, for a traffic stop, put both hands on top of the wheel. And don’t reach for the glove box because someone may shoot you. But a Black parent, no matter how wealthy or how poor they are, has to teach their child, when you’re walking down the street, don’t have a hoodie on when you go across the street, making sure that you, in fact, if you get pulled over, yes sir, no sir, hands on top of the wheel. Because you are in fact, a victim, whether you’re a person making 300,000 — $300,000-a-year person, or someone who’s on food stamps. The fact of the matter is there is institutional racism in America. And we have always said — we’ve never lived up to it. That we hold these truths to be self-evident, all men and women are created equal. But guess what — we have never ever lived up to it. But we have constantly been moving the needle further and further to inclusion, not exclusion. This is the first president come along and says that’s the end of that. We’re not going to do that anymore. We have to provide for economic opportunity, better education, better health care, better access to schooling, better access to opportunity to borrow money to start businesses. All the things we can do. And I’ve laid out a clear plan as to how to do those things. Just to give people a shot. It’s about accumulating the ability to have wealth, as well as it is to be free from violence."
WELKER," President Trump, same question to you. And let me remind you of the question, I would like you to speak directly to these families. Do you understand why these parents fear for their children?"
TRUMP," Yes, I do. And again, he’s been in government 47 years. He never did a thing except in 1994, when he did such harm to the Black community. And they were called, and he called them, super predators. And he said that, he said it — super predators. And they have never lived that down. 1994, your crime bill, the super predators. Nobody has done more for the Black community than Donald Trump. And if you look, with the exception of Abraham Lincoln–possible exception, but the exception of Abraham Lincoln, nobody has done what I’ve done. Criminal justice reform, Obama and Joe didn’t do it. I don’t even think they tried because they had no chance at doing it. They might have wanted to do it. But if you had to see the arms I had a twist to get that done, it was not a pretty picture. And everybody knows it including some very liberal people that cried in my office–they cried in the Oval Office. Two weeks later, they’re out saying, ‘Gee, we have to defeat him.’ Criminal justice reform, prison reform, opportunity zones with Tim Scott, a great senator from South Carolina. He came in with this incredible idea for opportunity zones. It’s one of the most successful programs. People don’t talk about it. Tremendous investment is being made. Biggest beneficiary, the Black and Hispanic communities and then historically Black colleges and universities. After three years of coming to the office, I love some of those guys, they were great, they came into the office. And they said– I said, ‘What are you doing after three years?’ I said, ‘Why do you keep coming back?’ ‘Because we have no funding’. I said, ‘You don’t have to come back every year’, ‘We have to come back’, because President Obama would never give them long term funding. And I did. Ten-year, long term funding, and I gave them more money than they asked for, because I said, ‘I think you need more’. And I said, ‘The only bad part about this is I may never see you again’, because I got very friendly with them and they like me and I like them. But I saved historically black colleges and universities."
WELKER," OK. And we’re going to talk about both of your records, but your response to that Vice President?"
BIDEN," My response to that is I never, ever said what he accused me of saying. The fact of the matter is, in 2000 though, after the crime bill had been in the law for a while, this is the guy who said, ‘The problem with the crime bill, there’s not enough people in jail. There’s not enough people in jail,’ and go on my website, get the quote, the date when he said it, ‘not enough people’. He talked about marauding gangs, young gangs, the people who are going to maraud our cities. This is a guy who when the Central Park five, five innocent Black kids, he continued to push for making sure that they got the death penalty. None of them were — none of them were guilty of what the crime, of the crimes that were suggested. Look, and talk about he, granted, he did in fact let 20 people — he commuted 20 people’s sentences. We commuted over 1,000 people’s sentences. Over 1,000. The very law he’s talking about is a law that, in fact, initiated by Barack Obama. And secondly, we’re in a situation here where we — the federal prison system was reduced by 38,000 people under our administration. And one of these things we should be doing is there should be no, no minimum mandatories in the law. That’s why I’m offering $20 billion to states to change their state laws to eliminate minimum mandatories and set up drug courts. No one should be going to jail because they have a drug problem. They should be going to rehabilitation, not to jail. We should fundamentally change the system and that’s what I’m going to do."
TRUMP," But why didn’t he do it four years ago? Why didn’t you do that four years ago, even less than that? Why didn’t you–"
BIDEN, I am not–
TRUMP, You were vice president. You keep talking about all these things you’re going to do and you’re going to do this. But you were there just a short time ago and you guys did nothing.
BIDEN, We did–
TRUMP," You know, Joe, I ran because of you. I ran because of Barack Obama, because you did a poor job. If I thought you did a good job, I would have never run. I would’ve never run. I ran because of you. I’m looking at you now, you’re a politician. I ran because of you."
WELKER," Alright, Vice President Biden, your response to that? And then I do have some questions for both of you."
BIDEN," Well, I’ll tell you what, I hope he does look at me because what’s happening here is you know who I am, you know who he is, you know his character, you know my character, you know our reputations for honor and telling the truth. I am anxious to have this race. I’m anxious to see this take place. I am — the character of the country is on the ballot. Our character is on the ballot. Look at us closely."
WELKER, Let me ask them some follow–
TRUMP, Excuse me–
WELKER, Please respond and then we’re gonna have follow up questions.
TRUMP," If this stuff is true about Russia, Ukraine, China, other countries, Iraq — If this is true, then he’s a corrupt politician. So don’t give me the stuff about how you’re this innocent baby. Joe, they’re calling you a corrupt politician–"
BIDEN, Nobody says–
WELKER," President Trump, I want to stay on the issue of race. We’re talking about the issue–"
TRUMP, It’s the laptop from hell. 
WELKER," President Trump, we’re talking about race right now and I do want to stay on the issue of race. President Trump—"
BIDEN," Nobody– Kristen, I have to respond to that."
WELKER," Please, very quickly."
BIDEN," Look, there are 50 former national intelligence folks who said that what this, he’s accusing me of is a Russian plan. They have said that this has all the characteristics — four– five former heads of the CIA, both parties, say what he’s saying is a bunch of garbage. Nobody believes it except him and his good friend Rudy Giuliani."
TRUMP," You mean, the laptop is now another Russia, Russia, Russia hoax? You gotta be–"
BIDEN, That’s exactly what — That’s exactly what–
TRUMP," Is this where you’re going? This is where he’s going. The laptop is Russia, Russia, Russia?"
WELKER," Gentleman, I want to stay on the issue of race, okay —"
TRUMP, You have to be kidding. Here we go again with Russia. Boy oh boy.
WELKER," We’re going to continue on the issue of race. Mr. President, you’ve described the Black Lives Matter movement as a symbol of hate. You’ve shared a video of a man chanting white power to millions of your supporters. You’ve said that Black professional athletes exercising their first amendment rights should be fired. What do you say to Americans who say that kind of language from a president is contributing to a climate of hate and racial strife?"
TRUMP," Well you have to understand the first time I ever heard of Black Lives Matter they were chanting ‘pigs in a blanket’, talking about police, ‘pigs, pigs’, talking about our police, ‘pigs in a blanket, fry’ em like bacon’. I said, ‘That’s a horrible thing’. And they were marching down the street. And that was my first glimpse of Black Lives Matter. I thought it was a terrible thing. As far as my relationships with all people, I think I have great relationships with all people. I am the least racist person in this room."
WELKER, What do you say to Americans who are concerned by that rhetoric?
TRUMP," I don’t, I don’t know what to say. I got criminal justice reform done, and prison reform, and opportunity zones. I took care of Black colleges and universities. I don’t know what to say. They can say anything. I mean, they can say anything. It’s a very — it makes me sad because I am the least racist person. I can’t even see the audience because it’s so dark, but I don’t care who’s in the audience. I’m the least racist person in this room."
WELKER," OK. Vice President Biden, let me ask you – very quickly, and then I have a follow up question for you."
BIDEN," Abraham Lincoln here is one of the most racist presidents we’ve had in modern history. He pours fuel on every single racist fire, every single one. He started off his campaign coming down the escalator saying he’s gonna get rid of those Mexican rapists. He’s banned Muslims because they’re Muslims. He has moved around and made everything worse across the board. He says to them about the ‘Poor Boys’, last time we were on stage here. He said, ‘I told him to stand down and stand ready’. Come on. This guy has a dog whistle about as big as a fog horn."
WELKER," President Trump, I’m going to give you 10 seconds to respond and then I have a follow up question."
TRUMP, He made a reference to Abraham Lincoln. Where did that come in? I mean —
BIDEN, You said you were Abraham Lincoln.
TRUMP," No, no. Where did that – no no, I said not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done what I’ve done for the Black community. I didn’t say ‘I’m Abraham Lincoln’. I said, ‘Not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done but what I’ve done for the Black community’. Now you have done nothing other than the crime bill, which put–"
BIDEN," Oh, God."
TRUMP," Tens of thousands of Black men, mostly, in jail. And you know what? They remember it because if you look at what’s happening with the voting right now, they remember that you treated them very, very badly. Just take a look at what’s happening out there."
WELKER," Vice President Biden, let me give you a chance to respond within this context. Crime bills that you supported in the 80s and 90s contributed to the incarceration of tens of thousands of young Black men who had small amounts of drugs in their possession. They are sons, they are brothers, they are fathers, they’re uncles whose families are still to this day, some of them, suffering the consequences. So speak to those families, why should they vote for you?"
BIDEN," One of the things is that in the ’80s, we passed 100%, all 100 senators voted for it, a bill on drugs and how to deal with drugs. It was a mistake. I’ve been trying to change it since then, particularly the portion on cocaine. That’s why I’ve been arguing that, in fact, we should not send anyone to jail for a pure drug offense. They should be going into treatment across the board. That’s what we should be spending money on. That’s why I set up drug courts which were never funded by Republican friends. They should not be going to jail for a drug or an alcohol problem. They should be going into treatment. Treatment. That’s what we’ve been trying to do. That’s what I’m going to get done because the American people have now seen that in fact, it was a mistake to pass those laws related to drugs. But they were not in the crime bill."
TRUMP," But why didn’t he get it done? See, it’s all talk, no action with these politicians. Why didn’t he get it done? ‘That’s what I’m gonna do when I become president’. You were vice president, along with Obama as your President, your leader, for eight years. Why didn’t you get it done? You had eight years to get it done? Now, you’re saying you’re gonna get it done because you’re all talk and no action, Joe."
BIDEN," We got a lot of it done. We released 38,000 — We got 38,000 prisoners left from —"
TRUMP, You didn’t get anything done. You got nothing done. 
BIDEN," 38,000 prisoners were released from federal prison. We have — there were over 1000 people who were given clemency. We — in fact, we’re the ones that put in the legislation saying we could look at pattern or practice of police departments and what they were doing, how they were conducting themselves. I could go on, but we began the process. We began the process. We lost an election. That’s why I’m running to win back that election and change his terrible policy."
TRUMP," I just ask — I just ask one question: why didn’t you do it in the eight years, a short time ago? Why didn’t you do it? You just said, ‘I’m going to do that. I’m going to do this.’ You put tens of thousands of mostly Black young men in prison. Now you’re saying you’re going to get — you’re going to undo that. Why didn’t you get it done? You had eight years with Obama? You know why, Joe, because you’re all talk and no action."
WELKER," Alright, Vice President Biden and then we’re gonna move on to the next section."
BIDEN, We had a Republican Congress. That’s the answer.
WELKER, OK.
TRUMP," Well, you gotta talk — you gotta talk ’em into it, Joe. Sometimes you gotta talk ’em into it."
WELKER," Alright, we’re gonna move on to our next section which is climate change-"
TRUMP, Like I did with criminal justice reform. I had to talk Democrats into it.
WELKER," Gentlemen, we’re running out of time so we gotta get on to climate change, please. You both have very different visions on climate change. President Trump, you say that environmental regulations have hurt jobs in the energy sector. Vice President Biden, you have said you see addressing climate change as an opportunity to create new jobs. For each of you, how would you both combat climate change and support job growth at the same time? Starting with you, President Trump, you have two minutes uninterrupted."
TRUMP," So we have the trillion trees program, we have so many different programs. I do love the environment, but what I want is the cleanest, crystal clear water, the cleanest air. We have the best, lowest number in carbon emissions, which is a big standard that I noticed Obama goes with all the time. Not Joe. I haven’t heard Joe use the term because I’m not sure he knows what it represents or means, but I have heard Obama use it. And we have the best carbon emission numbers that we’ve had in 35 years. Under this administration, we are working so well with industry, but here’s what we can’t do — Look at China, how filthy it is. Look at Russia. Look at India. It’s filthy. The air is filthy. The Paris Accord, I took us out because we were going to have to spend trillions of dollars and we were treated very unfairly. When they put us in there, they did us a great disservice. They were going to take away our businesses. I will not sacrifice tens of millions of jobs, thousands and thousands of companies because of the Paris Accord. It was so unfair. China doesn’t kick in until 2030. Russia goes back to a low standard and we kicked in right away. It would have been — It would have been– It would have destroyed our businesses. So, you ready? We have done an incredible job environmentally. We have the cleanest air, the cleanest water and the best carbon emission standards that we’ve seen in many, many years."
WELKER, Vice President Biden —
TRUMP, And we haven’t destroyed our industries.
WELKER," Vice President Biden, two minutes to you uninterrupted."
BIDEN," Climate change, climate warming, global warming is an existential threat to humanity. We have a moral obligation to deal with it. And we’re told by all the leading scientists in the world we don’t have much time. We’re going to pass the point of no return within the next eight to 10 years. Four more years of this man eliminating all the regulations that were put in by us to clean up the climate, to clean up — to limit the — limit of emissions, will put us in a position where we’re going to be in real trouble. Here’s where we have a great opportunity. I was able to get both all the environmental organizations as well as labor, the people worried about jobs, to support my climate plan. Because what it does, it will create millions of new, good-paying jobs. We’re going to invest in, for example, 500,000 — 50,000, excuse me, 50,000 charging stations on our highways so that we can own the electric car market in the future. In the meantime, China’s doing that. We’re going to be in a position where we’re going to see to it that we’re going to take 4 million existing billion, buildings and 2 million existing homes and retrofit them so they don’t leak as much energy, saving hundreds of millions of barrels of oil in the process and creating significant number of jobs. And by the way, the whole idea of what this is all going to do, it’s going to create millions of jobs and it’s going to clean the environment. Our health and our jobs are at stake. That’s what’s happening. And what — right now, by the way, Wall Street firm has indicated that my plan — my plan will, in fact, create 18.6 million jobs, 7 million more than his. This from Wall Street and I’ll create $1 trillion more in economic growth than his proposal does, not on climate just on the economy."
WELKER," President Trump, your response —"
TRUMP," They came out and said very strongly, ‘$6,500 will be taken away from families under his plan’, that his plan is an economic disaster. If you look at what he wants to do, you know the, if you look at his plan, his environmental plan, you know who developed it? AOC+3. They know nothing about the climate. I mean, she’s got a good line of stuff, but she knows nothing about the climate. And they’re all hopping through hoops for AOC+3. Look, their real plan costs $100 trillion. If we had the best year in the history of our country for 100 years, we would not even come close to a number like that. When he says buildings, they want to take buildings down because they want to make bigger windows into smaller windows. As far as they’re concerned, if you had no window it would be a lovely thing. This is the craziest plan that anybody has ever seen. And this wasn’t done by smart people. This wasn’t done by anybody. Frankly, I don’t even know how it can be good politically. They want to spend $100 trillion. That’s their real number. He’s trying to say it was six. It’s $100 trillion. They want to knock down buildings and build new buildings with little tiny, small windows and many other things. And many other things–"
WELKER," Alright — okay, let me have the vice president respond and we’re running out of time and we have a lot more questions to get to. So let’s hear from the Vice President. I have a number of more questions."
BIDEN," I don’t know where he comes from. I don’t know where he comes up with these numbers. $100 trillion? Give me a break. This plan was — This plan has been endorsed by every major — every major environmental group and every labor group. Labor. Because they know the future lies, the future lies in us being able to breathe. And they know they’re good jobs in getting us there. And by the way, the fastest growing industry in America are –is, is, is the electric — excuse me, solar energy and wind. He thinks wind causes cancer, windmills. It’s the fastest growing jobs and they pay good prevailing wages, 45, 50 bucks an hour. We can grow and we can be cleaner, if we go the route I’m proposing."
WELKER, President Trump — please respond and then I have some follow ups.
TRUMP," Excuse me. We are energy independent for the first time. We don’t need all of these countries that we had a fight, war over because we needed their energy. We are energy independent. I know more about wind than you do. It’s extremely expensive, kills all the birds, it’s very intermittent. It’s got a lot of problems and they happen to make the windmills in both Germany and China. And the fumes coming up — if you’re a believer in carbon emission, the fumes coming up to make — make these massive windmills is more than anything that we’re talking about with natural gas, which is very clean. One other thing —"
BIDEN, Find me a scientist that says that.
TRUMP," Solar. I love solar, but solar doesn’t quite have it yet. It’s not powerful enough yet to — to really run our big beautiful factories that we need to compete with the world —"
BIDEN, False.
TRUMP," So, it’s all a pipe dream, but you know what we’ll do? We’re gonna have the greatest economy in the world. But if you want to kill the economy, get rid of your oil industry. You want – and what about fracking?"
WELKER, Alright. Let me allow Vice President Biden to respond —
BIDEN, I have never said I oppose fracking.
TRUMP, You said it on tape.
BIDEN, I did? Show the tape. Put it on your website.
TRUMP, I’ll put it on.
BIDEN, Put it on the website. The fact of the matter is he’s flat lying.
WELKER, Would you rule out banning fracking?
BIDEN," I do rule out banning fracking because the answer we need — we need other industries to transition to get to, ultimately, a complete zero emissions by 2025. What I will do with fracking over time is make sure that we can capture the emissions from the fracking. Capture the emissions from gas. We can do that and we can do that by investing money into — it’s a transition to that."
WELKER, I have one more question —
TRUMP," Excuse me. He was against fracking. He said it. I will show that to you tomorrow. ‘I am against fracking’, until he got the nomination, went to Pennsylvania, then he said — you know what, Pennsylvania? He’ll be against it very soon because his party is totally against it."
BIDEN," Fracking on federal land, I said, no fracking and oil on federal land —"
WELKER," Let me ask this final question in this section and then I want to move on to our final section. President Trump, people of color are much more likely to live near oil refineries and chemical plants. In Texas there are families who worry the plants near them are making them sick. Your administration has rolled back regulations on these kinds of facilities. Why should these families give you another four years in office?"
TRUMP," The families that we’re talking about are employed heavily and they are making a lot of money, more money than they’ve ever made. If you look at the kind of numbers that we produce for Hispanic, or Black, or Asian, it’s nine times greater, the percentage gain than it was under — in three years — than it was under eight years of the two of them, to put it nicely. Nine times more. Now, somebody lives — I have not heard the numbers or the statistics that you’re saying — but they’re making a tremendous amount of money. Economically, we saved it. And I saved it again a number of months ago when oil was crashing because of the pandemic. We saved it. We got — say what you want of that relationship, we got Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Russia to cut back, way back. We saved our oil industry and now it’s very vibrant and everybody has very inexpensive gasoline. Remember that."
WELKER," Vice President Biden, your response and then we’re going to have a final question for both of you."
BIDEN," My response is that those people live on what they call ‘fence lines’. He doesn’t understand this. They live near chemical plants that, in fact, pollute. Chemical plants and oil plants and refineries that pollute. I used to live near that when I was growing up in Claymont, Delaware. And all the more oil refineries in Marcus Hook and the Delaware River than there is any place, including in Houston at the time. When my mom would get in the car when there were first frost to drive me to school, turned on the windshield wipers there’d be oil slick in the window. That’s why so many people in my state were dying and getting cancer. The fact is those frontline communities, it doesn’t matter what you’re paying them. It matters how you keep them safe. What do you do? And you impose restrictions on the pollutions, on the pollutants coming out of those fence line communities."
WELKER," OK, I have one final question —"
TRUMP, Would he close down the oil industry — would you close down the oil industry?
BIDEN," I would transition from the oil industry, yes."
TRUMP," Oh, transition. That’s a big statement."
BIDEN, It is a big statement because I would stop —
WELKER, Why would you do that?
BIDEN," Because the oil industry pollutes, significantly — but here’s the deal —"
TRUMP, I see. That’s a big statement.
BIDEN," Well, if you let me finish the statement, because it has to be replaced by renewable energy over time. Over time. And I’d stop giving to the oil industry — I’d stop giving them federal subsidies. You won’t give federal subsidies to the gas and, excuse me, to solar and wind. Why are we giving it to oil industry?"
TRUMP, We actually do give it to solar and wind–
WELKER," Alright, we have one final question —"
TRUMP," And that’s maybe the biggest statement in terms of business, that’s the biggest statement."
WELKER," Okay, we have one final question. Mr. President —"
TRUMP, Because basically what he’s saying is he is going to destroy the oil industry. Will you remember that Texas? Will you remember that Pennsylvania? Oklahoma? Ohio?
WELKER," Vice President Biden, let me give you ten seconds to respond and then I have to get to the final question. Vice President Biden?"
BIDEN," He takes everything out of context, but the point is, look, we have to move toward a net zero emissions. The first place to do that by the year 2035 is in energy production. By 2050, totally."
WELKER, Alright. One final question —
TRUMP, Is he gonna get China to do it? Is he going to get China to do it?
WELKER," No, we’re finished with this. We have to move on to our final question."
BIDEN," No, I’m going to rejoin the Paris Accord and make China abide by what they agreed to."
TRUMP, That’ll cost you $1 trillion.
WELKER," This is about leadership, gentlemen, and this first question does go to you, President Trump. Imagine this is your Inauguration Day. What will you say in your address to Americans who did not vote for you? You’ll each have one minute, starting with you, Mr. President."
TRUMP," We have to make our country totally successful, as it was prior to the plague coming in from China. Now we’re rebuilding it and we’re doing record numbers, 11.4 million jobs in a short period of time etc. But, I will tell you, go back before the plague came in, just before, I was getting calls from people that were not normally people that would call me. They wanted to get together. We had the best Black unemployment numbers in the history of our country, Hispanic, women, Asian, people with diplomas, with no diplomas, MIT graduates, number one in the class — everybody had the best numbers. And you know what? The other side wanted to get together. They wanted to unify. Success is going to bring us together. We are on the road to success. But I’m cutting taxes and he wants to raise everybody’s taxes. And he wants to put new regulations on everything. He will kill it. If he gets in, you will have a depression, the likes of which you’ve never seen. Your 401K’s will go to hell and it’ll be a very, very sad day for this country."
WELKER," Alright. Vice President Biden, same question to you. What will you say during your inaugural address to Americans who did not vote for you?"
BIDEN," I will say, I’m an American president. I represent all of you whether you voted for me or against me. And I’m going to make sure that you’re represented. I’m going to give you hope. We’re going to move. We’re going to choose science over fiction. We’re going to choose hope over fear. We’re going to choose to move forward because we have enormous opportunities, enormous opportunities to make things better. We can grow this economy. We can deal with systemic racism. At the same time, we can make sure that our economy is being run, and moved, and motivated by clean energy, creating millions of new jobs. And that’s the fact, that’s what we’re going to do. And I’m going to say, as I said at the beginning, what is on the ballot here is the character of this country. Decency. Honor. Respect. Treating people with dignity. Making sure that everyone has an even chance. Now, I’m going to make sure you get that. You haven’t been getting it the last four years."
PAGE," Good evening. From the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, welcome to the first, and only, vice presidential debate of 2020, sponsored by the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates. I’m Susan Page of USA TODAY. It is my honor to moderate this debate, an important part of our democracy. In Kingsbury Hall tonight we have a small and socially distant audience and we’ve taken extra precautions during this pandemic. Among other things, everyone in the audience is required to wear a face mask and the candidates will be seated 12 feet apart. The audience is enthusiastic about their candidates, but they’ve agreed to express that enthusiasm, only twice. At the end of the debate and now when I introduce the candidates. Please welcome California Senator Kamala Harris and Vice President Mike Pence."
PENCE, Thank you.
PAGE," Senator Harris and Vice President Pence thank you for being here. We’re meeting as President Trump and the First Lady continue to undergo treatment in Washington after testing positive for COVID-19. We send our thoughts and prayers to them for their rapid and complete recovery and for the recovery of everyone afflicted by the coronavirus. The two campaigns and the Commission on Presidential Debates have agreed to the ground rules for tonight. I’m here to enforce them on behalf of the millions of Americans who are watching. One note, no one in either campaign, or at the commission or anywhere else has been told in advance what topics I’ll raise or what questions I’ll ask. This ninety-minute debate will be divided into nine segments of about 10 minutes each. I’ll begin a segment by posing a question to each of you, sometimes the same question, sometimes a different question on the same topic. You will then have two minutes to answer, without interruption by me or the other candidate. Then we’ll take six minutes or so to discuss the issue. At that point, although there will always be more to say, we’ll move on to the next topic. We want a debate that is lively, but Americans also deserve a discussion that is civil. These are tumultuous times, but we can and will have a respectful exchange about the big issues facing our nation. Let’s begin with the ongoing pandemic that has cost our country so much. Senator Harris, the coronavirus is not under control. Over the past week, Johns Hopkins reports that 39 states have had more COVID cases over the past seven days than in the week before. Nine states have set new records. Even if a vaccine is released soon, the next administration will face hard choices. What would a Biden administration do in January and February that a Trump administration wouldn’t do? Would you impose new lockdowns for businesses and schools in hotspots? A federal mandate to wear masks? You have two minutes to respond, without interruption."
HARRIS," Thank you Susan. Well, the American people have witnessed what is the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country. And here are the facts. 210,000 dead people in our country in just the last several months. Over 7 million people who have contracted this disease. One in five businesses closed. We’re looking at frontline workers who have been treated like sacrificial workers. We are looking at over 30 million people who in the last several months had to file for unemployment. And here’s the thing, on January 28, the vice president and the president were informed about the nature of this pandemic. They were informed that it’s lethal in consequence, that it is airborne, that it will affect young people and that it would be contracted because it is airborne. And they knew what was happening, and they didn’t tell you. Can you imagine if you knew on January 28, as opposed to March 13, what they knew what you might have done to prepare? They knew and they covered it up. The president said it was a hoax. They minimized the seriousness of it. The president said you’re on one side of his ledger if you wear a mask, you’re on the other side of his ledger if you don’t. And in spite of all of that, today they still don’t have a plan. They still don’t have a plan. Well, Joe Biden does. And our plan is about what we need to do around a national strategy for contact tracing, for testing, for administration of the vaccine and making sure that it will be free for all. That is the plan that Joe Biden has and that I have, knowing that we have to get a hold of what has been going on and we need to save our country. And Joe Biden is the best leader to do that and frankly, this administration has forfeited their right to reelection, based on this."
PAGE," Thank you- Thank you, Senator Harris. Thank you, Senator Harris. Vice President Pence, more than 210,000 Americans have died of COVID-19 since February. The US death toll as a percentage of our population is higher than that of almost every other wealthy nation on Earth. For instance, our death rate is two and a half times that of Canada, next door. You head the administration’s Coronavirus Task Force. Why is the U.S. death toll, as a percentage of our population, higher than that of almost every other wealthy country? And you have two minutes to respond, without interruption."
PENCE," Susan thank you. And I want to thank the Commission and the University of Utah for hosting this event. And Senator Harris, it’s a privilege to be on the stage with you. Our nation has gone through a very challenging time this year. But I want the American people to know that from the very first day, President Donald Trump has put the health of America first. Before there were more than five cases in the United States, all people who had returned from China, President Donald Trump did what no other American president had ever done. And that was he suspended all travel from China, the second largest economy in the world. Now, Senator, Joe Biden opposed that decision. He said it was xenophobic and hysterical, but I can tell you, having led the White House Coronavirus Task Force, that that decision alone by President Trump bought us invaluable time to stand up the greatest national mobilization since World War II. And I believe it’s saved hundreds of thousands of American lives. Because with that time we were able to reinvent testing. More than 115 million tests have been done to date. We were able to see to the delivery of billions of supplies so our doctors and nurses had the resources and support they needed. And we began, really before the month of February it was hard to develop a vaccine and to develop medicines and therapeutics that’ve been saving lives all along the way. And under President Trump’s leadership, Operation Warp Speed, we believe, will have literally tens of millions of doses of a vaccine before the end of this year. The reality is, when you look at the Biden plan, it reads an awful lot like what President Trump and I and our task force have been doing every step of the way. And quite frankly, when I look at their plan that talks about advancing testing, creating new PPE, developing a vaccine, umm, it looks a little bit like plagiarism, which is something Joe Biden knows a little bit about. I think the American people know that this is a president who has put the health of America first and the American people, I believe with my heart, can be proud of the sacrifices they have made. It’s saved countless American lives."
PAGE," Thank you, Vice Pres- Thank you Vice President Pence- Thank you, Vice President Pence. Senator Harris, would you like to respond?"
HARRIS," Oh, absolutely. Whatever the Vice President’s claiming the administration has done, clearly it hasn’t worked when you’re looking at over 210,000 dead bodies in our country, American lives that have been lost, families that are grieving that loss. And you know, the vice president is the head of the task force and knew, on January 28, how serious this was. And then, big thanks to Bob Woodward, we learned that they knew about it. And then when that was exposed, the vice president said when asked ‘Well, why didn’t y’all tell anybody?’, he said ‘Because the president wanted people to remain calm’."
PAGE," Well, let’s go –"
HARRIS," No, I – Susan, I – This is important –"
PENCE," Susan, I have to weigh in here –"
HARRIS," Mr. Vice President, I’m speaking."
PENCE, I have to weigh in –
HARRIS, I’m speaking. I wanna –
PAGE, You have 15 more seconds and then we’ll give the vice president a chance to respond.
HARRIS," Thank you. So I want to ask the American people, how calm were you when you were panicked about where you’re going to get your next roll of toilet paper? How calm were you when your kids were sent home from school and you didn’t know when they could go back?"
PAGE," Thank you. Thank you, Senator Harris –"
HARRIS, How calm were you when your children couldn’t see your parents because you were afraid they could kill them?
PAGE," Let’s give Vice President Pence a chance to respond. Vice President Pence, you have one minute to respond."
PENCE," You know there’s not a day gone by that I haven’t thought of every American family that’s lost a loved one. And I want all of you to know that you’ll always be in our hearts and in our prayers. But when you say what the American people have done over these last eight months hasn’t worked, that’s a great disservice to the sacrifices the American people have made."
HARRIS, I’m referring to your president.
PENCE," The reality – If I may, if I may finish, Senator. The reality is Dr. Fauci said everything that he told the President in the Oval Office, the President told the American people. Now President Trump I will tell you has boundless confidence in the American people and he always spoke with confidence that we’d get through this together. But when you say it hasn’t worked – when Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birks and our medical experts came to us in the second week of March, they said if the President didn’t take the unprecedented step of shutting down roughly half of the American economy that we could lose 2.2 million Americans. That’s the reality."
PAGE," Thank you. Thank you, Vice President Pence –"
PENCE," They also said to us if we did everything right, Susan, we could still lose more than 200,000 Americans."
PAGE, Vice President Pence –
PENCE," Now, one life lost is too many, Susan."
PAGE, Thank you –
PENCE," But the American people, I believe, deserve credit for the sacrifices that they have made, putting the health of their family and their neighbors first, our doctors, our nurses, our first responders –"
PAGE," Thank you, Vice President Pence –"
PENCE, – and I’m going to speak up on behalf of what the American people have done.
PAGE," Vice President Pence, you were in the front row at a Rose Garden event 11 days ago, at what seems to have been a super-spreader event for senior administration and congressional officials. No social distancing, few masks, and now a cluster of coronavirus cases among those who were there. How can you expect Americans to follow the administration safety guidelines to protect themselves from COVID when you at the White House have not been doing so?"
PENCE," Well, the American people have demonstrated over the last eight months that when given the facts they’re willing to put the health of their families, and their neighbors and people they don’t even know first. President Trump and I have great confidence in the American people and their ability to take that information and put it into practice. In the height of the epidemic, when we were losing a heartbreaking number of 2,500 Americans a day, we surged resources to New Jersey, and New York, and New Orleans and Detroit. We told the American people what needed to be done and the American people made the sacrifices. When the outbreak in the Sunbelt happened this summer, again, Americans stepped forward. But the reality is the work of the President of the United States goes on. A vacancy on the Supreme Court of the United States has come upon us and the president introduced Judge Amy Coney Barrett –"
PAGE," Yes, thank you- Thank you, Vice President Pence –"
PENCE," At that- If I may say, that Rose Garden event, there’s been a great deal of speculation about it. My wife Karen and I were there and honored to be there. Many of the people who were at that event, Susan, actually were tested for coronavirus. And it was an outdoor event, which all of our scientists regularly and routinely advise, the difference here is President Trump and I trust the American people to make choices in the best interest of their health. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris consistently talk about mandates, and not not just mandates with the coronavirus but a government takeover of healthcare, the Green New Deal –"
PAGE," Thank you- Thank you, Vice President Pence –"
PENCE, – all government control. We’re about freedom and respecting the freedom of the American people.
HARRIS, Let’s talk about respecting the American people. You respect the American people when you tell them the truth. You respect the American people when you have the courage to be a leader –
PENCE, Which we’ve always done –
HARRIS," – speaking of those things that you may not want people to hear but they need to hear so they can protect themselves. But this administration stood on information that if you had as a parent, if you had as a worker knowing you didn’t have enough money saved up, and now you’re standing in a food line because of the ineptitude of an administration that was unwilling to speak the truth to the American people. So let’s talk about caring about the American people. The American people who have had to sacrifice far too much because of the incompetence of this administration. It is asking too much of the people –"
PENCE," Susan, we talked about the American people –"
PAGE, Vice President Pence –
HARRIS, – It is asking too much of the people that they would not be equipped with the information they need to help themselves to protect their parents and their children.
PENCE," Susan, the president –"
PAGE," No, I’m sorry. Kamala Harris – Senator Harris, I mean. I’m sorry."
HARRIS, It’s fine. I’m Kamala.
PAGE," No, no, you’re Senator Harris to me. For life to get back to normal Dr. Anthony Fauci and other experts say that most of the people who can be vaccinated need to be vaccinated, but half of Americans now say they wouldn’t take a vaccine if it was released now. If the Trump administration approves a vaccine, before or after the election, should Americans take it and would you take it?"
HARRIS," If the public health professionals, if Dr. Fauci, if the doctors tell us that we should take it, I’ll be the first in line to take it. Absolutely. But if Donald Trump tells us that we should take it, I’m not taking it."
PAGE," Vice President Pence, there have been a lot of repercussions from this pandemic. In recent days, the president’s diagnosis of COVID-19 has underscored the importance of the job that you hold, and that you are seeking. That’s our second topic tonight, it’s the role of the vice president. One of you will make history on January 20, you will be the vice president to the oldest president the United States has ever had. Donald Trump will be 74-years-old on Inauguration Day. Joe Biden will be 78-years-old. That already has raised concerns among some voters, concerns that have been sharpened by President Trump’s hospitalization in recent days. Vice President Pence, have you had a conversation or reached an agreement with President Trump about safeguards or procedures when it comes to the issue of presidential disability? And if not, do you think you should? You have two minutes without interruption."
PENCE," Well, Susan, thank you. Although I would like to go back –"
PAGE, I think we need to move on to the issue of the vice presidency –
PENCE," Well, thank you but, I would like to go back. Because the reality is that we’re going to have a vaccine, Senator, in record time, in unheard of time, in less than a year. We have five companies in phase three clinical trials. And we’re right now producing tens of millions of doses. So, the fact that you continue to undermine public confidence in a vaccine if the vaccine emerges during the Trump administration, I think is unconscionable. And Senator, I just ask you, stop playing politics with people’s lives. The reality is that we will have a vaccine, we believe, before the end of this year, and it will have the capacity to save countless American lives. And your continuous undermining of confidence in a vaccine is just, it’s just unacceptable. And let me also say, you know the reality is when you talk about, about failure in this administration, we actually do know what failure looks like in a pandemic. It was 2009. The Swine Flu arrived in the United States. Thankfully, it was, ended up not being as lethal as the coronavirus. But before the end of the year, when Joe Biden was Vice President of the United States, not seven and a half million people contracted the swine flu, 60 million Americans contracted the swine flu. If the swine flu had been as lethal as the coronavirus in 2009 when Joe Biden was vice president, we would have lost 2 million American lives. His own Chief of Staff Ron Klain would say last year that it was pure luck. That they did “everything possible wrong”. And we learned from that. They left the Strategic National Stockpile empty. They left an empty and hollow plan, but we still learned from it. And I think –"
PAGE," Thank you, Vice President Pence – Vice President Pence, your time is up –"
PENCE," – the American people, I’m gonna say again, can be proud of what we have done–"
PAGE," Vice President Pence, I’m sorry. Your time is up– Thank you, Vice President Pence –"
PENCE," – and, Senator, please stop undermining confidence in a vaccine."
PAGE," Senator Harris, let me ask you the same question that I asked Vice President Pence, which is have you had a conversation, or reached an agreement with Vice President Biden, about safeguards or procedures when it comes to the issue of presidential disability? And if not, and if you win the election next month, do you think you should? You have two minutes, uninterrupted."
HARRIS," So let me tell you first of all, on the day I got the call from Joe Biden, it was actually a Zoom call, asking me to serve with him on this ticket was probably one of the most memorable, memorable days of my life. I, you know, I thought about my mother, who came to the United States at the age of 19, gave birth to me at the age of 25 at Kaiser Hospital in Oakland, California. And the thought that I’d be sitting here right now I know would make her proud and she must be looking down on this. You know Joe and I were raised in a very similar way. We were raised with values that are about hard work, about the value and the dignity of public service and about the importance of fighting for the dignity of all people. And I think Joe asked me to serve with him because I have a career that included being elected the first woman District Attorney of San Francisco, where I created models of innovation for law enforcement, in terms of reform of the criminal justice system. I was elected the first woman of color, and black woman, to be elected Attorney General of the state of California, where I ran the second largest Department of Justice in the United States, second only to the United States Department of Justice. There I took on everything from transnational criminal organizations, to the big banks that were taking advantage of homeowners, to for profit colleges that were taking advantage of veterans. And then, of course, now I serve in the United States Senate as only the second black woman ever elected to the United States Senate. I serve on the Senate Intelligence Committee where I’ve been in regular receipt of classified information about threats to our nation and hotspots around the world. I’ve traveled the world. I’ve met with our soldiers in our, in war zones. And I think Joe has asked me to serve with him because he knows that we share, we share a purpose, which is about lifting up the American people. And after the four years that we have seen of Donald Trump, unifying our country around our common values and principles."
PAGE," Thank you, Senator Harris. You know neither, neither President Trump nor Vice President Biden has released the sort of detailed health information that had become the modern norm until the 2016 election. And in recent days, President Trump’s doctors have given misleading answers or refused to answer basic questions about his health. And my question to each of you, in turn, is, is this information voters deserve to know? Vice President Pence, would you like to go first?"
PENCE," Well, Susan, thank you. And let me, let me say on behalf of the President and the First Lady, how moved we’ve all been by the outpouring of prayers and concern for the President. And I do believe it’s emblematic of the prayers and the concern that have ushered forth for every American impacted by the coronavirus. But the care the president received at Walter Reed Hospital, White House doctors, was exceptional. And the transparency that they practiced all along the way will continue because the American people have a right to know about the health and well-being of their President. And we’ll continue to do that. But I’m just extremely grateful and was more than, more than a little moved by the broad and bipartisan support. And, Senator, I want to thank you and Joe Biden for your expressions and genuine concern. And I also want to congratulate you, as I did on that phone call, on the historic nature of your nomination."
HARRIS, Thank you.
PENCE," I never expected to be on this stage four years ago so I know the feeling. But the reality is, we’ve got an election before the American people, in the midst of this challenging year, and the stakes have never been higher."
PAGE," Thank you – Thank you, Vice President Pence. I wanna give Senator Harris a chance to respond to the same question I asked, which is do voters have a right to know more detailed health information about presidential candidates, and especially about presidents, especially when they’re facing some kind of challenge?"
HARRIS," Absolutely. And that’s why Joe Biden has been so incredibly transparent. And certainly, by contrast, the President has not, both in terms of health records, but also let’s look at taxes. We now know because of great investigative journalism that Donald Trump paid $750 in taxes. When I first heard about it, I literally said “You mean $750,000?”. And it was like no, $750. We now know Donald Trump owes and is in debt for $400 million. And just so everyone is clear, when we say in debt it means you owe money to somebody. And it’d be really good to know who the President of the United States, the Commander in Chief, owes money to because the American people have a right to know what is influencing the president’s decisions. And is he making those decisions on the best interest of the American people, of you, or self interest. So, Susan, I’m glad you asked about transparency, because it has to be across the board. Joe has been incredibly transparent over many, many years. The one thing we all know about Joe, he puts it all out there. He, he is honest. He is forthright. But Donald Trump on the other hand, has been about covering up everything."
PENCE, Susan –
PENCE," Thank – Thanks – Thank you, Senator Harris. I want to give you a chance to respond, Vice President."
PENCE," Well, look, I respect the fact that Joe Biden spent 47 years in public life. I respect your public service as well."
HARRIS, Thank you.
PENCE," But the American people have a president who is a businessman, he’s a job-creator. He’s paid tens of millions of dollars in taxes, payroll taxes, property taxes. He’s created tens of thousands of American jobs. The president said those public reports are not accurate. And the President also released, literally, stacks of financial disclosures the American people can review just as the law allows. But the distinction here is that Joe Biden, 47 years in public service, compared to President Donald Trump, who brought all of that experience four years ago–"
PAGE," Thank you – Thank you, Vice President –"
PENCE," – and turned this economy around by cutting taxes, rolling back regulation, unleashing American energy-"
PAGE," Thank you – Thank you, Vice President Pence –"
PENCE," – fighting for free and fair trade, and all of that is on the line –"
PAGE," Thank you, Vice President Pence –"
PENCE, – if Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are in the White House.
PAGE," You know, that’s a good segue into our third topic–"
HARRIS, That’s a great segue.
PAGE," – which is about the economy. This has been another aspect of life for Americans that’s been so affected by this coronavirus. We have a jobs crisis brewing. On Friday, we learned that the unemployment rate had declined to 7.9% in September, but the job growth had stalled, and that was before the latest round of layoffs and furloughs in the airline industry, at Disney and elsewhere. Hundreds of thousands of discouraged workers have stopped looking for work. Nearly 11 million jobs that existed at the beginning of the year, haven’t been replaced. Those hardest hit include Latinos, blacks and women. Senator Harris, the Biden-Harris campaign has proposed new programs to boost the economy and you would pay for that new spending by raising $4 trillion in taxes on wealthy individuals and corporations. Some economists warn that could curb entrepreneurial ventures that fuel growth and create jobs. Would raising taxes put the recovery at risk? And you have two minutes to answer, uninterrupted."
HARRIS," Thank you. On the issue of the economy, I think there couldn’t be a more fundamental difference between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Joe Biden believes you measure the health and the strength of America’s economy based on the health, and the strength of the American worker and the American family. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump, who measures the strength of the economy based on how rich people are doing. Which is why he passed a tax bill benefitting the top 1% and the biggest corporations of America, leading to a $2 trillion deficit that the American people are gonna have to pay for. On day one, Joe Biden will repeal that tax bill. He’ll get rid of it. And what he’ll do with the money is invest it in the American people. And through a plan that is about investing in infrastructure, something that Donald Trump said he would do. I remember hearing about some infrastructure week, I don’t think it ever happened. But Joe Biden will do that. He’ll invest in infrastructure. It’s about upgrading our roads and bridges, but also investing in clean energy and renewable energy. Joe is gonna invest that money in what we need to do around innovation. There was a time when our country believed in science and invested in research and development so that we were an innovation leader on the globe. Joe Biden will use that money to invest in education. So for example, for folks who want to go to a two year Community College, it will be free. If you come from a family that makes less than $125,000, you’ll go to a public university for free. And across the board, we’ll make sure that if you have student loan debt it’s cut by $10,000. That’s how Joe Biden thinks about the economy, which is it’s about investing in the people of our country, as opposed to passing a tax bill, which had the benefit of letting American corporations go offshore to do their business."
PAGE," Thank you, Senator Harris."
HARRIS, You’re welcome.
PAGE," Vice President Pence, your administration has been predicting a rapid and robust recovery, but the latest economic report suggests that’s not happening. Should Americans be braced for an economic comeback that is going to take not months, but a year or more? You have two minutes to answer, uninterrupted."
PENCE," When President Trump and I took office, America had gone through the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression. When Joe Biden was vice president they tried to tax, and spend, and regulate, and bail our way back to a growing economy. President Trump cut taxes, across the board. Despite what Senator Harris says, the average American family of four had $2,000 in savings in taxes. And with the rise in wages that occurred, most predominantly for blue-collar, hardworking Americans, the average household income for a family of four increased by $4,000 following President Trump’s tax cuts. But America, you just heard Senator Harris tell you, on day one Joe Biden’s gonna raise your taxes. It’s really remarkable to think, Susan –"
HARRIS, That’s not what I said.
PENCE," – I mean, right after a time where we’re going through a pandemic that lost 22 million jobs at the height, we’ve already added back 11.6 million jobs because we had a president who cut taxes, rolled back regulation, unleashed American energy, fought for free and fair trade, and secured $4 trillion from the Congress of the United States to give direct payments to families, saved 50 million jobs through the paycheck protection program. We literally have spared no expense to help the American people and the American worker through this. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris want to raise taxes. They want to bury our economy under a $2 trillion Green New Deal, which you were one of the original co-sponsors of in the United States Senate. They want to abolish fossil fuels and ban fracking, which would cost hundreds of thousands of American jobs all across the Heartland. And Joe Biden wants to go back to the economic surrender to China that when we took office, half of our international trade deficit was with China alone. And Joe Biden wants to repeal all of the tariffs that President Trump put into effect to fight for American jobs and American workers. Joe Biden says democracy’s on the ballot. Make no mistake about it, Susan. The American economy, the American comeback is on the ballot with four more years of growth and opportunity –"
PAGE," Thank you – Thank you, Vice President Pence –"
PENCE, – with four more years of President Donald Trump. 2021 is gonna be the biggest economic year in the history of this country.
PAGE," Thank you, Vice President Pence – Thank you, Vice President Pence. Senator Harris?"
HARRIS," Well, I mean, I thought we saw enough of it in last week’s debate, but I think this is supposed to be a debate based on fact and truth. And the truth and the fact is, Joe Biden has been very clear. He will not raise taxes on anybody who makes less than $400,000 a year –"
PENCE, He said he’s going to repeal the Trump tax cuts –
HARRIS, Mr. Vice President I’m speaking.
PENCE, Well –
HARRIS, I’m speaking.
PENCE," – it’d be important if you said the truth. Joe Biden said twice in the debate last week that he’s going to repeal the Trump tax cuts. That was tax cuts that gave the average working family $2,000 in a tax break every single year –"
HARRIS, That is – That is absolutely not true –
PENCE," – Senator, that’s the math –"
HARRIS, – that tax bill –
PENCE, Is he only gonna repeal part of the Trump tax cuts?
HARRIS, If you don’t mind letting me finish –
PENCE, Please
HARRIS, We can then have a conversation. Okay?
PENCE, Please
HARRIS," Okay. Joe Biden will not raise taxes on anyone who makes less than $400,000 a year. He has been very clear about that. Joe Biden will not end fracking. He has been very clear about that. Joe Biden is the one who during the Great Recession was responsible for the Recovery Act that brought America back. And now the Trump Pence Administration wants to take credit when they ran when they rode the coattails of Joe Biden’s success for the economy that they had at the beginning of their term. Of course now the economy is a complete disaster, but Joe Biden on the one hand, did that. On the other hand you have Donald Trump, who has reigned over a recession that is being compared to the Great Depression. On the one hand you have Joe Biden, who was responsible with President Barack Obama for the Affordable Care Act, which brought health care to over 20 million Americans and protected people with pre-existing conditions and what it also did is it saved those families, who otherwise were going bankrupt because of hospital bills they could not afford. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump who is in court right now trying to get rid of –"
PAGE," Thank you, Senator Harris –"
HARRIS," – trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which means that you will lose protections, if you have pre-existing conditions. And I just, this is very important, Susan –"
PAGE," Yes, well we need to give – We need to give Vice President –"
HARRIS," – and it’s just – He interrupted me and I’d like to just finish, please. If you have a pre-existing condition, heart disease, diabetes, breast cancer, they’re coming for you. If you love someone who has a pre-existing condition –"
PENCE, Nonsense
PAGE," Thank you – Thank you, Senator Harris –"
PENCE, That’s nonsense
HARRIS," – they’re coming for you. If you are under the age of 26 on your parents coverage, they’re coming for you."
PAGE," Senator Harris, thank you."
HARRIS, You’re welcome.
PAGE, Let me give you a chance to respond.
PENCE," Well I hope we have a chance to talk about health care because Obamacare was a disaster and the American people remember it well. President Trump and I have a plan to improve health care and to protect, protect pre-existing conditions for every American. But look, Senator Harris, you’re entitled to your own opinion but you’re not entitled to your own facts –"
HARRIS, That’s a good line.
PENCE," You yourself said on multiple occasions when you were running for president that you would ban fracking. Joe Biden looked his supporter in the eye and pointed and said “I guarantee, I guarantee that we will abolish fossil fuels.” We have a $2 trillion version of the Green New Deal, Susan, that your newspaper USA TODAY said really wasn’t that very different from the original Green New Deal. More taxes, more regulation, banning fracking, abolishing fossil fuel, crushing American energy and economic surrender to China is a prescription for economic decline. President Trump and I will keep America growing. The V-shape recovery that’s underway right now will continue with four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House."
PAGE," Thank you very, very much, Vice President Pence. Once again you provided the perfect segue to a new topic, which is climate change. And Vice President Pence, I’d like to pose the first question to you. This year we’ve seen record-setting hurricanes in the south. Another one, Hurricane Delta is now threatening the gulf. And we have seen record-setting wildfires in the West. Do you believe, as the scientific community has concluded, that man-made climate change has made wildfires bigger, hotter and more deadly? And it made hurricanes wetter, slower and more damaging? You have two minutes, uninterrupted."
PENCE," Thank you Susan. Well first, I’m very proud of our record on the environment and on conservation. According to all of the best estimates, our, our air and land are cleaner than any time ever recorded. And our water is among the cleanest in the world. And just a little while ago, the president signed the Outdoors Act, the largest investment in our public lands and public parks in 100 years. So, President Trump has made a commitment to conservation and to the environment. Now with regard to climate change, the climate is changing. But the issue is, what’s the cause and what do we do about it. President Trump has made it clear that we’re going to continue to listen to the science. Now Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, would put us back in the Paris Climate Accord. They’d impose the Green New Deal, which would crush American energy, would increase the energy cost of American families in their homes and literally would crush American jobs. President Trump and I believe that the progress that we have made in a cleaner environment has been happening precisely because we have a strong free market economy. You know what’s remarkable is the United States has reduced CO2 more than the countries that are still in the Paris Climate Accord, but we’ve done it through innovation. And we’ve done it through natural gas and fracking, which, Senator, the American people can go look at the record. I know Joe Biden says otherwise now, as you do, but the both of you repeatedly committed to abolishing fossil fuel and banning fracking."
HARRIS, That’s not true.
PENCE," And so by creating the kind of American innovation, we’re actually steering toward a stronger and better environment. With regard to wildfires, President Trump and I believe that forest management has to be front and center, and even Governor Gavin Newsome from your state has agreed we’ve got to work on forest management. And with regard to hurricanes, the National Oceanic Administration tells us that actually as, as difficult as they are –"
PAGE," Thank you – Thank you, Vice President –"
PENCE, – there are no more hurricanes today than there were 100 years ago –
PAGE, Thank you – Thank you –
PENCE, – but many of the climate alarmists use hurricanes and wildfires to try and –
PAGE," Vice President Pence, I’m sorry, your time is up – Thank you, Vice President Pence –"
PENCE, – sell the bill of goods of a Green New Deal. And President Trump and I are gonna always put American jobs and American workers first.
PAGE," Thank you, Vice President Pence. Senator Harris, as the Vice President mentioned, you co-sponsored the Green New Deal in Congress, but Vice President Biden said in last week’s debate that he does not support the Green New Deal. But if you look at the Biden Harris campaign website it describes the Green New Deal as a crucial framework. What exactly would be the stance of a Biden Harris Administration toward the Green New Deal? You have two minutes, uninterrupted."
HARRIS," Alright, so first of all, I will repeat, and the American people know, that Joe Biden will not ban fracking. That is a fact. That is a fact. I will repeat that Joe Biden has been very clear that he thinks about growing jobs, which is why he will not increase taxes for anyone who makes less than $400,000 a year. Joe Biden’s economic plan – Moody’s, which is a reputable Wall Street firm – has said will create 7 million more jobs than Donald Trump’s. And part of those jobs, that will be created by Joe Biden, are going to be about clean energy and renewable energy. Because you see, Joe understands that the West Coast of our country is burning, including my home state of California. Joe sees what is happening on the Gulf states, which are being battered by storms. Joe has seen and talked with the farmers in Iowa, whose entire crops have been destroyed because of floods. And so Joe believes, again, in science. I’ll tell you something, Susan, I served, when I first got to the Senate, on the committee that’s responsible for the environment. Do you know this administration took the word science off the website? And then took the phrase climate change off the website? This– We have seen a pattern with this administration which is they don’t believe in science. And Joe’s plan is about saying we’re going to deal with it, but we’re also going to create jobs. Donald Trump, when asked about the wildfires in California and the question was, you know, the science is telling us this, you know what Donald Trump said? Science doesn’t know. So, let’s talk about who is prepared to lead our country over the course of the next four years on what is an existential threat to us as human beings. Joe is about saying we’re going to invest that in renewable energy, we’re going to be about the creation of millions of jobs, we will achieve net zero emissions by 2050, carbon neutral by 2035– Joe has a plan. This has been a lot of talk from the Trump administration, and really it has been to go backward instead of forward. We will also reenter the climate agreement with pride."
PAGE," Senator Harris just said that climate change is an existential threat. Vice President Pence, do you believe that climate change poses an existential threat?"
PENCE," As I said, Susan, the climate is changing. We’ll follow the science, but, once again, Senator Harris is denying the fact that they’re gonna raise taxes on every American. Joe Biden said twice in the debate last week that on day one he was going to repeal the Trump tax cuts. Those tax cuts delivered $2,000 in tax relief to the average family of four across America. And with regard to banning fracking, I just recommend that people look at the record. You yourself said repeatedly that you would ban fracking. You were the first senate co-sponsor of the Green New Deal. And while Joe Biden denied the Green New Deal, Susan, thank you for pointing out, the Green New Deal is on their campaign website. And as USA TODAY said, it’s essentially the same plan as you co-sponsored with AOC when she submitted it in the Senate. And you just heard the senator say that she’s going to resubmit America to the Paris Climate Accord. Look, the American people have always cherished our environment. We will continue to cherish it. We’ve made great progress reducing CO2 emissions through American innovation and the development of natural gas through fracking. We don’t need a massive, $2 trillion Green New Deal that would impose all new mandates on American businesses and American families, Joe Biden wants us to retrofit 4 million–"
PAGE," Thank you – Thank you, Vice President Pence –"
PENCE, – American business buildings. It makes no sense. It will cost jobs. President Trump –
PAGE," Thank you, Vice President Pence –"
PENCE, – he’s gonna put America first. He’s going to put jobs first and we’re gonna take care of our environment and follow the science.
PAGE," Thank you, Vice President Pence –"
HARRIS, On the issue of jobs –
PAGE, Senator Harris
HARRIS," Let’s talk about that. You, the Vice President earlier referred to, as part of what he thinks is an accomplishment, the President’s trade war with China. You lost that trade war. You lost it. What ended up happening is, because of a so-called trade war with China, America lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs. Farmers have experienced bankruptcy, because of it. We are in a manufacturing recession, because of it. And when we look at where this administration has been, there are estimates that by the end of the term of this administration, they will have lost more jobs than almost any other presidential administration –"
PENCE, Susan –
HARRIS," – And the American people know what I’m talking about. You know. I think about 20-year-olds, you know we have a 20-year-old, 20-something-year-old, who are coming out of high school and college right now and you’re wondering, “Is there going to be a job there for me?”. We’re looking at people who are trying to figure out how they’re going to pay rent by the end of the month. Almost half of American renters are worried about whether they’re going to be able to pay rent by the end of the month. This is where the economy is in America right now and it is because of the catastrophe and the failure of leadership of this administration."
PAGE," Thank you, Senator Harris. Vice President Pence, let me give you just 15 seconds to respond because then I want to move on."
PENCE," Well, I’d love to respond. Look, lost the trade war with China? Joe Biden never fought it. Joe Biden has been a cheerleader for Communist China through over the last several decades. And, and again, Senator Harris, you’re entitled to your opinion, you’re not entitled to your own facts. When Joe Biden was vice president, we lost 200,000 manufacturing jobs and President Obama said they were never coming back. He said we needed a magic wand to bring them back. In our first three years, after we cut taxes, rolled back regulation –"
PAGE," Thank you, Vice President Pence –"
PENCE," – unleashed American energy, this administration saw 500,000 manufacturing jobs created –"
PAGE," Thank you, Vice President Pence –"
PENCE, – And that’s exactly the kind of growth we’re going to continue to see as we bring our nation through this pandemic –
PAGE," Thank you, Vice President Pence – Thank you, Vice President Pence –"
PENCE," – your Green New Deal, your massive new mandates, your Paris Climate Accord, it’s gonna kill jobs this time just like it killed jobs in the last administration."
HARRIS," Susan, I just need to respond very briefly, please."
PAGE, 15 seconds and then we’ll move on.
HARRIS, Thank you. Thank you. Joe Biden is responsible for saving America’s auto industry and you voted against it. So let’s set the record straight. Thank you.
PAGE," I’d like to talk about China. We have, as our next topic, we have no more complicated or consequential foreign relationship than the one with China. It is a huge market for American agricultural goods. It’s a potential partner in dealing with climate change and North Korea. And in a video tonight, President Trump again blamed it for the coronavirus, saying “China will pay.” Vice President Pence, how would you describe our, our fundamental relationship with China? Competitors? Adversaries? Enemies? You have two minutes."
PENCE," Thank you Susan. Well let me, before I leave that, let me, let me speak to voting records, if I can. You know, everybody knows that NAFTA caused literally thousands of American factories to close. We saw automotive jobs go south of the border. President Trump fought to renegotiate NAFTA, and the United States, Mexico, Canada agreement is now the law of the land. American people deserve to know Senator Kamala Harris was one of only 10 members of the Senate to vote against the USMCA. It was a huge win for American auto workers. It was a huge win for American farmers, especially dairy in the upper Midwest. But, Senator, you said it didn’t go far enough on climate change, that you put your, your radical environmental agenda ahead of American auto workers and ahead of American jobs. I think the American people deserve to know that. It’s probably why Newsweek magazine said that, that Kamala Harris was the most liberal member of the United States Senate in 2019, more liberal than Bernie Sanders, more, more liberal than any of the others in the United States Senate. So, now with regard to China, Susan, first and foremost — China is to blame for the coronavirus. And President Trump is not happy about it. He’s made that very clear. He made it clear again today. China and the World Health Organization did not play straight with the American people. They did not let our personnel into China to get information on the coronavirus until the middle of February. Fortunately, President Trump, in dealing with China from the outset of this administration — standing up to China, that had been taking advantage of America for decades — in the wake of Joe Biden’s cheerleading for China, President Trump made that decision before the end of January to suspend all travel from China. And again, the American people deserve to know, Joe Biden opposed President Trump’s decision to suspend all travel from China. He said it was hysterical, he said it was xenophobic –"
PAGE," Thank you, Vice President Pence – Vice President Pence, your time is up –"
PENCE, – but President Trump has stood up to China and will continue to stand strong.
PAGE," Thank you, Vice President Pence –"
PENCE," We want to improve the relationship, but we’re going to level the playing field and we’re going to hold China accountable for what they did to America with the coronavirus."
PAGE," Thank you. Senator Harris, let me ask you the same question that I asked the Vice President. How would you describe our fundamental relationship with China? Are we competitors, adversaries, enemies? You’ll have two minutes, uninterrupted."
HARRIS," Susan, the Trump administration’s perspective, and approach to China has resulted in the loss of American lives, American jobs and America’s standing. There is a weird obsession that President Trump has had with getting rid of whatever accomplishment was achieved by President Obama and Vice President Biden. For example, they created, within the White House, an office that basically was responsible for monitoring pandemics. They got away, they got rid of it."
PENCE, Not true.
HARRIS," There was a team of disease experts that President Obama and Vice President Biden dispatched to China to monitor what is now predictable and what might happen. They pulled them out. We now are looking at 210,000 Americans who have lost their lives. Let’s look at the job situation we mentioned before, the trade deal – the trade war, they wanted to call it – with China. It resulted in the loss of over 300 manufacturing jobs, and a manufacturing recession, and the American consumer paying thousands of dollars more for goods, because of that failed war, that they called it. And let’s talk about standing. Pew, a reputable research firm, has done an analysis that shows that leaders of all of our formerly allied countries have now decided that they hold in greater esteem and respect Xi Jinping, the head of the Chinese Communist Party, than they do Donald Trump, the President of the United States, the commander in chief of the United States. This is where we are today, because of a failure of leadership by this administration."
PAGE," Senator Harris, we’ve seen changes in the role of the United States, in terms of global leadership, over the past four years – and of course times do change. What’s your definition – we’ve seen strains with China, of course, as the Vice President mentioned, we’ve seen strains with our traditional allies in NATO and elsewhere. What is your definition of the role of American leadership in 2020?"
HARRIS," So, you know Joe is – I love talking with Joe about a lot of these issues, and you know, Joe, I think, he said it, quite well. He says, you know, ‘Foreign policy: it might sound complicated, but really it’s relationships, they’re – just think about it as relationships. And so we know this, in our personal, professional relationships – you gotta keep your word to your friends. Got to be loyal to your friends. People who have stood with you, got to stand with them. You got to know who your adversaries are, and keep them in check. But what we have seen with Donald Trump is that he has betrayed our friends and embraced dictators around the world. Let’s take for example, Russia. So, Russia – I serve on the Intelligence Committee of the United States Senate. America’s intelligence community told us Russia interfered in the election of the President of the United States in 2016 and is playing in 2020. Christopher Wray, the director of the FBI, said the same, but Donald Trump, the commander in chief of the United States of America prefers to take the word of Vladimir Putin over the word of the American intelligence community. You look at our friends at NATO. He has walked away from agreements – you can look at the Iran nuclear deal, which now has put us in a position where we are less safe, because they are building up what might end up being a significant nuclear arsenal. We were in that deal, guys, we were in the Iran nuclear deal with friends, with allies around the country, and because of Donald Trump’s unilateral approach to foreign policy, coupled with his isolationism, he pulled us out and has made America less safe. So Susan, it’s about relationships. And the thing that has always been part of the strength of our nation, in addition to our great military, has been that we keep our word. But Donald Trump doesn’t understand that, because he doesn’t understand what it means to be honest."
PAGE," Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Senator Harris. Vice President Pence, let me give you a chance to respond."
PENCE," Well, thank you. Well, President Trump kept his word when we moved the American Embassy to Jerusalem, the capital of the State of Israel. When Joe Biden was vice president, they promised to do that and never did. We’ve stood strong with our allies, but we’ve been demanding. NATO is now contributing more to our common defense than ever before. Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, we’ve strengthen our alliances across the Asia Pacific. And we’ve stood strong against those who would do us harm. You know when President Trump came into office, ISIS had captured an area of the Middle East, the size of Pennsylvania. President Trump unleashed the American military, and our armed forces destroyed the ISIS caliphate and took down their leader al Baghdadi without one American casualty. al Baghdadi was responsible for the death of thousands. But notably, America’s hearts today are with the family of Kayla Mueller, the parents of which are here with us tonight in Salt Lake City. Today, two of the ISIS killers responsible for Kayla Mueller’s murder, were brought to justice in the United States. Jihadi John was killed on the battlefield, along with the other few. The reality is that when Joe Biden was vice president, we had an opportunity to save Kayla Mueller. Breaks my heart to reflect on it, but the military came into the Oval Office, presented a plan. They said they knew where Kayla was. Baghdadi had held her for 18 months, abused her mercilessly before they killed her. But when Joe Biden was vice president, they hesitated for a month. And when Armed Forces finally went in, it was clear she’d been moved two days earlier, and her family says — with a heart that broke the heart of every American — that if President Donald Trump had been president, they believe Kayla would be alive today."
PAGE," Thank you, Vice President."
PENCE," We destroyed the ISIS caliphate. And you talk about reentering the Iran nuclear deal. I mean, the last administration transferred $1.8 billion to the leading state sponsor of terrorism –"
PAGE," Thank you, Vice President."
PENCE," President Donald Trump got us out of the deal, and when Qasim Soleimani was traveling to Baghdad, to do harm to Americans, President Donald Trump took him out. And America is safer, our allies are safer and the American people should know –"
PAGE," Thank you, Vice President. I would like to give Senator Harris a chance to respond, but not at such great length because of course there are other topics we want to talk about."
HARRIS, But I would like equal time.
PENCE, Yes. Please go ahead.
HARRIS," First of all, to the Mueller family, I know about your daughter’s case, and I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry. What happened to her is awful. And it should have never happened. And I know Joe feels the same way. And I know that President Obama feels the same way. But you mentioned Soleimani. Let’s start there. So, after the strike on Soleimani, there was a counter strike on our troops in Iraq. And they suffered serious brain injuries, and do you know what Donald Trump dismissed them as? Headaches. And this is about a pattern of Donald Trump’s, where he has referred to our men who are serving in our military, as suckers and losers. Donald Trump, who went to Arlington Cemetery, and stood above the graves of our fallen heroes and said, ‘What’s in it for them?’ Because, of course, you know he only thinks about what’s in it for him. Let’s take what he said about John McCain. A great American hero. And Donald Trump says he doesn’t deserve to be called a hero because he was a prisoner of war. Take – and this is, this is very important. When you want to talk about who is the current commander in chief, and what they care about and what they don’t care about. Public reporting that Russia had bounties on the heads of American soldiers, and you know what a bounty is? Somebody puts a price on your head, and they will pay it if you are killed. And Donald Trump had talked at least six times to Vladmir Putin, and never brought up the subject. Joe Biden would never do that. Joe Biden – Joe Biden would hold Russia to account for any threat to our nation’s security or to our troops who are sacrificing their lives for the sake of our democracy and our safety."
PAGE," Thank you, Senator Harris. This is such an important issue, but we have other important issues as well and I want to make sure we have a chance."
PENCE, I really have to respond to that. She has –
PAGE," Fifteen seconds, because –"
PENCE," Well, I’ve got to have more than that."
PAGE," I’m sorry, Mr. Vice President, you’ve had more time than she’s had, so far –"
PENCE, The slanders against President Donald Trump regarding men and women of our armed forces are absurd.
PAGE," I’m sorry, Vice President Pence –"
PENCE," My son is a captain in the United States Marine Corps, my son in law is deployed in the United States Navy. I can assure all of you with sons and daughters serving in our military, President Donald Trump not only respects but reveres all of those who served in our armed forces, and any suggestion otherwise is ridiculous. Let me also say –"
PAGE," Vice President Pence. Vice President Pence. I didn’t – Vice President Pence – I did not create the rules for tonight. Your campaigns agreed to the rules for tonight’s debate, with the Commission on Presidential Debates. I’m here to enforce them, which involves moving from one topic to another, giving roughly equal time to both of you, which is what I’m trying very hard to do. So I want to go ahead and move to the next topic, which is an important one, as the last topic was, and that is the Supreme Court. On Monday, the Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to open hearings on Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination to the Supreme Court. Senator Harris, you’ll be there as a member of the committee. Her confirmation would cement the court’s conservative majority, and make it likely open to more abortion restrictions, even to overturning the landmark Roe v Wade ruling. Access to abortion would then be up to the states. Vice President Pence, you’re the former governor of Indiana. If Roe v Wade is overturned, what would you want Indiana to do? Would you want your home state to ban all abortions? You have two minutes, uninterrupted."
PENCE," Well thank you for the question, but I’ll use a little bit of my time to respond to that very important issue before. The American people deserve to know, Quasem Soleimani, the Iranian general, was responsible for the death of hundreds of American servicemembers. When the opportunity came, we saw him headed to Baghdad to kill more Americans, President Trump didn’t hesitate and Quasem Soleimani is gone. But you deserve to know that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris actually criticized the decision to take out Quasem Soleimani. It’s really inexplicable, but with regard to Joe Biden it’s explainable, because history records that Joe Biden actually opposed the raid against Osama bin Laden. It’s absolutely essential that we have a commander in chief who will not hesitate to act to protect American lives and to protect American servicemembers, and that’s what you have in President Donald Trump. Now with regard to the Supreme Court of the United States. Let me say, President Trump and I could not be more enthusiastic about the opportunity to see Judge Amy Coney Barrett become Justice Amy Coney Barrett. She’s a brilliant woman, and she will bring a lifetime of experience and a sizable American family, to the Supreme Court of the United States. And our hope is, in the hearing next week, unlike Justice Kavanaugh received with treatment from you and others. We hope she gets a fair hearing. And we particularly hope that we don’t see the kind of attacks on her Christian faith that we saw before. Democratic Chairman of the Judiciary Committee before, when Judge Barrett was being confirmed for the Court of Appeals, expressed concern that the “dogma of her faith lived loudly in her.” Dick Durbin of Illinois said that it was a concern. Senator, I know one of our judicial nominees, you actually attacked because they were a member of the Catholic Knights of Columbus, just because the Knights of Columbus holds pro-life views."
PAGE," Thank you. Thank you, Vice President Pence, your time is up."
PENCE," My hope is that when the hearing takes place, that Judge Amy Coney Barrett will be respected –"
PAGE, Thank you Vice President.
PENCE, – treated respectfully and voted and confirmed to the Supreme Court of United States.
PAGE," Senator Harris, you’re the senator from and former Attorney General of California. So let me ask you a parallel question to the one I posed to the vice president. If Roe v Wade is overturned, what would you want California to do? Would you want your home state to enact no restrictions on access to abortion? And you have two minutes, uninterrupted."
PENCE," Thank you, Susan. First of all, Joe Biden and I are both people of faith. And it’s insulting to suggest that we would knock anyone for their faith, and in fact, Joe if elected will be only the second practicing Catholic, as President of the United States. On the issue of this nomination – Joe and I are very clear, as are the majority of the American people. We are 27 days before the decision about who will be the next president of the United States. And you know before, when this conversation has come up, you know it’s been about election year or election time. We’re literally in an election. Over 4 million people have voted. People are in the process of voting right now. And so Joe has been very clear, as the American people are: Let the American people fill that seat in the White House, and then we’ll fill that seat on the United States Supreme Court. And to your point, Susan, the issues before us couldn’t be more serious. There’s the issue of choice, and I will always fight for a woman’s right to make a decision about her own body. It should be her decision and not that of Donald Trump, and the Vice President, Michael Pence. But let’s also look at what else is before the court. It’s the Affordable Care Act. Like, literally in the midst of a public health pandemic – when over 210,000 people have died and 7 million people probably have what will be in the future considered a pre-existing condition because you contracted the virus – Donald Trump is in court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. And I’ve said it before and it bears repeating: This means that there will be no more protections, if they win, for people with pre-existing conditions. This means that over 20 million people will lose your coverage. It means that if you’re under the age of 26, you can’t stay on your parents coverage anymore. And here’s the thing. The contrast couldn’t be more clear. They’re trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Joe Biden is saying let’s expand coverage, let’s give you a choice of a public option or private coverage, let’s bring down premiums, let’s lower Medicare eligibility to 60. That’s true leadership."
PAGE," You know, you mentioned earlier, Vice President Pence, that the President was committed to maintaining protections for people with pre-existing conditions and — but you do have this court case that you are supporting, your administration is supporting, that would strike down the Affordable Care Act. The president says, President Trump says, that he’s going to protect people with pre-existing conditions, but he has not explained how he will do that. And that was one of the toughest nuts to crack, when they were passing the Affordable Care Act. So, tell us, specifically – how would your administration protect Americans with pre-existing conditions, have access to affordable insurance if the Affordable Care Act is struck down."
PENCE," Well, thank you, Susan. Let me just say, addressing your very first question, I couldn’t be more proud to serve as vice president to a President who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life. I’m pro-life. I don’t apologize for it. And this is another one of those cases where there’s such a dramatic contrast. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris support taxpayer funding of abortion, all the way up to the moment of birth, late-term abortion. They want to increase funding to Planned Parenthood of America. Now for our part, I would never presume how Judge Amy Coney Barrett would rule on the Supreme Court of the United States but we’ll continue to stand strong for the right to life. When you speak about the Supreme Court, though, I think the American people really deserve an answer, Senator Harris. Are you and Joe Biden gonna pack the court if Judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed? I mean, there have been 29 vacancies on the Supreme Court during presidential election years, from George Washington to Barack Obama. Presidents have nominated in all 29 cases. But your party is actually openly advocating adding seats to the Supreme Court, which has had nine seats for 150 years, if you don’t get your way. This is a classic case of if you can’t win by the rules, you’re going to change the rules. Now you’ve refused to answer the question, Joe Biden has refused to answer the question. I think the American people would really like to know. If Judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed to the Supreme Court of the United States, are you and Joe Biden, if somehow you win this election, going to pack the Supreme Court to get your way?"
HARRIS, I’m so glad we went through a little history lesson. Let’s do that a little more. In 1864 –
PENCE," Well, I’d like you to answer the question."
HARRIS," Mr. Vice President, I’m speaking. I’m speaking. In 1864, one of the, I think, political heroes – certainly of the president, and I assume of you also, Mr. Vice President – is Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln was up for reelection, and it was 27 days before the election, and a seat became open on the United States Supreme Court. Abraham Lincoln’s party was in charge, not only in the White House, but the Senate. But honest Abe said it’s not the right thing to do. The American people deserve to make the decision about who will be the next President of the United States, and then that person can select who will serve for a lifetime on the highest court of our land. And so Joe and I are very clear: the American people are voting right now. And it should be their decision about who will serve on this most important body for a lifetime."
PAGE," Thank you, Senator Harris and –"
PENCE," Well, Susan. People are voting right now. They’d like to know if you and Joe Biden are gonna pack the Supreme Court if you don’t get your way in this nomination."
HARRIS, Let’s talk about packing –
PENCE," Once again, you gave a non-answer, Joe Biden gave a non-answer."
HARRIS, I’m trying to answer you now. 
PENCE," The people deserve a straight answer. And if you haven’t figured it out yet, the straight answer is they are going to pack the Supreme Court if they somehow win this election. I gotta tell you, people across this country, if you cherish our Supreme Court, if you cherish the separation of powers, you need to reject the Biden-Harris ticket come November the third and reelect President Donald Trump. We will stand by that separation powers and a nine seat Supreme Court."
HARRIS, Let’s talk about packing the court then. Let’s talk about.
PENCE, Please –
HARRIS," Yeah, I’m about to. So, the Trump-Pence administration has been – because I sit on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Susan, as you mentioned. And I’ve witnessed the appointments, for lifetime appointments to the federal courts, district courts, Courts of Appeal — people who are purely ideological people who have been reviewed by legal professional organizations and found to have been not competent, are substandard. And do you know that of the 50 people who President Trump appointed to the Court of Appeals for lifetime appointments, not one is Black? This is what they’ve been doing. You want to talk about packing a court? Let’s have that discussion."
PAGE," All right, thank you. Thank you, Senator. Let’s go on and talk about the issue of racial justice."
PENCE," I just want the record to reflect, she never answered the question. Maybe the next debate Joe Biden will answer the question. But I think the American people know the answer."
PAGE," Thank you, Vice President. In March, Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency room technician in Louisville, was shot and killed after police officers executing a search warrant on a narcotics investigation broke into her apartment. The police said they identified themselves. Taylor’s boyfriend said he didn’t hear them do that. He used a gun registered to him to fire a shot, which wounded an officer. The officers then fired more than 20 rounds into the apartment. They say they were acting in self-defense. None of them have been indicted in connection with her death. Senator Harris, in the case of Breonna Taylor, was justice done? You have two minutes."
HARRIS," I don’t believe so, and I’ve talked with Breonna’s mother, Tamika Palmer, and her family, and her family deserves justice. She was a beautiful young woman. She had as her life goal to become a nurse, and she wanted to become an EMT to first learn what’s going on out on the street, so she could then become a nurse and save lives. And her life was taken, unjustifiably and tragically and violently. And it just, it brings me to, you know, the eight minutes and 46 seconds that America witnessed, during which an American man was tortured and killed under the knee of an armed, uniformed police officer. And people around our country, of every race, of every age, of every gender – perfect strangers to each other – marched shoulder to shoulder, arm and arm, fighting for us to finally achieve that ideal of equal justice under law. And I was a part of those peaceful protests. And I believe strongly that, first of all, we are never going to condone violence, but we always must fight for the values that we hold dear, including the fight to achieve our ideals. And that’s why Joe Biden and I have said on this subject, look, and I’m a former career prosecutor. I know what I’m talking about. Bad cops are bad for good cops. We need reform of our policing in America and our criminal justice system, which is why Joe and I will immediately ban chokeholds and carotid holds. George Floyd would be alive today if we did that. We will require a national registry for police officers who break the law, we will – on the issue of criminal justice reform – get rid of private prisons and cash bail and we will decriminalize marijuana, and we will expunge the records of those who have been convicted of marijuana. This is a time for leadership. On a tragic, tragic issue…"
PAGE," Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Senator Harris. Vice President Pence, let me pose the same question to you. In the case of Breonna Taylor, was justice done? You have two minutes, uninterrupted."
PENCE," Well our heart breaks for the loss of any innocent American life, and the family of Breonna Taylor has our sympathies. But I trust our justice system, a grand jury that reviews the evidence. And it really is remarkable, that as a former prosecutor, you would assume that in a panel grand jury, looking at all the evidence, got it wrong. But you’re entitled to your opinion, Senator. And with regard to George Floyd, there’s no excuse for what happened to George Floyd. Justice will be served. But there’s also no excuse for the rioting and looting that followed. I mean, it really is astonishing. Flora Westbrook is with us here tonight in Salt Lake City. Just a few weeks ago, I stood at what used to be her salon, was burned to the ground. By rioters and looters. And Flora is still trying to put her life back together. And I must tell ya, this, this presumption that you hear consistently from Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, that America is systemically racist. That as Joe Biden said, that he believes that law enforcement has an implicit bias against minorities, is a great insult to the men and women who serve in law enforcement. And I want everyone to know, who puts on the uniform of law enforcement every day, that President Trump and I stand with you. It is remarkable that when Senator Tim Scott tried to pass a police reform bill, brought together a group of Republicans and Democrats – Senator Harris, you got up and walked out of the room. And then you filibustered Senator Tim Scott’s bill on the Senate floor that would have provided new accountability, new resources. But we don’t have to choose between supporting law enforcement, improving public safety, and supporting our African American neighbors and all of our minorities. Under President Trump’s leadership –"
PAGE," Thank you, Mr. Vice President"
PENCE," – we will always stand with law enforcement and we’ll do what we’ve done from day one which is improve the lives of African Americans. Record unemployment, record investments in education – "
PAGE," Thank you, Mr. Vice President."
PENCE," – Fight for school choice, for –"
PAGE, Senator Harris.
HARRIS," I will not sit here and be lectured by the Vice President on what it means to enforce the laws of our country. I am the only one on this stage who has personally prosecuted everything from child sexual assault to homicide. I’m the only one on this stage who has prosecuted the big banks for taking advantage of America’s homeowners. I am the only one on this stage who prosecuted for-profit colleges for taking advantage of our veterans. And the reality of this is, that we are talking about an election in 27 days where last week, the President of the United States took a debate stage in front of 70 million Americans and refused to condemn white supremacists. And –"
PENCE, Not true.
HARRIS," – it wasn’t like he didn’t have a chance. He didn’t do it, and then he doubled down. And then he said, when pressed, ‘Stand back. Stand by.’ And this is a part of a pattern of Donald Trump’s. He was – he called Mexicans rapists and criminals. He instituted as his first act a Muslim ban. He, on the issue of Charlottesville, where people were peacefully protesting the need for racial justice, where a young woman was killed and on the other side there were neo-Nazis carrying tiki torches shouting racial epithets, anti semitic slurs. And Donald Trump, when asked about it, said there were fine people on both sides. This is who we have as the President of the United States. And America, you deserve better. Joe Biden will be a president who brings our country together."
PAGE, Senator Harris –
HARRIS, – and recognizes the beauty in our diversity and the fact that we all have so much more in common than what separates us.
PAGE," Vice President Pence, let me give you a minute to respond."
PENCE," Thank you, Susan. I appreciate that very much. I think that’s one of the things that makes people dislike the media so much in this country, Susan. That you selectively edit, just like Senator Harris did, comments that President Trump and I, and others on our side of the aisle make. Senator Harris conveniently omitted, after the President made comments about people on either side of the debate over monuments, he condemned the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists and has done so repeatedly. Your concern that he doesn’t condemn neo-Nazis – President Trump has Jewish grandchildren. His daughter and son-in-law are Jewish. This is a president who respects and cherishes all of the American people. But you talk about having personally prosecuted – I’m glad you brought up your record, Senator."
PAGE, Thank you.
PENCE," I really need to make this point. When you were DA in San Francisco, when you left office, African Americans were 19 times more likely to be prosecuted for minor drug offenses than whites and Hispanics. When you were Attorney General of California, you increased the disproportionate incarceration of Blacks in California. You did nothing on criminal justice reform in California. You didn’t lift a finger to pass the first step back on Capitol Hill. The reality is, your record speaks for itself. President Trump and I have fought for criminal justice, for –"
PAGE," Thank you, Vice President Pence"
PENCE, – fought for educational choice and opportunities for African Americans –
PAGE," Thank you, sir."
PENCE, And we’ll do it for four more.
PAGE," Thank you. You know there is no more important issue than the final issue that we’re going to talk about tonight, and that is the issue of the election itself."
HARRIS," Susan, he attacked my record. I would like an opportunity to respond."
PAGE, Let me give you 30 seconds because we’re running out of time.
HARRIS," I appreciate that. First of all, having served as the Attorney General of the State of California, the work that I did is a model of what our nation needs to do and we will be able to do under a Joe Biden presidency. Our agenda includes what this administration has failed to do. It will be about not only instituting a ban on chokeholds and carotid holes."
PAGE, Thank you.
HARRIS, I would like to go through –
PAGE, These are points that you made earlier in the hour and I want to talk about the election itself before we have to –
HARRIS," But I want to talk about the connection between what Joe and I will do and my record, which includes – I was the first statewide officer to institute a requirement that my agents would wear body cameras and keep them on full time. We were the first to initiate a requirement that there would be a training for law enforcement on implicit bias, because yes, Joe Biden and I recognize that implicit bias does exist, Mr. Vice President, contrary to what you may believe. We did the work of instituting reforms that were about investing in reentry. This is the work that we have done and the work we will do going forward and, again, I will not be lectured by the Vice President, on our record of what we have done in terms of law enforcement and keeping our community safe and a commitment to reforming the criminal justice system of America."
PAGE," Thank you, Senator Harris, and I’d like to pose the – I’d like you to respond first to the question on our final topic, the election itself. President Trump has, several times, refused to commit himself to a peaceful transfer of power after the election. If your ticket wins and President Trump refuses to accept a peaceful transfer of power, what steps would you and Vice President Biden then take? What would happen next? You have two minutes."
HARRIS," So, I’ll tell you. Joe and I are particularly proud of the coalition that we’ve built around our campaign. We probably have one of the broadest coalitions of folks that you’ve ever seen in a presidential race. Of course we have the support of Democrats, but also independents and Republicans, in fact, seven members of President George W. Bush’s cabinet are supporting our ticket. We have the support of Colin Powell, Cindy McCain, John Kasich, over 500 generals, retired generals, and former national security experts and advisors are supporting our campaign. And I believe they are doing that because they know that Joe Biden has a deep, deep seated commitment to fight for our democracy, and to fight for the integrity of our democracy, and to bring integrity back to the White House. And so, we believe in the American people. We believe in our democracy. And here’s what I’d like to say to everybody: vote. Please vote, vote early, come up with a plan to vote, go to IWillVote.com. You can also go to Joe Biden.com. We have it within our power in these next 27 days to make the decision about what will be the course of our country for the next four years. And it is within our power, and if we use our vote, and we use our voice, we will win. And we will not let anyone subvert our democracy, with what Donald Trump has been doing as he did on the debate stage last week, when again in front of 70 million people, he openly attempted to suppress the vote. Joe Biden, on the other hand, on that same debate stage – because clearly Donald Trump doesn’t think he can run on a record because it’s a failed record – Joe Biden on that stage, said, ‘Hey, just please vote.’ So I’ll repeat what Joe said. Please vote."
PAGE," Thank you, Senator. Vice President Pence, President Trump has several times refused to commit himself to a peaceful transfer of power after the election. If Vice President Biden is declared the winner and President Trump refuses to accept a peaceful transfer of power, what would be your role and responsibility as Vice President? What would you personally do? You have two minutes."
PENCE," Well, Susan, first and foremost, I think we’re gonna win this election. Because while Joe Biden and Kamala Harris rattle off a long litany, the establishment in Washington DC and the establishment Joe Biden’s been a part of for 47 years. President Donald Trump has launched a movement of everyday Americans from every walk of life. And I have every confidence that the same Americans that delivered that historic victory in 2016, they see this President’s record, where we rebuild our military, we revived our economy through tax cuts and rolling back regulation, fighting for fair trade, unleashing American energy. We appointed conservatives to our federal courts at every level. And we stood with the men and women of law enforcement every single day, and I think, I think that movement of Americans has only grown stronger in the last four years. When you talk about accepting the outcome of the election, I must tell you, Senator, your party has spent the last three and a half years trying to overturn the results of the last election. It’s amazing. When Joe Biden was vice president of the United States, the FBI actually spied on President Trump and my campaign. I mean there were documents released this week that the CIA actually made a referral to the FBI documenting that those allegations were coming from the Hillary Clinton campaign, and of course, we’ve all seen the avalanche with the — what, what you put the country through, for the better part of three years, until it was found that there was no obstruction, no collusion, case closed. And then Senator Harris, you and your colleagues in the Congress tried to impeach the President of the United States, over a phone call. And now Hillary Clinton has actually said to Joe Biden that under, in her words, under no circumstances should he concede the election. So let me just say, I think we’re gonna win this election. President Trump and I are fighting every day in courthouses to prevent Joe Biden and Kamala Harris from changing the rules and creating this universal mail-in voting, that’ll create a massive opportunity for voter fraud. We have a free and fair election; we know we’re going to have confidence in it. And I believe in all my heart that President Donald Trump’s gonna be reelected for four more years."
PAGE," You know I’ve, I’ve asked – I’ve written all the questions that I’ve asked tonight, but for the final question of the debate, I’d like to read a question that someone else wrote. The Utah Debate Commission asked students in the state to write essays about what they would like to ask you. And I want to close tonight’s debate with the question posed by Brecklynn Brown. She’s an eighth grader at Springville Junior High in Springville, Utah, and here’s what she wrote. Quote – “When I watch the news, all I see is arguing between Democrats and Republicans. When I watch the news, all I see is citizen fighting against citizen. When I watch the news, all I see are two candidates from opposing parties, trying to tear each other down. If our leaders can’t get along, how are the citizens supposed to get along?” And then she added, “Your examples could make all the difference to bring us together” – end quote. So to each of you, in turn, I’d like you to take one minute, and respond to Brecklynn. Vice President Pence, you have one minute."
PENCE," Brecklynn, it’s a wonderful question. And let me just commend you for taking an interest in public life. I started following the news when I was very young. And in America, we believe in a free and open exchange of debate. And we celebrate that, and it’s how we’ve created literally the freest and most prosperous nation in the history of the world. I would tell you that – don’t assume that what you’re seeing on your local news networks is synonymous with the American people. You know, I look at the relationship between Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the late justice who we just lost from the Supreme Court, and the late Justice Antonin Scalia. They were on polar opposites, on the Supreme Court of the United States – one very liberal, one very conservative. But what’s been learned since her passing was the two of them and their families were the very closest of friends. Here in America, we can disagree, we can debate vigorously as Senator Harris and I have on this stage tonight. But when the debate is over, we come together as Americans. And that’s what people do in big cities and small towns all across this country, so I just want to encourage you, Brecklynn, I want to tell you that we’re going to work every day to have a government as good as our people, the American people, each and every day. We love a good debate. We love a good argument. But we always come together and are always there for one another in times of need. And we’ve especially learned that through the difficulties of this year."
PAGE," Thank you, Vice President. Senator Harris, what would you say to Brecklynn?"
HARRIS," First of all, I love hearing from our young leaders, and when I hear her words, when I hear your words, Brecklynn, I know our future is bright, because it is that perspective on who we are and who we should be – that is a sign of leadership and is something we should all aspire to be."
PAGE," Good evening. From the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, welcome to the first, and only, vice presidential debate of 2020, sponsored by the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates. I’m Susan Page of USA TODAY. It is my honor to moderate this debate, an important part of our democracy. In Kingsbury Hall tonight we have a small and socially distant audience and we’ve taken extra precautions during this pandemic. Among other things, everyone in the audience is required to wear a face mask and the candidates will be seated 12 feet apart. The audience is enthusiastic about their candidates, but they’ve agreed to express that enthusiasm, only twice. At the end of the debate and now when I introduce the candidates. Please welcome California Senator Kamala Harris and Vice President Mike Pence."
HOLT," Good evening from Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. I’m Lester Holt, anchor of “NBC Nightly News.” I want to welcome you to the first presidential debate."
CLINTON," How are you, Donald? [applause]"
HOLT, Good luck to you. [applause]
CLINTON," Well, thank you, Lester, and thanks to Hofstra for hosting us."
HOLT," Secretary Clinton, thank you."
TRUMP," Thank you, Lester. Our jobs are fleeing the country. They’re going to Mexico. They’re going to many other countries. You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product. They’re devaluing their currency, and there’s nobody in our government to fight them. And we have a very good fight. And we have a winning fight. Because they’re using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing."
HOLT," Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond?"
CLINTON," Well, I think that trade is an important issue. Of course, we are 5 percent of the world’s population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent. And we need to have smart, fair trade deals."
HOLT," Let me follow up with Mr. Trump, if I can. You’ve talked about creating 25 million jobs, and you’ve promised to bring back millions of jobs for Americans. How are you going to bring back the industries that have left this country for cheaper labor overseas? How, specifically, are you going to tell American manufacturers that you have to come back?"
TRUMP," Well, for one thing—and before we start on that—my father gave me a very small loan in 1975, and I built it into a company that’s worth many, many billions of dollars, with some of the greatest assets in the world, and I say that only because that’s the kind of thinking that our country needs."
HOLT," Let me interrupt just a moment, but…"
TRUMP," Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that we’ve created a movement. They should have been doing this for years. What’s happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is—look, we owe $20 trillion. We cannot do it any longer, Lester."
HOLT," Back to the question, though. How do you bring back—specifically bring back jobs, American manufacturers? How do you make them bring the jobs back?"
TRUMP," Well, the first thing you do is don’t let the jobs leave. The companies are leaving. I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them. They’re leaving, and they’re leaving in bigger numbers than ever."
HOLT, Let me let Secretary Clinton get in here.
CLINTON," Well, let’s stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago. We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s. That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm."
TRUMP," That’s called business, by the way."
CLINTON, Nine million people—nine million people lost their jobs. Five million people lost their homes. And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.
TRUMP, I did not. I did not. I do not say that.
CLINTON, I think science is real.
TRUMP, I do not say that.
CLINTON," And I think it’s important that we grip this and deal with it, both at home and abroad. And here’s what we can do. We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels. We can have enough clean energy to power every home. We can build a new modern electric grid. That’s a lot of jobs; that’s a lot of new economic activity."
HOLT, Mr. Trump?
TRUMP," She talks about solar panels. We invested in a solar company, our country. That was a disaster. They lost plenty of money on that one."
CLINTON," Well, actually…"
TRUMP, I will bring—excuse me. I will bring back jobs. You can’t bring back jobs.
CLINTON," Well, actually, I have thought about this quite a bit."
TRUMP," Yeah, for 30 years."
CLINTON," And I have—well, not quite that long. I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s. I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again…"
TRUMP," Well, he approved NAFTA…"
CLINTON," … million new jobs, a balanced budget…"
TRUMP," He approved NAFTA, which is the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country."
CLINTON," Incomes went up for everybody. Manufacturing jobs went up also in the 1990s, if we’re actually going to look at the facts."
HOLT, Very quickly…
TRUMP, But you haven’t done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want to…
CLINTON," Well, I’ve been a senator, Donald…"
TRUMP, You haven’t done it. You haven’t done it.
CLINTON, And I have been a secretary of state…
TRUMP, Excuse me.
CLINTON, And I have done a lot…
TRUMP," Your husband signed NAFTA, which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry."
CLINTON," Well, that’s your opinion. That is your opinion."
TRUMP," You go to New England, you go to Ohio, Pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, Secretary Clinton, and you will see devastation where manufacture is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent. NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country."
CLINTON," Well, that is just not accurate. I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out. I wrote about that in…"
TRUMP, You called it the gold standard.
TRUMP, You called it the gold standard of trade deals. You said it’s the finest deal you’ve ever seen.
CLINTON, No.
TRUMP," And then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it."
CLINTON," Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts. The facts are—I did say I hoped it would be a good deal, but when it was negotiated…"
TRUMP, Not.
CLINTON," … which I was not responsible for, I concluded it wasn’t. I wrote about that in my book…"
TRUMP, So is it President Obama’s fault?
CLINTON, … before you even announced.
TRUMP, Is it President Obama’s fault?
CLINTON," Look, there are differences…"
TRUMP," Secretary, is it President Obama’s fault?"
CLINTON, There are…
TRUMP, Because he’s pushing it.
CLINTON," There are different views about what’s good for our country, our economy, and our leadership in the world. And I think it’s important to look at what we need to do to get the economy going again. That’s why I said new jobs with rising incomes, investments, not in more tax cuts that would add $5 trillion to the debt."
TRUMP, But you have no plan.
CLINTON," But in—oh, but I do."
TRUMP," Secretary, you have no plan."
CLINTON," In fact, I have written a book about it. It’s called “Stronger Together.” You can pick it up tomorrow at a bookstore…"
TRUMP, That’s about all you’ve…
HOLT," Folks, we’re going to…"
CLINTON, … or at an airport near you.
HOLT, We’re going to move to…
CLINTON," But it’s because I see this—we need to have strong growth, fair growth, sustained growth. We also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business."
TRUMP," You are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history. You are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history. You are going to drive business out. Your regulations are a disaster, and you’re going to increase regulations all over the place."
HOLT," Let me get you to pause right there, because we’re going to move into—we’re going to move into the next segment. We’re going to talk taxes…"
CLINTON, That can’t—that can’t be left to stand.
HOLT, Please just take 30 seconds and then we’re going to go on.
CLINTON," I kind of assumed that there would be a lot of these charges and claims, and so…"
TRUMP, Facts.
CLINTON," So we have taken the home page of my website, HillaryClinton.com, and we’ve turned it into a fact-checker. So if you want to see in real-time what the facts are, please go and take a look. Because what I have proposed…"
TRUMP," And take a look at mine, also, and you’ll see."
CLINTON," … would not add a penny to the debt, and your plans would add $5 trillion to the debt. What I have proposed would cut regulations and streamline them for small businesses. What I have proposed would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy, because they have made all the gains in the economy. And I think it’s time that the wealthy and corporations paid their fair share to support this country."
HOLT," Well, you just opened the next segment."
TRUMP," Well, could I just finish—I think I…"
HOLT, I’m going to give you a chance right here…
TRUMP," I think I should—you go to her website, and you take a look at her website."
HOLT, … with a new 15-minute segment…
TRUMP, She’s going to raise taxes $1.3 trillion.
HOLT," Mr. Trump, I’m going to…"
TRUMP, And look at her website. You know what? It’s no difference than this. She’s telling us how to fight ISIS. Just go to her website. She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website. I don’t think General Douglas MacArthur would like that too much.
HOLT," The next segment, we’re continuing…"
CLINTON," Well, at least I have a plan to fight ISIS."
HOLT, … achieving prosperity…
TRUMP," No, no, you’re telling the enemy everything you want to do."
CLINTON," No, we’re not. No, we’re not."
TRUMP," See, you’re telling the enemy everything you want to do. No wonder you’ve been fighting—no wonder you’ve been fighting ISIS your entire adult life."
CLINTON," That’s a—that’s—go to the—please, fact checkers, get to work."
HOLT," OK, you are unpacking a lot here. And we’re still on the issue of achieving prosperity. And I want to talk about taxes. The fundamental difference between the two of you concerns the wealthy."
TRUMP," Well, I’m really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going to create tremendous jobs. They’re going to expand their companies. They’re going to do a tremendous job."
HOLT," All right. You have two minutes of the same question to defend tax increases on the wealthiest Americans, Secretary Clinton."
CLINTON," I have a feeling that by, the end of this evening, I’m going to be blamed for everything that’s ever happened."
TRUMP, Why not?
CLINTON," Why not? Yeah, why not? [laughter]"
TRUMP, There’s nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into their country.
HOLT," This is—this is Secretary Clinton’s two minutes, please."
TRUMP, Yes.
CLINTON," Yeah, well, let’s start the clock again, Lester. We’ve looked at your tax proposals. I don’t see changes in the corporate tax rates or the kinds of proposals you’re referring to that would cause the repatriation, bringing back of money that’s stranded overseas. I happen to support that."
TRUMP, Then you didn’t read it.
CLINTON," I happen to—I happen to support that in a way that will actually work to our benefit. But when I look at what you have proposed, you have what is called now the Trump loophole, because it would so advantage you and the business you do. You’ve proposed an approach that has a…"
TRUMP, Who gave it that name? The first I’ve—who gave it that name?
HOLT," Mr. Trump, this is Secretary Clinton’s two minutes."
CLINTON, … $4 billion tax benefit for your family. And when you look at what you are proposing…
TRUMP, How much? How much for my family?
CLINTON, … it is…
TRUMP," Lester, how much?"
CLINTON," … as I said, trumped-up trickle-down. Trickle-down did not work. It got us into the mess we were in, in 2008 and 2009. Slashing taxes on the wealthy hasn’t worked."
HOLT," Mr. Trump, we’re…"
TRUMP," Typical politician. All talk, no action. Sounds good, doesn’t work. Never going to happen. Our country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of what’s going on."
HOLT," Mr. Trump, we’re talking about the burden that Americans have to pay, yet you have not released your tax returns. And the reason nominees have released their returns for decades is so that voters will know if their potential president owes money to—who he owes it to and any business conflicts. Don’t Americans have a right to know if there are any conflicts of interest?"
TRUMP," I don’t mind releasing—I’m under a routine audit. And it’ll be released. And—as soon as the audit’s finished, it will be released."
HOLT, The IRS says an audit…
TRUMP, Excuse me.
HOLT," … of your taxes—you’re perfectly free to release your taxes during an audit. And so the question, does the public’s right to know outweigh your personal…"
TRUMP," Well, I told you, I will release them as soon as the audit. Look, I’ve been under audit almost for 15 years. I know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited. I said, do you get audited? I get audited almost every year."
HOLT, So it’s negotiable?
TRUMP," It’s not negotiable, no. Let her release the e-mails. Why did she delete 33,000…"
HOLT," Well, I’ll let her answer that. But let me just admonish the audience one more time. There was an agreement. We did ask you to be silent, so it would be helpful for us. Secretary Clinton?"
CLINTON," Well, I think you’ve just seen another example of bait-and- switch here. For 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns. You can go and see nearly, I think, 39, 40 years of our tax returns, but everyone has done it. We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when you’re under audit."
TRUMP, That makes me smart.
CLINTON," So if he’s paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health. And I think probably he’s not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are, because it must be something really important, even terrible, that he’s trying to hide."
HOLT, He also—he also raised the issue of your e-mails. Do you want to respond to that?
CLINTON," I do. You know, I made a mistake using a private e- mail."
TRUMP, That’s for sure.
CLINTON," And if I had to do it over again, I would, obviously, do it differently. But I’m not going to make any excuses. It was a mistake, and I take responsibility for that."
HOLT, Mr. Trump?
TRUMP," That was more than a mistake. That was done purposely. OK? That was not a mistake. That was done purposely. When you have your staff taking the Fifth Amendment, taking the Fifth so they’re not prosecuted, when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the Fifth, I think it’s disgraceful. And believe me, this country thinks it’s—really thinks it’s disgraceful, also."
HOLT, We’ll let you respond and we’ll move on to the next segment.
CLINTON, And maybe because you haven’t paid any federal income tax for a lot of years. [applause]
TRUMP," It would be squandered, too, believe me."
CLINTON," … is if your—if your main claim to be president of the United States is your business, then I think we should talk about that. You know, your campaign manager said that you built a lot of businesses on the backs of little guys."
TRUMP, Maybe he didn’t do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work…
CLINTON," Well, to…"
TRUMP," Which our country should do, too."
CLINTON," Do the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that they produced, and then refused to pay them?"
TRUMP, Wrong. Wrong.
CLINTON," Well, sometimes there’s not a direct transfer of skills from business to government, but sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for government."
HOLT, Let’s let Mr. Trump…
CLINTON, And we need to be very clear about that.
TRUMP," So, yeah, I think—I do think it’s time. Look, it’s all words, it’s all sound bites. I built an unbelievable company. Some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, real estate assets anywhere in the world, beyond the United States, in Europe, lots of different places. It’s an unbelievable company."
HOLT," Well, we’re well behind schedule, so I want to move to our next segment. We move into our next segment talking about America’s direction. And let’s start by talking about race."
CLINTON," Well, you’re right. Race remains a significant challenge in our country. Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how they’re treated in the criminal justice system. We’ve just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte."
HOLT," All right, Mr. Trump, you have two minutes. How do you heal the divide?"
TRUMP," Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesn’t want to use a couple of words, and that’s law and order. And we need law and order. If we don’t have it, we’re not going to have a country."
HOLT," Your two—your two minutes expired, but I do want to follow up. Stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York, because it largely singled out black and Hispanic young men."
TRUMP," No, you’re wrong. It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge. It was taken away from her. And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. They would have won an appeal. If you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where it’s allowed."
HOLT, The argument is that it’s a form of racial profiling.
TRUMP," No, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and that are bad people that shouldn’t have them."
HOLT, Secretary Clinton…
TRUMP," But we need—Lester, we need law and order. And we need law and order in the inner cities, because the people that are most affected by what’s happening are African-American and Hispanic people. And it’s very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen."
HOLT, Secretary Clinton?
CLINTON," Well, I’ve heard—I’ve heard Donald say this at his rallies, and it’s really unfortunate that he paints such a dire negative picture of black communities in our country."
TRUMP, Ugh.
CLINTON," You know, the vibrancy of the black church, the black businesses that employ so many people, the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids. There’s a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up."
HOLT," Secretary Clinton, last week, you said we’ve got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias. Do you believe that police are implicitly biased against black people?"
CLINTON," Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police. I think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other. And therefore, I think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am I feeling this way?"
HOLT, Mr. Trump…
TRUMP, I’d like to respond to that.
HOLT, Please.
TRUMP," First of all, I agree, and a lot of people even within my own party want to give certain rights to people on watch lists and no-fly lists. I agree with you. When a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I’m very proud of. These are very, very good people, and they’re protecting the Second Amendment."
CLINTON," Well, it’s also fair to say, if we’re going to talk about mayors, that under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders. So there is…"
TRUMP," No, you’re wrong. You’re wrong."
CLINTON," No, I’m not."
TRUMP, Murders are up. All right. You check it.
CLINTON," New York—New York has done an excellent job. And I give credit—I give credit across the board going back two mayors, two police chiefs, because it has worked. And other communities need to come together to do what will work, as well."
HOLT," This conversation is about race. And so, Mr. Trump, I have to ask you for five…"
TRUMP," I’d like to just respond, if I might."
HOLT, Please—20 seconds.
TRUMP, I’d just like to respond.
HOLT," Please respond, then I’ve got a quick follow-up for you."
TRUMP," I will. Look, the African-American community has been let down by our politicians. They talk good around election time, like right now, and after the election, they said, see ya later, I’ll see you in four years."
HOLT," Mr. Trump, let me…"
CLINTON," Well, I—I do think…"
TRUMP," And I will tell you, you look at the inner cities—and I just left Detroit, and I just left Philadelphia, and I just—you know, you’ve seen me, I’ve been all over the place. You decided to stay home, and that’s OK. But I will tell you, I’ve been all over. And I’ve met some of the greatest people I’ll ever meet within these communities. And they are very, very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done."
HOLT," Mr. Trump, I…"
CLINTON," I think—I think—I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. And, yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think that’s a good thing. [applause]"
HOLT," Mr. Trump, for five years, you perpetuated a false claim that the nation’s first black president was not a natural-born citizen. You questioned his legitimacy. In the last couple of weeks, you acknowledged what most Americans have accepted for years: The president was born in the United States. Can you tell us what took you so long?"
TRUMP," I’ll tell you very—well, just very simple to say. Sidney Blumenthal works for the campaign and close—very close friend of Secretary Clinton. And her campaign manager, Patti Doyle, went to—during the campaign, her campaign against President Obama, fought very hard. And you can go look it up, and you can check it out."
HOLT, That was…
TRUMP," Because I want to get on to defeating ISIS, because I want to get on to creating jobs, because I want to get on to having a strong border, because I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country."
HOLT," I will let you respond. It’s important. But I just want to get the answer here. The birth certificate was produced in 2011. You’ve continued to tell the story and question the president’s legitimacy in 2012, ’13, ’14, ’15…"
TRUMP, Yeah.
HOLT," …. as recently as January. So the question is, what changed your mind?"
TRUMP," Well, nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it. I figured you’d ask the question tonight, of course. But nobody was caring much about it. But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate. And I think I did a good job."
HOLT," I’m sorry. I’m just going to follow up—and I will let you respond to that, because there’s a lot there. But we’re talking about racial healing in this segment. What do you say to Americans, people of color who…"
TRUMP," Well, it was very—I say nothing. I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce it. He should have produced it a long time before. I say nothing."
HOLT, Secretary Clinton?
CLINTON," Well, just listen to what you heard. [laughter]"
HOLT," Mr. Trump, you can respond and we’re going to move on to the next segment."
TRUMP," I would love to respond. First of all, I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama. You treated him with terrible disrespect. And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are. It doesn’t work that way. You were after him, you were trying to—you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures. I don’t think you can deny that."
HOLT," Our next segment is called “Securing America.” We want to start with a 21st century war happening every day in this country. Our institutions are under cyber attack, and our secrets are being stolen. So my question is, who’s behind it? And how do we fight it?"
CLINTON," Well, I think cyber security, cyber warfare will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president, because clearly we’re facing at this point two different kinds of adversaries. There are the independent hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial reasons to try to steal information that they then can use to make money."
HOLT, Your two minutes have expired.
CLINTON, … have said that Donald is unfit to be the commander- in-chief. It’s comments like that that really worry people who understand the threats that we face.
HOLT," Mr. Trump, you have two minutes and the same question. Who’s behind it? And how do we fight it?"
TRUMP," I do want to say that I was just endorsed—and more are coming next week—it will be over 200 admirals, many of them here—admirals and generals endorsed me to lead this country. That just happened, and many more are coming. And I’m very proud of it."
HOLT, Secretary Clinton?
CLINTON," Well, I think there are a number of issues that we should be addressing. I have put forth a plan to defeat ISIS. It does involve going after them online. I think we need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the Internet to radicalize, even direct people in our country and Europe and elsewhere."
HOLT," You mention ISIS, and we think of ISIS certainly as over there, but there are American citizens who have been inspired to commit acts of terror on American soil, the latest incident, of course, the bombings we just saw in New York and New Jersey, the knife attack at a mall in Minnesota, in the last year, deadly attacks in San Bernardino and Orlando. I’ll ask this to both of you. Tell us specifically how you would prevent homegrown attacks by American citizens, Mr. Trump?"
TRUMP," Well, first I have to say one thing, very important. Secretary Clinton is talking about taking out ISIS. “We will take out ISIS.” Well, President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because they got out—what, they shouldn’t have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster. And ISIS was formed."
HOLT, Secretary Clinton?
CLINTON," Well, I hope the fact-checkers are turning up the volume and really working hard. Donald supported the invasion of Iraq."
TRUMP, Wrong.
CLINTON, That is absolutely proved over and over again.
TRUMP, Wrong. Wrong.
CLINTON," He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time."
HOLT, Mr. Trump…
TRUMP," Well, I have to respond."
HOLT, Please respond.
TRUMP," The secretary said very strongly about working with—we’ve been working with them for many years, and we have the greatest mess anyone’s ever seen. You look at the Middle East, it’s a total mess. Under your direction, to a large extent."
CLINTON," Lester, we’ve covered…"
TRUMP," No, wait a minute."
CLINTON, We’ve covered this ground.
TRUMP," When they formed, when they formed, this is something that never should have happened. It should have never happened. Now, you’re talking about taking out ISIS. But you were there, and you were secretary of state when it was a little infant. Now it’s in over 30 countries. And you’re going to stop them? I don’t think so."
HOLT," Mr. Trump, a lot of these are judgment questions. You had supported the war in Iraq before the invasion. What makes your…"
TRUMP, I did not support the war in Iraq.
HOLT, In 2002…
TRUMP," That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her, because she—frankly, I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media."
HOLT," My question is, since you supported it…"
TRUMP, Just—would you like to hear…
HOLT, … why is your—why is your judgment…
TRUMP, Wait a minute. I was against the war in Iraq. Just so you put it out.
HOLT," The record shows otherwise, but why—why was…"
TRUMP, The record does not show that.
HOLT, Why was—is your judgment any…
TRUMP," The record shows that I’m right. When I did an interview with Howard Stern, very lightly, first time anyone’s asked me that, I said, very lightly, I don’t know, maybe, who knows? Essentially. I then did an interview with Neil Cavuto. We talked about the economy is more important. I then spoke to Sean Hannity, which everybody refuses to call Sean Hannity. I had numerous conversations with Sean Hannity at Fox. And Sean Hannity said—and he called me the other day—and I spoke to him about it—he said you were totally against the war, because he was for the war."
HOLT, Why is your judgment better than…
TRUMP," And when he—excuse me. And that was before the war started. Sean Hannity said very strongly to me and other people—he’s willing to say it, but nobody wants to call him. I was against the war. He said, you used to have fights with me, because Sean was in favor of the war."
HOLT," My reference was to what you had said in 2002, and my question was…"
TRUMP," No, no. You didn’t hear what I said."
HOLT, Why is your judgment—why is your judgment any different than Mrs. Clinton’s judgment?
TRUMP," Well, I have much better judgment than she does. There’s no question about that. I also have a much better temperament than she has, you know? [laughter]"
HOLT, Secretary Clinton?
TRUMP," Wait. The AFL-CIO the other day, behind the blue screen, I don’t know who you were talking to, Secretary Clinton, but you were totally out of control. I said, there’s a person with a temperament that’s got a problem."
HOLT, Secretary Clinton?
CLINTON," Whew, OK. [laughter]"
TRUMP, That would not start a war.
CLINTON," That is not the right temperament to be commander-in-chief, to be taunted. And the worst part…"
TRUMP," No, they were taunting us."
CLINTON," … of what we heard Donald say has been about nuclear weapons. He has said repeatedly that he didn’t care if other nations got nuclear weapons, Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia. It has been the policy of the United States, Democrats and Republicans, to do everything we could to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons. He even said, well, you know, if there were nuclear war in East Asia, well, you know, that’s fine…"
TRUMP, Wrong.
CLINTON," … have a good time, folks."
TRUMP, It’s lies.
CLINTON," And, in fact, his cavalier attitude about nuclear weapons is so deeply troubling. That is the number-one threat we face in the world. And it becomes particularly threatening if terrorists ever get their hands on any nuclear material. So a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes, as far as I think anyone with any sense about this should be concerned."
TRUMP," That line’s getting a little bit old, I must say. I would like to…"
CLINTON," It’s a good one, though. It well describes the problem. [laughter]"
TRUMP," It’s not an accurate one at all. It’s not an accurate one. So I just want to give a lot of things—and just to respond. I agree with her on one thing. The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons, not global warming, like you think and your—your president thinks."
HOLT, We need to move on.
TRUMP," Well, wait, but it’s very important. All I said was, they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out. We’re a country that owes $20 trillion. They have to help us out."
HOLT, Our last…
TRUMP," As far as the nuclear is concerned, I agree. It is the single greatest threat that this country has."
HOLT," Which leads to my next question, as we enter our last segment here on the, still on the subject of securing America. On nuclear weapons, President Obama reportedly considered changing the nation’s longstanding policy on first use. Do you support the current policy? Mr. Trump, you have two minutes on that."
TRUMP," Well, I have to say that, you know, for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia, she’s very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries. But Russia has been expanding their—they have a much newer capability than we do. We have not been updating from the new standpoint."
HOLT, Your two minutes is expired.
TRUMP," And they’re going to end up getting nuclear. I met with Bibi Netanyahu the other day. Believe me, he’s not a happy camper."
HOLT," All right. Mrs. Clinton, Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes."
CLINTON," Well, let me—let me start by saying, words matter. Words matter when you run for president. And they really matter when you are president. And I want to reassure our allies in Japan and South Korea and elsewhere that we have mutual defense treaties and we will honor them."
HOLT, Your two minutes is…
CLINTON, … to be given any opportunities at all.
HOLT, … is expired.
TRUMP," Lester, one thing I’d like to say."
HOLT, Very quickly. Twenty seconds.
TRUMP," I will go very quickly. But I will tell you that Hillary will tell you to go to her website and read all about how to defeat ISIS, which she could have defeated by never having it, you know, get going in the first place. Right now, it’s getting tougher and tougher to defeat them, because they’re in more and more places, more and more states, more and more nations."
HOLT, Mr. Trump…
TRUMP," And it’s a big problem. And as far as Japan is concerned, I want to help all of our allies, but we are losing billions and billions of dollars. We cannot be the policemen of the world. We cannot protect countries all over the world…"
HOLT, We have just…
TRUMP, … where they’re not paying us what we need.
HOLT, We have just a few final questions…
TRUMP," And she doesn’t say that, because she’s got no business ability. We need heart. We need a lot of things. But you have to have some basic ability. And sadly, she doesn’t have that. All of the things that she’s talking about could have been taken care of during the last 10 years, let’s say, while she had great power. But they weren’t taken care of. And if she ever wins this race, they won’t be taken care of."
HOLT," Mr. Trump, this year Secretary Clinton became the first woman nominated for president by a major party. Earlier this month, you said she doesn’t have, quote, “a presidential look.” She’s standing here right now. What did you mean by that?"
TRUMP," She doesn’t have the look. She doesn’t have the stamina. I said she doesn’t have the stamina. And I don’t believe she does have the stamina. To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina."
HOLT," The quote was, “I just don’t think she has the presidential look.”"
TRUMP," You have—wait a minute. Wait a minute, Lester. You asked me a question. Did you ask me a question?"
HOLT, Let’s let her respond.
CLINTON," Well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina. [applause]"
TRUMP," The world—let me tell you. Let me tell you. Hillary has experience, but it’s bad experience. We have made so many bad deals during the last—so she’s got experience, that I agree. [applause]"
HOLT, We are at—we are at the final question. [applause]
CLINTON," Well, one thing. One thing, Lester."
HOLT," Very quickly, because we’re at the final question now."
CLINTON," You know, he tried to switch from looks to stamina. But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs, and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers, who has said…"
TRUMP, I never said that.
CLINTON, …. women don’t deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.
TRUMP, I didn’t say that.
CLINTON," And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest. He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them. And he called this woman “Miss Piggy.” Then he called her “Miss Housekeeping,” because she was Latina. Donald, she has a name."
TRUMP, Where did you find this? Where did you find this?
CLINTON, Her name is Alicia Machado.
TRUMP, Where did you find this?
CLINTON," And she has become a U.S. citizen, and you can bet…"
TRUMP," Oh, really?"
CLINTON, … she’s going to vote this November.
TRUMP," OK, good. Let me just tell you… [applause]"
HOLT," Mr. Trump, could we just take 10 seconds and then we ask the final question…"
TRUMP," You know, Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials. Some of it’s said in entertainment. Some of it’s said—somebody who’s been very vicious to me, Rosie O’Donnell, I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her."
HOLT, Please very quickly.
TRUMP," … extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, “I can’t do it. I just can’t do it. It’s inappropriate. It’s not nice.” But she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me, many of which are absolutely untrue. They’re untrue. And they’re misrepresentations."
HOLT, We have to move on to the final question.
TRUMP," … $200 million is spent, and I’m either winning or tied, and I’ve spent practically nothing. [applause]"
HOLT," One of you will not win this election. So my final question to you tonight, are you willing to accept the outcome as the will of the voters? Secretary Clinton?"
CLINTON," Well, I support our democracy. And sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. But I certainly will support the outcome of this election."
HOLT," Mr. Trump, very quickly, same question. Will you accept the outcome as the will of the voters?"
TRUMP, I want to make America great again. We are a nation that is seriously troubled. We’re losing our jobs. People are pouring into our country.
HOLT, Will you accept the outcome of the election?
TRUMP," Look, here’s the story. I want to make America great again. I’m going to be able to do it. I don’t believe Hillary will. The answer is, if she wins, I will absolutely support her. [applause]"
HOLT," All right. Well, that is going to do it for us. That concludes our debate for this evening, a spirited one. We covered a lot of ground, not everything as I suspected we would."
HOLT," Good evening from Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. I’m Lester Holt, anchor of “NBC Nightly News.” I want to welcome you to the first presidential debate."
WALLACE," Good evening from the Health Education Campus of Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic. I’m Chris Wallace of Fox News and I welcome you to the first of the 2020 presidential debates between President Donald J. Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. The Commission has designed the format, six roughly 15-minute segments with two-minute answers from each candidate to the first question, then open discussion for the rest of each segment. Both campaigns have agreed to these rules. For the record, I decided the topics and the questions in each topic. I can assure you none of the questions has been shared with the Commission or the two candidates."
BIDEN," How you doing, man?"
TRUMP, How are you doing?
BIDEN, I’m well.
WALLACE," Gentlemen, a lot of people have been waiting for this night, so let’s get going. Our first subject is the Supreme Court. President Trump, you nominated Amy Coney Barrett over the weekend to succeed the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Court. You say the Constitution is clear about your obligation and the Senate’s to consider a nominee to the Court. Vice President Biden, you say that this is an effort by the President and Republicans to jam through on an appointment in what you call an abuse of power. My first question to both of you tonight, why are you right in the argument you make and your opponent wrong? And where do you think a Justice Barrett would take the court? President Trump, in this first segment, you go first. Two minutes."
TRUMP," Thank you very much, Chris. I will tell you very simply. We won the election. Elections have consequences. We have the Senate, we have the White House, and we have a phenomenal nominee respected by all. Top, top academic, good in every way. Good in every way. In fact, some of her biggest endorsers are very liberal people from Notre Dame and other places. So I think she’s going to be fantastic. We have plenty of time. Even if we did it after the election itself. I have a lot of time after the election, as you know. So I think that she will be outstanding. She’s going to be as good as anybody that has served on that court. We really feel that. We have a professor at Notre Dame, highly respected by all, said she’s the single greatest student he’s ever had. He’s been a professor for a long time at a great school."
WALLACE," President Trump, thank you. Same question to you, Vice President Biden. You have two minutes."
BIDEN," Well, first of all, thank you for doing this and looking forward to this, Mr. President."
TRUMP," Thank you, Joe."
BIDEN, The American people have a right to have a say in who the Supreme Court nominee is and that say occurs when they vote for United States Senators and when they vote for the President of United States. They’re not going to get that chance now because we’re in the middle of an election already. The election has already started. Tens of thousands of people already voted and so the thing that should happen is we should wait. We should wait and see what the outcome of this election is because that’s the only way the American people get to express their view is by who they elect as President and who they elect as Vice President.
TRUMP," There aren’t a hundred million people with pre-existing conditions. As far as a say is concerned, the people already had their say. Okay, Justice Ginsburg said very powerfully, very strongly, at some point 10 years ago or so, she said a President and the Senate is elected for a period of time, but a President is elected for four years. We’re not elected for three years. I’m not elected for three years. So we have the Senate, we have a President-"
BIDEN, He’s elected to the next election.
TRUMP," During that period of time, during that period of time, we have an opening. I’m not elected for three years. I’m elected for four years. Joe, the hundred million people is totally wrong. I don’t know where you got that number. The bigger problem that you have is that you’re going to extinguish 180 million people with their private health care, that they’re very happy with."
BIDEN, That’s simply not true.
TRUMP," Well, you’re certainly going to socialist. You’re going to socialist medicine-"
WALLACE," Gentlemen, we’re now into open discussion."
BIDEN, Open discussion.
WALLACE," Open discussion, yes, I agree. Go ahead, Vice President."
BIDEN," Number one, he knows what I proposed. What I proposed is that we expand Obamacare and we increase it. We do not wipe any. And one of the big debates we had with 23 of my colleagues trying to win the nomination that I won, were saying that Biden wanted to allow people to have private insurance still. They can. They do. They will under my proposal."
TRUMP, That’s not what you’ve said and it’s not what your party is saying.
BIDEN, That is simply a lie.
TRUMP, Your party doesn’t say it. Your party wants to go socialist medicine and socialist healthcare.
BIDEN," The party is me. Right now, I am the Democratic Party."
TRUMP," And they’re going to dominate you, Joe. You know that."
BIDEN, I am the Democratic Party right now.
TRUMP, Not according to Harris.
BIDEN," The platform of the Democratic Party is what I, in fact, approved of, what I approved of. Now, here’s the deal. The deal is that it’s going to wipe out pre-existing conditions. And, by the way, the 200,000 people that have died on his watch, how many of those have survived? Well, there’s seven million people that contracted COVID. What does it mean for them going forward if you strike down the Affordable Care Act?"
TRUMP," Joe, you’ve had 308,000 military people dying because you couldn’t provide them proper healthcare in the military. So don’t tell me about this."
BIDEN, I’m happy to talk about this.
TRUMP," And if you were here, it wouldn’t be 200, it would be two million people because you were very late on the draw. You didn’t want me to ban China, which was heavily infected. You didn’t want me to ban Europe."
WALLACE," All right, gentlemen, Mr. President."
TRUMP," You would have been much later, Joe, much later."
WALLACE, Mr. President.
TRUMP, We’re talking about two million people.
BIDEN, You’re not going to be able to shut him up.
WALLACE," Mr. President, as the moderator, we are going to talk about COVID in the next segment. But go ahead."
BIDEN," Let me finish. The point is that the President also is opposed to Roe V. Wade. That’s on the ballot as well and the court, in the court, and so that’s also at stake right now. And so the election is all-"
TRUMP, You don’t know what’s on the ballot. Why is it on the ballot? Why is it on the ballot? It’s not on the ballot.
BIDEN, It’s on the ballot in the court.
TRUMP, I don’t think so.
BIDEN, In the court.
TRUMP, There’s nothing happening there.
BIDEN, Donald would you just be quiet for a minute.
TRUMP, You don’t know her view on Roe V. Wade? You don’t know her view.
WALLACE," Well, all right. All right. Let’s talk. We’ve got a lot to unpack here, gentlemen. We’ve got a lot of time. On healthcare, and then we’ll come back to Roe V. Wade."
BIDEN, All right.
WALLACE," Mr. President, the Supreme Court will hear a case a week after the election in which the Trump Administration, along with 18 state Attorney Generals are seeking to overturn Obamacare, to end Obamacare."
TRUMP, That’s right.
WALLACE, You have spent the last week-
TRUMP, Because they want to give good healthcare.
WALLACE," If I may ask my question, sir."
BIDEN, Good healthcare.
WALLACE," Over the last four years, you have promised to repeal and replace Obamacare, but you have never in these four years come up with a plan, a comprehensive plan, to replace Obamacare."
TRUMP," Yes, I have. Of course, I have. The individual mandate."
WALLACE, [crosstalk] when I finish I’m going to give an opportunity-
TRUMP," Excuse me. I got rid of the individual mandate, which was a big chunk of Obamacare."
WALLACE, That’s not a comprehensive place.
TRUMP, That is absolutely a big thing. That was the worst part of Obamacare.
WALLACE," I didn’t ask, sir."
TRUMP," Chris, that was the worst part of Obamacare."
WALLACE, You’re debating him not me. Let me ask my question.
TRUMP," Well, I’ll ask Joe. The individual mandate was the most unpopular aspect of Obamacare."
WALLACE, Mr. President.
TRUMP, I got rid of it. And we will protect people.
WALLACE," Mr. President, I’m the moderator of this debate and I would like you to let me ask my question and then you can answer."
TRUMP, Go ahead.
WALLACE," You, in the course of these four years, have never come up with a comprehensive plan to replace Obamacare, and just this last Thursday you signed a largely symbolic Executive Order to protect people with pre-existing conditions five days before this debate. So my question, sir, is what is the Trump healthcare plan?"
TRUMP," Well, first of all, I guess I’m debating you, not him, but that’s okay. I’m not surprised. Let me just tell you something. There’s nothing symbolic. I’m cutting drug prices. I’m going with Favored Nations, which no President has the courage to do because you’re going against big pharma. Drug prices will be coming down 80 or 90%. You could have done it during your 47-year period in government, but you didn’t do it. Nobody’s done it. So we’re cutting healthcare."
WALLACE, What about pre-existing conditions?
TRUMP, All of the things that we’ve done.
BIDEN, He has not done healthcare.
TRUMP," I’ll give you an example. Insulin, it was destroying families, destroying people, the cost. I’m getting it for so cheap it’s like water, you want to know the truth. So cheap. Take a look at all of the drugs that what we’re doing. Prescription drug prices, we’re going to allow our Governors now to go to other countries to buy drugs because when they paid just a tiny fraction of what we do."
WALLACE," Okay, like I say, this is open discussion."
TRUMP, This is big stuff.
WALLACE," Sir, you’ll be happy. I’m about to pick up on one of your points to ask the Vice President, which is, he points out that you would like to add a public option to Obamacare."
BIDEN, Yes.
WALLACE, And the argument that he makes and other Republicans make is that that is going to end private insurance.
BIDEN, It is not.
WALLACE, If I start asking the question.
TRUMP," That’s not what your party says, by the way."
WALLACE, And it will end private insurance and create a government takeover of healthcare.
BIDEN," It does not. It’s only for those people who are so poor they qualify for Medicaid they can get that free in most States, except Governors who want to deny people who are poor Medicaid. Anyone who qualifies for Medicaid would automatically be enrolled in the public option. The vast majority of the American people would still not be in that option. Number one. Number two."
TRUMP," Joe, you agreed with Bernie Sanders, who’s far left, on the manifesto, we call it. And that gives you socialized medicine."
BIDEN," Look, hey."
TRUMP, Are you saying you didn’t agree?
BIDEN, I’m not going to listen to him. The fact of the matter is I beat Bernie Sanders.
TRUMP, Not by much.
BIDEN, I beat him by a whole hell of a lot.
TRUMP, Not by much.
BIDEN," I’m here standing facing you, old buddy."
TRUMP, If Pocahontas would have left two days early you would have lost every primary.
BIDEN, All he knows how to do-
TRUMP," On Super Tuesday, you got very lucky."
BIDEN, Look he’s the deal. I got very lucky. I’m going to get very lucky tonight as well.
TRUMP, With what?
BIDEN, And tonight I’m going to make sure.
TRUMP, With what?
BIDEN," Because here’s the deal, here’s the deal. The fact is that everything he’s saying so far is simply a lie. I’m not here to call out his lies. Everybody knows he’s a liar."
TRUMP," But you agree. Joe, you’re the liar. You graduated last in your class not first in your class."
BIDEN," God, I want to make sure-"
WALLACE," Mr. President, can you let him finish, sir?"
BIDEN," No, he doesn’t know how to do that."
TRUMP," You’d be surprised. You’d be surprised. Go ahead, Joe."
BIDEN," The wrong guy, the wrong night, at the wrong time."
TRUMP," Listen, you agreed with Bernie Sanders and the manifesto."
BIDEN," There is no manifesto, number one."
WALLACE," Please let him speak, Mr. President."
BIDEN, Number two.
TRUMP, He just lost the left.
BIDEN, Number two.
TRUMP," You just lost the left. You agreed with Bernie Sanders on a plan that you absolutely agreed to and under that plan [crosstalk], they call it socialized medicine."
WALLACE, Mr. President.
BIDEN," I’ll tell you what, he is not for any help for people needing healthcare."
TRUMP," Who is, Bernie?"
BIDEN," Because he, in fact, already has cost 10 million people their healthcare that they had from their employers because of his recession. Number one. Number two, there are 20 million people getting healthcare through Obamacare now that he wants to take it away. He won’t ever look you in the eye and say that’s what he wants to do. Take it away."
TRUMP," No, I want to give them better healthcare at a much lower price, because Obamacare is no good."
BIDEN, He doesn’t know how. He doesn’t know how to do that.
TRUMP, I’ve already fixed it.
BIDEN, He has never offered a plan.
TRUMP," We’ve already fixed it to an extent. Obamacare, as you might know but probably don’t, Obamacare is no good."
WALLACE," Gentlemen, you realize if you’re both speaking at the same time. Let the President. Go ahead, sir."
TRUMP," Obamacare is no good. We made it better and I had a choice to make very early on. We took away the individual mandate. We guaranteed pre-existing conditions, but took away the individual mandate. Listen, this is the way it is. And that destroyed … They shouldn’t even call it Obamacare, then I had a choice to make, do I let my people run it really well or badly? If I run it badly, they’ll probably blame him, but they’ll blame me. But more importantly, I want to help people. Okay. I said, “You’ve got to run it so well.” And I just had a meeting with them. They said the problem is, no matter how well you run Obamacare, it’s a disaster. It’s too expensive. Premiums are too high, that it doesn’t work. So we do want to get rid of it. Chris, we want to get rid of that and give something that’s cheaper and better."
WALLACE," I understand that, sir. But I have to give you roughly equal time."
TRUMP, Go ahead.
WALLACE," Please let the Vice President talk, sir."
TRUMP, Good.
BIDEN, He has no plan for healthcare.
TRUMP," Of course, we do."
WALLACE, Please.
BIDEN," He sends out wishful thinking. He has Executive Orders that have no power. He hasn’t lowered drug costs for anybody. He’s been promising a healthcare plan since he got elected. He has none, like almost everything else he talks about. He does not have a plan. He doesn’t have a plan. And the fact is this man doesn’t know what he’s talking about. "
WALLACE," All right, I have one final question for you."
BIDEN, Sure.
WALLACE," Mr. Vice President, if Senate Republicans, we were talking originally about the Supreme Court here, if Senate Republicans go ahead and confirm Justice Barrett there has been talk about ending the filibuster or even packing the court, adding to the nine justices there. You call this a distraction by the President. But, in fact, it wasn’t brought up by the President. It was brought up by some of your Democratic colleagues in the Congress. So my question to you is, you have refused in the past to talk about it, are you willing to tell the American people tonight whether or not you will support either ending the filibuster or packing the court?"
BIDEN," Whatever position I take on that, that’ll become the issue. The issue is the American people should speak. You should go out and vote. You’re voting now. Vote and let your Senators know how strongly you feel."
TRUMP, Are you going to pack the court?
BIDEN, Vote now.
TRUMP, Are you going to pack the court?
BIDEN," Make sure you, in fact, let people know, your Senators."
TRUMP, He doesn’t want to answer the question.
BIDEN, I’m not going to answer the question.
TRUMP, Why wouldn’t you answer that question? You want to put a lot of new Supreme Court Justices. Radical left.
BIDEN," Will you shut up, man?"
TRUMP," Listen, who is on your list, Joe? Who’s on your list?"
WALLACE," Gentlemen, I think we’ve ended this-"
BIDEN, This is so un-Presidential.
TRUMP, He’s going to pack the court. He is not going to give a list.
WALLACE, We have ended the segment. We’re going to move on to the second segment.
BIDEN," That was really a productive segment, wasn’t it? Keep yapping, man."
TRUMP," The people understand, Joe."
BIDEN, They sure do.
TRUMP," 47 years, you’ve done nothing. They understand."
WALLACE," All right, the second subject is COVID-19, which is an awfully serious subject. So let’s try to be serious about it. We have had more than seven million cases of coronavirus in the United States and more than 200,000 people have died. Even after we produce a vaccine, experts say that it could be months or even years before we come back to anything approaching normal. My question for both of you is, based on what you have said and done so far, and what you have said you would do starting in 2021, why should the American people trust you more than your opponent to deal with this public health crisis going forward? In this case, the question goes to you first, sir. Two minutes, uninterrupted."
BIDEN," Good luck. 200,000 dead. As you said, over seven million infected in the United States. We, in fact, have 4% of the world’s population, 20% of the deaths. 40,000 people a day are contracting COVID. In addition to that, about between 750 and 1000 people a day are dying. When he was presented with that number, he said, “It is what it is.” Well, it is what it is because you are who you are. That’s why it is. The President has no plan. He hasn’t laid out anything. He knew all the way back in February how serious this crisis was. He knew it was a deadly disease. What did he do? He’s on tape as acknowledging he knew it. He said he didn’t tell us or give people a warning of it because he didn’t want to panic the American people. You don’t panic. He panicked. In addition to that, what did he do?"
BIDEN, He went in and we were insisting that the people we had in the ground in China should be able to go to Wuhan and determine for themselves how dangerous this was. He did not even ask Xi to do that.
TRUMP, Wrong.
BIDEN, He told us what a great job Xi was doing. He said we owe him a debt of gratitude for being so transparent with us. And what did he do then? He then did nothing. He waited and waited and waited. He still doesn’t have a plan.
TRUMP, Wrong.
WALLACE," Sir, it’s his two minutes."
TRUMP, It’s so wrong.
BIDEN," I laid out back in March, exactly what we should be doing. And I laid out again in July, what we should be doing. We should be providing all the protective gear possible. We should be providing the money the House has passed in order to be able to go out and get people the help they need to keep their businesses open. Open schools cost a lot of money. You should get out of your bunker and get out of the sand trap in your golf course and go in the Oval Office and bring together the Democrats and Republicans and fund what needs to be done now to save lives."
TRUMP," So, if we would have listened to you."
WALLACE," Wait, wait. You have two minutes, sir."
TRUMP," If we would’ve listened to you, the country would have been left wide open, millions of people would have died, not 200,000. And one person is too much. It’s China’s fault. It should have never happened. They stopped it from going in, but it was China’s fault. And, by the way, when you talk about numbers, you don’t know how many people died in China. You don’t know how many people died in Russia. You don’t know how many people died in India. They don’t exactly give you a straight count, just so you understand. But if you look at what we’ve done, I closed it and you said, “He’s xenophobic. He’s a racist and he’s xenophobic,” because you didn’t think I should have closed our country. Wait a minute."
WALLACE," Sir, it’s his two minutes."
TRUMP," You didn’t think we should have closed our country because you thought it was terrible. You wouldn’t have closed it for another two months. By my doing it early, in fact, Dr. Fauci said, “President Trump saved thousands of lives.” Many of your Democrat Governors said, “President Trump did a phenomenal job.” We worked with the Governor. Oh really, go take a look. The Governors said I did a phenomenal job. Most of them said that. In fact, people that would not be necessarily on my side said that, “President Trump did a phenomenal job.” We did. We got the gowns. We got the masks. We made the ventilators. You wouldn’t have made ventilators. And now we’re weeks away from a vaccine. We’re doing therapeutics already. Fewer people are dying when they get sick. Far fewer people are dying. We’ve done a great job."
TRUMP," The only thing I haven’t done a good job, and that’s because of the fake news, no matter what you say to them, they give you a bad press on it. It’s just fake news. They give you good press, they give me bad press because that’s the way it is, unfortunately. But let me just say something. I don’t care. I’ve gotten used to it. But I’ll tell you, Joe, you could never have done the job that we did. You don’t have it in your blood. You could’ve never done that, Joe."
BIDEN, I know how to do the job. I know how to get the job done.
TRUMP," Well, you didn’t do very well in Swine Flu. H1-N1, you were a disaster. Your own Chief of Staff said you were a disaster."
BIDEN," 14,000 people died, not 200,000."
TRUMP," A far less lethal disease, by the way."
WALLACE," Sir, you made a point. Let him answer it."
BIDEN," And there was no one … We didn’t shut down the economy. This is his economy he shut down. The reason it’s shut down is because, look, you folks at home. How many of you got up this morning and had an empty chair at the kitchen table because someone died of COVID? How many of you are in a situation where you lost your mom or dad and you couldn’t even speak to them, you had a nurse holding a phone up so you could in fact say goodbye?"
TRUMP," We would have lost far more people, far more people. You would have been months late. You’re months behind me, Joe."
BIDEN," His own CDC Director says we could lose as many as another 200,000 people between now and the end of the year. And he said, if we just wear a mask, we can save half those numbers. Just a mask. And by the way, in terms of the whole notion of a vaccine, we’re for a vaccine, but I don’t trust him at all. Nor do you. I know you don’t. What we trust is a scientist."
TRUMP," You don’t trust Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer?"
WALLACE," Okay, gentlemen, gentlemen. Let me move on to questions about the future because you both have touched on two of the questions I’m going to ask. Focusing on the future first, President Trump, you have repeatedly either contradicted or been at odds with some of your governments own top scientists. The week before last, the Head of the Centers for Disease Control, Dr. Redfield said it would be summer before the vaccine would become generally available to the public. You said that he was confused and mistaken. Those were your two words. But Dr. Slaoui, the head of your Operation Warp Speed, has said exactly the same thing. Are they both wrong?"
TRUMP," Well, I’ve spoken to the companies and we can have it a lot sooner. It’s a very political thing because people like this would rather make it political than save lives."
BIDEN, God.
TRUMP," It is a very political thing. I’ve spoken to Pfizer, I’ve spoken to all of the people that you have to speak to, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and others. They can go faster than that by a lot. It’s become very political because the left… Or I don’t know if I call them left, I don’t know what I call them."
WALLACE," So you’re suggesting that the head of your Operation Warp Speed, Dr. Slaoui-"
TRUMP," I disagree with him. No, I disagree with both of them. And he didn’t say that. He said it could be there, but it could also be much sooner. I had him in my office two days ago."
WALLACE," He talked about the summer, sir, before it’s generally available, just like Dr. Redfield."
TRUMP, Because he said it’s a possibility that we’ll have the answer before November 1st. It could also be after that.
WALLACE," I’m talking about when it’s generally available, not-"
TRUMP," Well, we’re going to deliver it right away. We have the military all set up. Logistically, they’re all set up. We have our military that delivers soldiers and they can do 200,000 a day. They’re going to be delivering-"
BIDEN, This is the same man who told you-
TRUMP, It’s all set up.
BIDEN," … by Easter, this would be gone away. By the warm weather, it’d be gone. Miraculous, like a miracle. And by the way, maybe you could inject some bleach in your arm, and that would take care of it. This is the same man."
TRUMP," That was said sarcastically, and you know that. That was said sarcastically."
BIDEN," So here’s the deal. This man is talking about a vaccine. Every serious company is talking about maybe having a vaccine done by the end of the year, but the distribution of that vaccine will not occur until sometime beginning of the middle of next year to get it out, if we get the vaccine. And pray God we will. Pray God we will."
WALLACE," Mr. Vice President, I want to pick up-"
TRUMP, You’ll have the vaccine sooner than that.
WALLACE," I want to pick up on this question though. You say the public can trust the scientists, but they can’t trust President Trump. In fact, you said that again tonight. Your running mate, Senator Harris, goes further, saying that public health experts quote, “Will be muzzled, will be suppressed.” Given the fact that polls already show that people are concerned about the vaccine and are reluctant to take it, are you and your running mate, Senator Harris, contributing to that fear?"
BIDEN, No more than the question you just asked him. You pointed out he puts pressure and disagrees with his own scientists.
WALLACE, But you’re saying you can’t-
BIDEN, Everybody knows-
WALLACE, Or Senator Harris is saying you can’t trust the scientist.
BIDEN," Well, no, no. You can trust the scientist. She didn’t say that. You can trust the-"
WALLACE," She said that public health experts quote, “Will be muzzled, will be suppressed.”"
BIDEN," Yes. Well, that’s what he’s going to try to do, but there’s thousands of scientists out there, like here at this great hospital that don’t work for him. Their job doesn’t depend on him. They’re the people… And by the way-"
TRUMP, We spoke to the scientists that are in charge-
BIDEN, By the way-
TRUMP, … they will have the vaccine very soon.
WALLACE, Let him finish.
BIDEN," Do you believe for a moment what he’s telling you in light of all the lies he’s told you about the whole issue relating to COVID? He still hasn’t even acknowledged that he knew this was happening, knew how dangerous it was going to be back in February, and he didn’t even tell you. He’s on record as saying it. He panicked or he just looked at the stock market. One of the two. Because guess what? A lot of people died and a lot more are going to die unless he gets a lot smarter, a lot quicker-"
WALLACE, Mr. President?
TRUMP," Did you use the word smart? So you said you went to Delaware State, but you forgot the name of your college. You didn’t go to Delaware State. You graduated either the lowest or almost the lowest in your class. Don’t ever use the word smart with me. Don’t ever use that word."
BIDEN," Oh, give me a break."
TRUMP," Because you know what? There’s nothing smart about you, Joe. 47 years you’ve done nothing."
BIDEN," Well, let’s have this debate-"
TRUMP," Let me just tell you something, Joe. If you would have had the charge of what I was put through, I had to close the greatest economy in the history of our country. And by the way, now it’s being built again and it’s going up fast."
WALLACE," We’ll get to the economy in the next segment, sir."
TRUMP, It’s going up fast. I look forward to talking about it.
WALLACE," Okay. When it comes to how the virus has been handled so far, the two of you have taken very different approaches, and this is going to affect how the virus is handled going forward by whichever of you ends up becoming the next president. I want to quickly go through several of those. Reopenings. Vice President Biden, you have been much more reluctant than President Trump about reopening the economy and schools. Why, sir?"
BIDEN," Because he doesn’t have a plan. If I were running it, I’d know what the plan is. You’ve got to provide these businesses the ability to have the money to be able to reopen with the PPE, as well as with the sanitation they need. You have to provide them classic-"
TRUMP, Tell that to Nancy Pelosi.
BIDEN, Will he just shush for a minute?
TRUMP," Tell that to Nancy Pelosi, and Schumer [crosstalk] Chuck."
BIDEN," Nancy Pelosi and Schumer, they have a plan. He won’t even meet with them. The Republicans won’t meet in the Senate. He sits in his golf course. Well, I mean, literally, think about it. Think about it."
TRUMP," You probably play more than I do, Joe."
WALLACE, What about this question of reopenings and the fact-
TRUMP," Well, he wants to shut down this country and I want to keep it open, and we did a great thing by shutting it down-"
BIDEN, You just admitted you’d shut it down.
TRUMP," Wait a minute, Joe. Let me shut you down for a second, Joe, just for one second. He wants to shut down the country. We just went through it. We had to, because we didn’t know anything about the disease. Now we’ve found that elderly people with heart problems and diabetes and different problems are very, very vulnerable. We learned a lot. Young children aren’t, even younger people aren’t. We’ve learned a lot, but he wants to shut it down. More people will be hurt by continuing. If you look at Pennsylvania, if you look at certain states that have been shut down, they have Democrat governors, all, one of the reasons they shut down is because they want to keep it shut down until after the election on November 3rd."
WALLACE, All right. I want to move onto another-
TRUMP, Because it’s a political thing.
WALLACE, I want to move onto another subject.
BIDEN, I got to respond to that.
WALLACE, I want to move-
TRUMP, But those states-
WALLACE," Gentlemen, I want to move onto another subject."
TRUMP, Those states are not doing well that are shut down right now.
BIDEN, I got to respond to that.
TRUMP, He wants to shut down the whole country.
WALLACE," President Trump, you have begun to increasingly question the effectiveness of masks as a disease preventer. And in fact, recently you have cited the issue of waiters touching their masks and touching plates. Are you questioning the efficacy of masks?"
TRUMP," No, I think masks are okay. You have to understand, if you look… I mean, I have a mask right here. I put a mask on when I think I need it. Tonight, as an example, everybody’s had a test and you’ve had social distancing and all of the things that you have to, but I wear masks-"
BIDEN, Just like your rally.
TRUMP," … when needed. When needed, I wear masks."
WALLACE, Okay. Let me ask-
TRUMP," I don’t wear a mask like him. Every time you see him, he’s got a mask. He could be speaking 200 feet away from him and he shows up with the biggest mask I’ve ever seen. I will say this-"
WALLACE," Vice President Biden, go ahead, sir."
BIDEN," Look, the way to open businesses is give them the wherewithal to be able to open. We provided money, the-"
WALLACE," But I was asking you, sir, about masks."
BIDEN," Well, masks make a big difference. His own head of the CDC said if we just wore masks between now, if everybody wore a mask and social distanced between now and January, we’d probably save up to 100,000 lives. It matters. It matters."
TRUMP, And they’ve also said the opposite. They’ve also said-
BIDEN, No serious person has said the opposite. No serious person.
WALLACE, Okay. I want to ask you-
TRUMP, Dr. Fauci. Dr. Fauci said the opposite.
BIDEN, He did not say the opposite.
WALLACE," I want to ask you, we’ve got a little more than a minute left in this segment."
TRUMP," He said very strongly, “Masks are not good.” Then he changed his mind. He said, “Masks are good.”"
WALLACE, I want to ask-
TRUMP, I’m okay with masks. I’m not fighting masks.
WALLACE," I want to ask you both about one last subject because your different approaches has even affected the way that you have campaigned. President Trump, you’re holding large rallies with crowds packed together, thousands of people."
TRUMP, Outside.
WALLACE," Outside. Yes, sir. Agreed. Vice President Biden, you are holding much smaller events with-"
TRUMP, Because nobody will show up.
WALLACE, … people with masks.
TRUMP," Well, it’s true. Nobody shows up to his rallies."
WALLACE," All right. In any case, why you holding the big rallies? Why you not? You go first, sir."
TRUMP, Because people want to hear what I have to say. I mean-
WALLACE, But are not worried about us spreading disease?
TRUMP," … I’ve done a great job as a president, and I’ll have 25, 35,000 people show up at airports. We use airports and hangers and we have a lot of people-"
WALLACE," Are you not worried about the disease issues, sir?"
TRUMP," Well, so far we have had no problem whatsoever. It’s outside. That’s a big difference according to the experts. We do them outside, we have tremendous crowds, as you see, and literally on 24 hours notice. And Joe does the circles and has three people someplace."
BIDEN," By the way, did you see one of the last big rallies he had? A reporter came up to him to ask him a question, he said, “No, no, no. Stand back, put on your mask, put on a mask. Have you been tested? I’m way far away from those other people.” That’s what he said, “I’m going to be okay.” He’s not worried about you. He’s not worried about the people out there [crosstalk]."
TRUMP, We’ve had no negative effect.
BIDEN, No negative effect. Come on.
TRUMP," We’ve had no negative effect, and we’ve had 35, 40,000 people at these rallies."
WALLACE, All right. Do you want to just quickly finish up? Because I want to move on to our next-
BIDEN," Yes, I would. He’s been totally irresponsible the way in which he has handled the social distancing and people wearing masks, basically encouraged them not to. He’s a fool on this."
TRUMP," If you could get the crowds, you would have done the same thing. But you can’t. Nobody cares."
WALLACE," Gentlemen, can we move on to the-"
TRUMP, Nobody cares.
WALLACE," Gentlemen, can we move on to the economy?"
TRUMP, Yes.
WALLACE," The economy is, I think it’s fair to say, recovering faster than expected from the shutdown-"
TRUMP, Much faster.
WALLACE," … in the second quarter. The unemployment rate fell to 8.4% last month. The Federal Reserve says the hit to growth, which is going to be there, is not going to be nearly as big as they had expected. President Trump, you say we are in a V-shaped recovery. Vice President Biden, you say it’s more of a K-shape. What difference does that mean to the American people in terms of the economy? President Trump, in this segment you go first."
TRUMP," So we built the greatest economy in history. We closed it down because of the China plague. When the plague came in, we closed it down, which was very hard psychologically to do. He didn’t think we should close it down and he was wrong. Again, two million people would be dead now instead of… Still, 204,000 people is too much. One person is too much. Should have never happened from China. But what happened is we closed it down and now we’re reopening and we’re doing record business. We had 10.4 million people in a four-month period that we’ve put back into the workforce. That’s a record the likes of which nobody’s ever seen before. And he wants to close down the… He will shut it down again. He will destroy this country."
TRUMP," A lot of people, between drugs and alcohol and depression, when you start shutting it down, you take a look at what’s happening at some of your Democrat-run states where they have these tough shutdowns. And I’m telling you it’s because they don’t want to open it. One of them came out last week, you saw that, “Oh, we’re going to open up on November 9th.” Why November 9th? Because it’s after the election. They think they’re hurting us by keeping them closed. They’re hurting people. People know what to do. They can social distance. They can wash their hands, they can wear masks. They can do whatever they want, but they got to open these states up."
TRUMP," When you look at North Carolina, when you look, and these governors are under siege, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and a couple of others, you got to open these states up. It’s not fair. You’re talking about almost it’s like being in prison. And you look at what’s going on with divorce, look at what’s going on with alcoholism and drugs. It’s a very, very sad thing. And he’ll close down the whole country. This guy will close down the whole country and destroy our country. Our country is coming back incredibly well, setting records as it does it. We don’t need somebody to come in and say, “Let’s shut it down.”"
WALLACE," All right. Your two minutes, sir. We’re now moved to you. As I said, posing the question, the president says it’s a V-shape recovery, you say it’s a K-shaped recovery. What’s the difference?"
BIDEN," The difference is millionaires and billionaires like him in the middle of the COVID crisis have done very well. Billionaires have made another $300 billion because of his profligate tax proposal, and he only focused on the market. But you folks at home, you folks living in Scranton and Claymont and all the small towns and working class towns in America, how well are you doing? This guy paid a total of $750 in taxes."
TRUMP, That’s wrong.
WALLACE," Sir, wait. No. Sir-"
TRUMP, [crosstalk].
WALLACE," Yeah, I understand. You’ve agreed to the two minutes, so please let him have it."
BIDEN," Do I get my time back? The fact is that he has in fact, worked on this in a way that he’s going to be the first president of the United States to leave office, having fewer jobs in his administration than when he became president. Fewer jobs than when he became president. First one in American history."
BIDEN," Secondly, the people who have lost their jobs are those people who have been on the front lines. Those people who have been saving our lives, those people who have been out there dying. People who’ve been putting themselves in the way to make sure that we could all try to make it. And the idea that he is insisting that we go forward and open when you have almost half the states in America with a significant increase in COVID deaths and COVID cases in the United States of America, and he wants to open it up more. Why is he want to open it up? Why doesn’t he take care of the… You can’t fix the economy until you fix the COVID crisis. And he has no intention of doing anything about making it better for you all at home in terms of your health and your safety."
BIDEN," Schools. Why aren’t schools open? Because it costs a lot of money to open them safely. They were going to give, his Administration going to give the teachers and school students masks, and then they decided no, couldn’t do that because it’s not a national emergency. Not a national emergency. They’ve done nothing to help small businesses. Nothing. They’re closing. One in six is now gone. He ought to get on the job and take care of the needs of the American people so we can open safely."
WALLACE," All right. Your time is up, sir. We are going to get to-"
TRUMP, I have to respond to that.
WALLACE," Well, you both had two minutes, sir."
TRUMP," Excuse me, he made a statement."
WALLACE, And so did you.
TRUMP," No, people want their schools open. They don’t want to be shut down. They don’t want their state shut down. They want their restaurants. I look at New York. It’s so sad what’s happening in New York. It’s almost like a ghost town, and I’m not sure it can ever recover what they’ve done to New York. People want their places open. They want to get back to their lives."
BIDEN, People want to be safe.
TRUMP," They’ll be careful, but they want their schools open."
BIDEN, People want to be safe.
TRUMP," I’m the one that brought back football. By the way, I brought back Big Ten football. It was me and I’m very happy to do it-"
WALLACE, All right. Let’s-
TRUMP, … and people of Ohio are very proud of me. And you know how I found out? When [crosstalk].
WALLACE," Gentlemen, we’re going to get to your economic plans going forward in a moment, but first, Mr. President, as you well know, there’s a new report that in 2016, the year you were elected president, and 2017, your first year as president, that you paid $750 a year in federal income tax each of those years. I know that you pay a lot of other taxes, but I’m asking you this specific question. Is it true that you paid $750 in federal income taxes each of those two years?"
TRUMP," I paid millions of dollars in taxes, millions of dollars of income tax. And let me just tell you, there was a story in one of the papers that paid-"
BIDEN, Show us your tax returns.
TRUMP," I paid $38 million one year, I paid $27 million one year."
BIDEN, Show us your tax returns.
TRUMP," You’ll see it as soon as it’s finished, you’ll see it. You know, if you wanted to, go to the Board of Elections. There’s 118 page or so report that says everything I have, every bank I have, I’m totally under leveraged because the assets are extremely good, and I built a great company."
WALLACE," Sir, I’m asking you a specific question, which is-"
TRUMP, But let me tell you-
WALLACE, I understand all of that.
BIDEN, Release your tax return.
WALLACE, I understand all of that-
TRUMP, Let me-
WALLACE," No, Mr. President, I’m asking you a question. Will you tell us how much you paid in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017?"
TRUMP, Millions of dollars.
WALLACE, You paid millions of dollars in-
TRUMP," Millions of dollars, yes."
WALLACE, So not 750?
TRUMP, Millions of dollars. And you’ll get to see it. And you’ll get to see it.
BIDEN, When?
TRUMP, But let me just tell you-
BIDEN, In [crosstalk]?
TRUMP," Chris, let me just say something, that it was the tax laws. I don’t want to pay tax. Before I came here, I was a private developer, I was a private business people. Like every other private person, unless they’re stupid, they go through the laws, and that’s what it is. He passed a tax bill that gave us all these privileges for depreciation and for tax credits. We built the building and we get tax credits, like the hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. Which by the way, was given to me by the Obama Administration, if you can believe that. Now the man got fired right after that happened, but that’s-"
WALLACE," Vice President Biden, you want to respond?"
BIDEN," Yeah, I do want to respond. Look, the tax code that put him in a position that he pays less tax than on the money a school teacher makes is because of him… He says he’s smart because he can take advantage of the tax code. And he does take advantage of the tax code. That’s why I’m going to eliminate the Trump tax cuts. And I’m going to eliminate those tax cuts."
TRUMP, That’s okay.
BIDEN, And make sure that we invest in the people who in fact need the help. People out there need help.
TRUMP, But why didn’t you do it over the last 25 years?
BIDEN, Because you weren’t president-
TRUMP, Why didn’t you do it over the last 25 years?
BIDEN, Because you weren’t president and screwing things up.
TRUMP, You were a Senator and [crosstalk]-
BIDEN, You’re the worst president America has ever had. Come on.
TRUMP," Hey, Joe, let me just tell you, Joe. In 47 months, I’ve done more than you’ve done in 47 years, Joe. We’ve done things that you never even thought of doing."
WALLACE, Okay. Gentlemen?
TRUMP," Including fixing the broken military that you gave me, including taking care of your debts."
WALLACE," Mr. President, we’re talking about the economy. I’d like to ask you about your plans going forward because Mr. Vice President, your economic plan-"
TRUMP, He has none.
WALLACE," … if you were to be elected president focuses a lot on big government, big taxes, big spending. I want to focus first on the taxes. You propose more than $4 trillion over a decade in new taxes on individuals making more than $400,000 a year."
WALLACE, … and on corporations. President Trump says that that kind of an increase in taxes is going to hurt the economy as it’s just coming out of a recession.
BIDEN," Well, just take a look at what is the analysis done by Wall Street firms, points out that my economic plan would create 7 million more jobs than his in four years, number one. And number two, it would create an additional $1 trillion in economic growth, because it would be about buying American. The federal government spends $600 billion a year on everything from ships, to steel, to buildings and the like. And under my proposal, we’re going to make sure that every penny of that has to be made by a company-"
WALLACE," But respectfully, sir, I’m talking about taxes, not spending."
BIDEN," By the way, I’m going to eliminate a significant number of the taxes. I’m going to make the corporate tax 28%. It shouldn’t be 21%. You have 91 companies federal, I mean, the fortune 500, who don’t pay a single penny in tax making billions of dollars."
TRUMP," Why didn’t you do it before, when you were Vice-President with Obama?"
BIDEN," Because you in fact passed that, that was your tax proposal."
TRUMP, I got it done. And you know what happened?
BIDEN," Yeah, you got it done-"
TRUMP, Our economy boomed like it’s never boomed before.
BIDEN, The economy-
WALLACE, Mr. President-
BIDEN, Let me finish.
WALLACE," Mr. President, let me pick up on that. You would continue your free market approach, lower taxes, more deregulation, correct?"
BIDEN, Not lower tax for the American people.
WALLACE, But let me-
TRUMP, Excuse me.
WALLACE," You talk about the economy booming. It turns out that in Obama’s final three years as president more jobs were created, a million and a half more jobs, than in the first three years of your presidency."
TRUMP," They had the slowest economic recovery since 1929. It was the slowest recovery. Also, they took over something that was down here. All you had to do is turn on the lights and you pick up a lot. But they had the slowest economic recovery since 1929, and let me tell you about the stock market. When the stock market goes up, that means jobs. It also means 401ks. If you got in, if you ever became president with your ideas, you want to terminate my taxes. I’ll tell you what, you’ll lose. Half of the companies that have poured in here will leave. And plenty of companies that are already here, they’ll leave for other places. [crosstalk] They will leave and you will have a depression, the likes of which you’ve never seen."
BIDEN, Look-
WALLACE, Mr. Vice President.
BIDEN," … we inherited the worst recession, short of a depression in American history. I was asked to bring it back. We were able to have an economic recovery that created the jobs you’re talking about. We handed him a booming economy, he blew it."
TRUMP, It wasn’t booming.
BIDEN, He blew it.
TRUMP, It wasn’t booming. It was the weakest recovery since 1929.
WALLACE," Wait, wait, is it fair to say he blew it when, in fact-"
TRUMP, When COVID came along.
WALLACE, … when there was record low unemployment before COVID.
BIDEN," Yeah, because what he did, even before COVID, manufacturing went in the hole. Manufacturing went in a hole-"
TRUMP," Excuse me, Chris, wait."
BIDEN, … number one. Number two-
TRUMP, Chris.
BIDEN, Number three.
TRUMP," They said it would take… No, you’re on number two."
BIDEN, No.
TRUMP," Chris, Chris. They said it would take-"
BIDEN, This guy-
TRUMP," … a miracle to bring back manufacturing. I brought back 700,000 jobs. They brought back nothing. They gave up on manufacturing."
BIDEN, We did not. [crosstalk]
TRUMP, … standard fare.
BIDEN, I’m the guy that brought back the automobile industry.
TRUMP, He totally gave up on manufacturing.
WALLACE," All right, let him-"
BIDEN," I was asked to bring back Chrysler and General Motors. We brought them back right here in the state of Ohio and Michigan. He blew it. They’re gone. He blew it. And in fact, they’re gone-"
TRUMP, Ohio had the best year it’s ever had last year. Michigan had the best year they’ve ever had.
BIDEN, That is not true.
TRUMP," Many car companies came in from Germany, from Japan, went to Michigan, went to Ohio and they didn’t come in with you. [crosstalk]."
WALLACE," Mr. Vice President, go ahead."
BIDEN, And so you take a look at what he’s actually done. He’s done very little. His trade deals are the same way. He talks about these great trade deals. He talks about the art of the deal. China’s perfected the art of the steal. We have a higher deficit with China now than we did before. We have the highest trade deficit-
TRUMP, China ate your lunch- [crosstalk].
BIDEN, … with Mexico.
TRUMP," China ate your lunch, Joe. And no wonder your son goes in and, wha–, he takes out billions of dollars. He takes out billions of dollars to manage. He makes millions of dollars. And also, while we’re at it, why is it just out of curiosity, the mayor of Moscow’s wife gave your son three and a half million dollars?"
BIDEN, That is not true.
TRUMP, What did he do to deserve it? What did he do with Burisma-
BIDEN, None of that is true.
TRUMP," … to deserve $183,000?"
WALLACE," Sir, you’ve asked him a question, let him answer it."
BIDEN, None of that is true.
TRUMP," Oh really, he didn’t get three and a half million?"
WALLACE, Mr. President-
BIDEN, Is totally-
WALLACE," Mr. President, please. You’ve asked a question- [crosstalk]"
BIDEN, Totally discredited. Totally discredited. And by the way-
TRUMP," Well wait, he didn’t get three and a half million dollars, Joe?"
BIDEN, Mr. Vice-
TRUMP, He got three and a half million dollars-
WALLACE, Mr. President.
TRUMP, … dollars.
BIDEN, That is not true.
TRUMP," Oh, really?"
WALLACE," Mr. President, it’s an open discussion. Please- [crosstalk]"
TRUMP, It’s a fact.
BIDEN, It is not a fact.
WALLACE," Well, you have raised an issue, let the Vice President answer."
BIDEN, It’s been totally discredited.
TRUMP," Did Burisma pay him 183 thousand a month, with no experience in energy?"
WALLACE, Mr. President-
BIDEN, My son did nothing wrong at Burisma-
TRUMP, I think he did.
BIDEN, The only guy that. . .
WALLACE," Mr. President, let him answer. [crosstalk]."
BIDEN," He doesn’t want to let me answer, because he knows I have the truth. His position has been totally thoroughly discredited. . ."
TRUMP, By who?
BIDEN, And you can-
TRUMP, The media.
BIDEN," by everybody. Well, by the media, by our allies."
TRUMP," By the media, because they refuse to talk about it-"
BIDEN, By the World Bank-
TRUMP, … because they’re embarrassed.
BIDEN," By everyone, as discredited. And matter of fact [crosstalk] Matter of fact-"
WALLACE," Mr. President, please stop."
BIDEN, Even the people who testified under oath-
TRUMP," So let me ask you this, Joe- [crosstalk]."
WALLACE," No, no. Go ahead, Mr.– I’m listening to you."
BIDEN, Even the people under-
TRUMP, He got three and a half million dollars from Moscow.
BIDEN," … testified, he testified under oath in his Administration said I did my job and I did it very well."
TRUMP," Oh, really?"
BIDEN, I did it honorably.
TRUMP, I’d like to know who they are.
BIDEN," Well, I’ll give you the list of the people who-"
TRUMP, I’ll fire them.
WALLACE," No, no. Go ahead, sir."
BIDEN," I’m sure that you’ve already fired most of them, because they did a good job."
TRUMP, Some people don’t do a good job.
BIDEN," Well, here’s the- [crosstalk]"
WALLACE," Go ahead. You get the- [crosstalk] Wait a minute. You get the final word, Mr.-"
BIDEN," Well, it’s hard to get any word in with this clown. Excuse me, this person."
TRUMP," Hey, hey, let me just say, that"
BIDEN," No, no. Mr. President- [crosstalk]"
TRUMP," Three and a half million, Joe."
BIDEN, That is simply not true.
TRUMP, Why did he deserve three and a half million from Moscow?
BIDEN," Look, here’s the deal. We want to talk about families and ethics. I don’t want to do that. I mean, his family, we could talk about all night. His family’s already-"
TRUMP, My family-
WALLACE," No, no- [crosstalk]."
TRUMP, My family lost a fortune by coming down and helping us with government.
BIDEN, And that’s such a- [crosstalk]
WALLACE, Mr. President-
TRUMP, Every single one of them lost a fortune by coming down and helping us with government.
BIDEN," This is not about my family or his family. It’s about your family, the American people. [crosstalk]"
TRUMP, And he got three and a half million dollars for nothing.
BIDEN," That’s not true. It doesn’t want to talk about what you need. You, the American people. It’s about you. That’s what we’re talking about here. [crosstalk]"
WALLACE, That’s the end of the segment. We’re moving on.
BIDEN, He didn’t take that.
WALLACE, Vice President-
TRUMP," Chris, can I be honest? It’s a very important question-"
BIDEN, Try to be honest.
WALLACE, No.
TRUMP, He stood up-
WALLACE, The answer to the question is no.
TRUMP, … and he threatened Ukraine-
WALLACE, Sir-
TRUMP, … with a billion dollars-
BIDEN, That is absolutely not true.
WALLACE," Stop. [crosstalk] Gentlemen, I hate to raise my voice, but I- [crosstalk] Why should I be different than the two of you? So here’s the deal."
BIDEN, That’s a good point.
WALLACE," We have six segments. We have ended that segment. We’re going to go to the next segment. In that segment, you each are going to have two uninterrupted moments. In those two uninterrupted minutes, Mr. President, you can say anything you want. I’m going to ask a question about race, but if you want to answer about something else, go ahead. But we, I, I think that the country would be better served, if we allowed both people to speak with fewer interruptions. I’m appealing to you, sir, to do that."
TRUMP," Well, and him too."
WALLACE," Well, frankly, you’ve been doing more interrupting than he has."
TRUMP," Well, that’s all right, but he does plenty."
WALLACE," Well, sir, less than-"
TRUMP, He does plenty.
WALLACE," No, less than you have. Let’s please continue on. The issue of race. Vice-President Biden, you say that President Trump’s response to the violence in Charlottesville three years ago, when he talked about very fine people on both sides, was what directly led you to launch this run for president."
TRUMP," Oh yeah, sure."
WALLACE," President Trump, you have often said that you believe you will have done more for Black Americans than any president with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln."
TRUMP, That’s true.
WALLACE," My question for the two of you, is why should voters trust you rather than your opponent to deal with the race issues facing this country over the next four years? Vice President Biden, you go first."
BIDEN," It’s about equity and equality. It’s about decency. It’s about the Constitution. And we have never walked away from trying to require, acquire equity for everyone, equality for the whole of America. But we’ve never accomplished it, but we’ve never walked away from it like he has done. It is true, the reason I got in the race is when those people. . . Close your eyes, remember what those people look like coming out of the fields, carrying torches, their veins bulging, spewing–just spewing anti-Semitic bile and accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan. A young woman got killed, and they asked the president what he thought. He said, “There were very fine people on both sides.” No president’s ever said anything like that. [crosstalk]."
WALLACE, It is his-
BIDEN, Now-
WALLACE, … two minutes sir.
BIDEN," … second point I’d make to you, is that when Floyd was killed, when Mr. Floyd was killed, there was a peaceful protest in front of the White House. What did he do? He came out of his bunker, had the military use tear gas on them so he could walk across to a church and hold up a Bible. And then what happened after that? The Bishop of that very church said that it was a disgrace. The general who was with him said “All he ever wants to do is divide people, not unite people at all.” This is a president who has used everything as a dog whistle, to try to generate racist hatred, racist division."
TRUMP, So-
WALLACE," President Trump, you have two minutes. Why should Americans trust you over your opponent to deal with race issues?"
TRUMP," You did a crime bill, 1994, where you called them super-predators. African-Americans are super-predators and they’ve never forgotten it. They’ve never forgotten it."
BIDEN, I’ve never said-
WALLACE," No, no, sir. It’s his two minutes."
TRUMP," So you did that, and they call you super-predator and I’m letting people out of jail now, that you have treated the African-American population community, you have treated the black community about as bad as anybody in this country. You did the 1990–and that’s why, if you look at the polls, I’m doing better than any Republican has done in a long time, because they saw what you did. You call them super-predators, and you’ve called them worse than that. Because you look back at your testimony over the years, you’ve called them a lot worse than that. As far as the church is concerned, and as far as the generals are concerned, we just got the support of 200–250 military leaders and generals, total support. Law enforcement, almost every law enforcement group in the United States. I have Florida. I have Texas. I have Ohio. I have every… Excuse me, Portland, the sheriff just came out today and he said, “I support President Trump.”"
WALLACE," All right. I want to return to the question of race. Vice President Biden, after the grand jury in the Breonna Taylor case decided not to charge any of the police with homicide, you said it raises the question, “Whether justice could be equally applied in America.” Do you believe that there is a separate but unequal system of justice for Blacks in this country?"
BIDEN," Yes, there is. There’s systemic injustice in this country, in education and work and in law enforcement and the way in which it’s enforced. But look, the vast majority of police officers are good, decent, honorable men and women. They risk their lives every day to take care of us. But there are some bad apples. And when they occur, when they find them, they have to be sorted out. They have to be held accountable. They have to be held accountable. And what I’m going to do as President of the United States is call a, a, together an entire group of people at the White House, everything from the civil rights groups, to the police officers, to the police chiefs, and we’re going to work this out."
WALLACE," All right, Mr.-"
TRUMP, What is peaceful protest? When they run through the middle of the town-
WALLACE, President Trump-
TRUMP, … and burn down your stores and kill people all over the place- [crosstalk].
BIDEN, That is not peaceful protest.
TRUMP," No it’s not, but you say it is."
BIDEN, I did not say it is.
WALLACE," President Trump, I’d like to continue with the issue of race. I promise we’re going to get to the issue of law and order in a moment."
TRUMP, Fine.
WALLACE," This month, your Administration, uh, directed federal agencies to end racial sensitivity training that addresses white privilege or critical race theory. Why did you decide to do that, to end racial sensitivity training? And do you believe that there is systemic racism in this country, sir?"
TRUMP," I ended it because it’s racist. I ended it because a lot of people were complaining that they were asked to do things that were absolutely insane. That it was a radical revolution that was taking place in our military, in our schools, all over the place. And you know it, and so does everybody else. And he would know it, oh it’s totally racial. [crosstalk]"
WALLACE, What is radical about racial sensitivity training?
TRUMP," If you were a certain person, you had no status in life. It was sort of a reversal. And if you look at the people, we would pay people hundreds of thousands of dollars to teach very bad ideas and frankly, very sick ideas. And, and really, they were teaching people to hate our country. And I’m not going to do that. I’m not going to allow that to happen. We have to go back to the core values of this country. They were teaching people that our country is a horrible place. It’s a racist place. And they were teaching people to hate our country. And I’m not going to allow that to happen."
BIDEN, Nobody’s doing that.
WALLACE, Vice President Biden.
BIDEN, Nobody’s doing that. He’s the racist.
TRUMP, You just don’t know.
BIDEN, Here’s the deal. I know a lot more about this- [crosstalk].
TRUMP, You don’t know.
WALLACE, Let him finish.
BIDEN," The fact is that there is racial insensitivity. People have to be made aware of what other people feel like, uh, what insults them, what is demeaning to them. It’s important that people know. Many people don’t want to hurt other people’s feelings. But it’s amazing, it makes a big difference. It makes a gigantic difference in the way a child is able to grow up and have a self-sense, a sense of self-esteem. It’s a little bit like how this guy and, and his friends look down on so many people. They look down their nose on people like Irish Catholics, like me, and grew up in Scranton. They look down on people who don’t have money. They look down on people who are of a different faith. They look down on people who are a different color. In fact, we’re all Americans. The only way we’re gonna bring this country together is bring everybody together. There’s nothing we cannot do, if we do it together. We can take this on, and we can defeat racism in America."
WALLACE," Vice President… I mean, President Trump, sir."
TRUMP," During the Obama-Biden Administration, there was tremendous division. There was hatred. You look at, uh, Ferguson, you look at, or you go to very…many places. Look at Oakland. Look what happened in Oakland. Look what happened in Baltimore. Look what happened a . . . Frankly, it was more violent than what I’m even seeing now."
BIDEN, Oh my Lord.
TRUMP, But the reason-
BIDEN, This is ridiculous.
TRUMP, … is that the Democrats that run these cities-
BIDEN, Absolutely ridiculous.
TRUMP," … don’t want to talk, like you, about law and order."
BIDEN, Violent crime. . .
TRUMP, And you still haven’t mentioned.
BIDEN, Violent crime. . .
TRUMP, Are you in favor of law and order?
BIDEN, I’m in favor of law. You follow a little bit of order- [crosstalk].
TRUMP, Are you in favor of law and order? [crosstalk]
BIDEN, Yes I’m in favor of. . .
WALLACE," You asked a question, let him finish. [crosstalk] Let him answer."
BIDEN," Law and order with justice, where people get treated fairly."
TRUMP, Okay.
BIDEN," And the fact of the matter is, violent crime went down 17 percent, 15 percent in our Administration. It’s gone up on his watch."
WALLACE, Okay.
TRUMP, It went down much more in ours.
WALLACE," All right, we’re done- [crosstalk] Mr. President, you’re going to be very happy because we’re now going to talk about law and order."
TRUMP, The places we had trouble were Democratic-run cities. . .
WALLACE," That’s exactly my question. There has been a dramatic increase in homicides in America this summer particularly, and you often blame that on Democratic mayors and Democratic governors. But in fact, there have been equivalent spikes in Republican-led cities, like Tulsa and Fort Worth. So the question is, is this really a party issue?"
TRUMP," I think it’s a party issue. You can bring in a couple of examples but if you look at Chicago, what’s going on in Chicago where, uh, 53 people were shot and eight died. Shot. If you look at New York where it’s going up, like nobody’s ever seen anything. The numbers are going up a 100, 150, 200 percent, uh, crime, it is crazy what’s going on . . ."
BIDEN," Republican cities, republican cities."
TRUMP," . . . and he doesn’t want to say law and order because he can’t because he’ll lose his radical left supporters and once he does that, it’s over with. But if he ever got to run this country, and they ran it the way he would want to run it, we would have. . ."
BIDEN, By the way. . .
TRUMP," . . . our suburbs would be gone. By the way, our suburbs would be gone. And you would see problems like you’ve never seen before."
BIDEN," He wouldn’t know a suburb unless you took a wrong turn. He was, he was. . ."
TRUMP," Oh, I know suburbs so much better than you."
WALLACE, Gentlemen wait a minute.
BIDEN," I was raised in the suburbs. This is not 1950. All these dog whistles and racism don’t work anymore. Suburbs are by and large integrated. There’s as many people today driving their kids to soccer practice and/or black and white and Hispanic in the same car as there have been any time in the past. What’s, what really is a threat to the suburbs and their safety is his failure to deal with COVID. They’re dying in the suburbs. His failure to deal with the environment, they’re being flooded, they’re being burned out because his refusal to do anything. That’s why the suburbs are in trouble."
WALLACE," I do want to talk about this issue of law and order though. And in the joint recommendation that came from the Biden-Bernie Sanders task force, you talked about quote re-imagining policing. First of all, what does re-imagining policing mean and do you support?"
BIDEN, It means. . .
WALLACE," . . . If I might finish the question, what does re-imagining policing mean and do you support the Black Lives Matter call uh, for uh, community control of policing?"
BIDEN," Look, what I support is the police having the opportunity to deal with the problems they face and I’m totally opposed to defunding the police offices. As a matter of fact police, local police, the only one defunding, in his budget calls for a $400 million cut in local law enforcement assistance. They need more assistance. They need when they show up for a 9-11 call to have someone with them as a psychologist or psychiatrist to keep them from having to use force and be able to talk people down. We have to have community policing like we had before, where the officers get to know the people in the communities. That’s when crime went down, it didn’t go up. It went down. And so we have to be engaged with . . ."
TRUMP," That’s not what they are talking about, Chris. That’s not what it . . . He’s talking about defunding the police."
BIDEN, That’s exactly. . . that is not true.
TRUMP, He doesn’t have any law support. He has no law enforcement support.
TRUMP, Almost nothing.
BIDEN," That’s not true. That’s not. . . Oh, look. . ."
TRUMP," Oh, really, who do you have? Name one group that supports you. Name one group that came out and supported you. Go ahead. Think. We have time."
BIDEN, We don’t have time to do anything except . . .
TRUMP," No, no. Think about it. Name one law enforcement group that came out in support of you."
BIDEN," Folks, folks. . ."
WALLACE," Now, gentleman. I think I’m going to take back the moderator’s role. . ."
TRUMP, There aren’t any. I don’t think there are any.
WALLACE," . . . and I want to get to another subject, which is the issue of protests in many cities that have turned violent. In Portland, Oregon, especially we had a, more than a hundred straight days of protests, which I think you would agree, you talk about peaceful protests. Many of those turned into riots. Mr. Vice-President you say that people who commit crimes should be held accountable. The question I have, though, is as the Democratic nominee, and earlier tonight, you said that you are the Democratic Party right now, have you ever called the Democratic Mayor of Portland or the Democratic Governor of Oregon and said, “Hey, you gotta stop this, bring in the National Guard, do whatever it takes, but you’d stop the days and months of violence in Portland.”"
BIDEN," I don’t hold public office, now. I am a former Vice-President. I’ve made it clear. I’ve made it clear in my public statements that the violence should be prosecuted. It should be prosecuted, and anyone who commits it should be prosecuted."
WALLACE, But you’ve never called for the people…
TRUMP, He’s never done that.
WALLACE," Excuse me, sir. You had never called for the leaders in Portland and in Oregon to call and bring in the National Guard and knock off a 100 days of riots."
BIDEN, They can in fact take care of it if he’d just stay out of the way.
TRUMP, Oh really? Oh really?
WALLACE," Let, let’s just. . ."
TRUMP, I sent in the US Marshals. . .
BIDEN," Here, here’s the thing. . ."
WALLACE, I asked a question. . .
TRUMP," . . .to get the killer of a young man in the middle of the street, they shot him. For three days Portland didn’t do anything."
WALLACE, President Trump. President Trump. President Trump. . . I interrupted. President Trump.
TRUMP, I sent in the US Marshals they took care of business.
WALLACE, Go ahead sir.
BIDEN," And by the way his own former spokesperson said, you know, “Riots and chaos and violence help his cause.” That’s what this is all about."
TRUMP, I don’t know who said that.
BIDEN, I do.
TRUMP, Who?
BIDEN, I think it–Kellyanne Conway.
TRUMP, I don’t think she said that.
BIDEN, She said that.
TRUMP, I don’t think so.
BIDEN," And so here, here’s the point. The point is that, that’s what he is keep trying to rile everything up. He doesn’t want to calm things down. Instead of going in and talking to people and saying, “Let’s get everybody together. Figure out how to deal with this.” What’s he do? He just pours gasoline in the fire. Constantly. At every single solitary time."
WALLACE," Okay. And, and, and to end this, button up this segment, I’m going to give you a minute to answer, sir. You have repeatedly…"
TRUMP," You mean, I have to answer his stuff?"
WALLACE, You have repeatedly…
TRUMP, His statement?
WALLACE, You have repeatedly. . . No. . .
TRUMP," Wait a second, you made a statement."
WALLACE," No, you’ve been talking back and forth. I’m asking you."
TRUMP, I would love to end it. I would love to end it.
WALLACE, I would love to know sir. . . You know sir if you want to switch seats
TRUMP," . . . we could, very quickly"
WALLACE, . . . we can do that.
TRUMP," I’ll send in the National Guard, it would be over. That’d be no problem. But they don’t want to accept the National Guard."
WALLACE," You have repeatedly criticized the Vice-President for not specifically calling out Antifa and other left-wing extremist groups. But are you willing, tonight, to condemn white supremacists and militia groups and to say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities as we saw in Kenosha and as we’ve seen in Portland."
TRUMP," Sure, I’m willing to do that."
WALLACE," Are you prepared specifically to do it. Well go ahead, sir."
TRUMP, I would say almost everything I see is from the left-wing not from the right wing.
WALLACE," So what are you, what are you saying?"
TRUMP, I’m willing to do anything. I want to see peace.
WALLACE," Well, do it, sir."
BIDEN, Say it. Do it. Say it.
TRUMP," You want to call them? What do you want to call them? Give me a name, give me a name, go ahead who would you like me to condemn."
WALLACE, White supremacists and racists.
BIDEN, Proud Boys.
WALLACE, White supremacists and white militias.
BIDEN, Proud Boys.
TRUMP," Proud Boys, stand back and stand by. But I’ll tell you what, I’ll tell you what: somebody’s got to do something about Antifa and the left because this is not a right wing problem this is a left-wing. This is a left-wing problem. . ."
BIDEN, He’s own FBI Director said unlike white supremacists. . .
TRUMP, This is a left-wing problem.
BIDEN, Antifa is an idea not an organization. . .
TRUMP, Oh you gotta be kidding.
BIDEN, … not a militia. That’s what his FBI Director said.
TRUMP," Well, then you know what, he’s wrong."
WALLACE," Gentlemen, gentlemen. No, no, no, we’re done, sir. Moving onto the next… [crosstalk]"
TRUMP," . . . when a bat hits you over the head, that’s not an idea. Antifa is bad."
BIDEN, Everybody in your Administration. . .
TRUMP, Antifa is bad.
BIDEN," Everybody in your Administration tells you the truth, has a bad idea. You have no idea . . . ."
TRUMP," You know what, Antifa is a dangerous radical group."
WALLACE," All right, gentlemen we’re now moving onto the Trump and Biden records."
TRUMP," And you ought to be careful of them, they’ll overthrow you."
WALLACE," I’m going to ask a question. When the president seeks a second term, it is generally a referendum on his record but Vice-President Biden, you like to quote one of your dad’s sayings, which is don’t compare me to the almighty, compare me to the alternative. And in this case sir you are the alternative. Looking at both of your records, I’m going to ask each of you. Why should voters elect you president over your opponent? In this segment, President Trump you’ll go first, two minutes."
TRUMP," Because there has never been an administration or president who has done more than I’ve done in a period of three and a half years. And that’s despite the impeachment hoax and you saw what happened today with Hillary Clinton, where it was a whole big con job. But despite going through all of these things where I had to fight, both flanks and behind me and above, there has never been an administration that’s done what I’ve done. The greatest, before COVID came in, the greatest economy in history, lowest employ–unemployment numbers, everything was good. Everything was going."
WALLACE," Looking at both of your records. Why should voters elect you President as opposed to President Trump, you have two minutes uninterrupted."
BIDEN," Under this President, we become weaker, sicker, poorer, more divided and more violent. When I was Vice President, we inherited a recession. I was asked to fix it. I did. We left him a booming economy, and he caused the recession. With regard to being weaker, the fact is that I’ve gone head to head with Putin and made it clear to him we’re not going to take any of his stuff. He’s Putin’s puppy. He still refuses to even say anything to Putin about the bounty on the heads of American soldiers."
TRUMP, Your son got three and a half million dollars.
WALLACE," No, no, no!"
BIDEN," By the way, my son…"
WALLACE," Wait a minute. Mr. President, your campaign agreed to both sides would get two-minute answers, uninterrupted. Well, your, your side agreed to it, and why don’t you observe what your campaign agreed to as a ground rule. Okay, sir?"
BIDEN, He never keeps his word.
TRUMP, Can I answer. . .
WALLACE, No! That was a rhetorical question.
BIDEN, Can you add back 30 seconds?
WALLACE," Yes. You may have,"
BIDEN, All right.
WALLACE, go ahead.
BIDEN," So thirdly, we’re poor. The billionaires have gotten much more wealthy by a tune of over three to four hundred billion dollars more just since COVID. You in the home, you got less. You’re in more trouble than you were before. In terms of being more violent. When we were in office there were 15% less violence in America than there is today. He’s President of the United States. It’s on his watch. And with regard to more divided, the nation, it can’t stay divided. We can’t be this way. And speaking of my son, the way you talk about the military, the way you talk about them being losers and being, and, and, and just being suckers. My son was in Iraq. He spent a year there. He got, he got the Bronze Star. He got the Conspicuous Service Medal. He was not a loser. He was a patriot and the people left behind, there, were heroes."
TRUMP, Really?
BIDEN, And I resent-
TRUMP," Are you talking Hunter, are you talking about Hunter."
BIDEN," I’m talking about my son, Beau Biden, you’re talking about Hunter?"
TRUMP, I don’t know Beau. I know Hunter. Hunter got thrown out of the military. He was thrown out dishonorably discharged. . .
BIDEN, That’s not true he wasn’t dishonorably discharged.
TRUMP, . . .for cocaine use. And he didn’t have a job until you became Vice-President. Once you became Vice-President
BIDEN, None of that is true.
TRUMP," . . . he made a fortune in Ukraine, in China, in Moscow and various other places."
BIDEN, That is simply not true.
TRUMP, He made a fortune. . .
BIDEN, My son. . . my son. . .
TRUMP, . . . and he didn’t have a job.
BIDEN," My son. . . like a lot of people. Like a lot of people we know at home had a drug problem. He’s overtaken it. He’s, he’s fixed it. He’s worked on it. And I’m proud of him. I’m proud of my son."
TRUMP, But why was he given tens of millions of dollars?
WALLACE, Alright. . .
BIDEN, He wasn’t given tens of millions of dollars. [crosstalk]
TRUMP, He was given tens of millions of dollars?
BIDEN, That was totally discredited.
WALLACE, President Trump. President Trump. We’ve already been through this.
BIDEN, Totally discredited.
WALLACE, We’ve bo. . .already been through this. I think the American people would rather hear about more substantial subjects.
BIDEN, So do I.
TRUMP, [unintelligible]
WALLACE," Well, as the moderator, sir, I’m going to make a judgment call here."
TRUMP, I know but when somebody gets three and a half million dollars from the Mayor of Moscow.
BIDEN, That is not true. That report is totally discredited.
TRUMP, Why did he get it?
BIDEN, Mitt Romney on that committee said it wasn’t worth taxpayer’s money. That report was written for political reason.
WALLACE, I’d like to talk about climate change.
BIDEN, So would I.
WALLACE," Okay. The forest fires in the West are raging now. They have burned millions of acres. They have displaced hundreds of thousands of people. When state officials there blamed the fires on climate change, Mr. President, you said, “I don’t think the science knows.” Over your four years, you have pulled the US out of the Paris Climate Accord. You have rolled back a number of Obama Environmental records, what do you believe about the science of climate change, and what will you do in the next four years to confront it?"
TRUMP," I want crystal clean water and air. I want beautiful clean air. We have now the lowest carbon. If you look at our numbers right now, we are doing phenomenally. But I haven’t destroyed our businesses. Our businesses aren’t put out of commission. If you look at the Paris Accord, it was a disaster from our standpoint. And people are actually very happy about what’s going on, because our businesses are doing well. As far as the fires are concerned, you need forest management. In addition to everything else, the forest floors are loaded up with trees, dead trees that are years old and they’re like tinder and leaves and everything else. You drop a cigarette in there the whole forest burns down. You’ve got to have forest management."
WALLACE," What do you believe about the science of climate change, sir?"
TRUMP," I believe that we have to do everything we can to have immaculate air, immaculate water, and do whatever else we can that’s good. You know, we’re planting a billion trees–the Billion Tree Project–and it’s very exciting for a lot of people."
WALLACE," You believe that human pollution, gas, greenhouse gas emissions contributes to the global warming of this planet?"
TRUMP," I think a lot of things do, but I think to an extent, yes. I think to an extent, yes. But I also think we have to do better management of our forests. Every year I get the call. California’s burning, California’s burning. If that was cleaned, if that were, if you had forest management, good forest management, you wouldn’t be getting those calls. You know, in Europe, they live their forest cities. They call forest cities. They maintain their forest. They manage their forest. I was with the head of a major country, it’s a forest city. He said, “Sir, we have trees that are far more, they ignite much easier than California. There shouldn’t be that problem.” I spoke with the Governor about it. I’m getting along very well with the governor. But I said, “At some point you can’t every year have hundreds of thousands of acres of land just burned to the ground.”"
WALLACE, But sir. . .
TRUMP, That’s burning down because of a lack of management.
WALLACE," But sir, if you believe in the science of climate change, why have you rolled back the Obama Clean Power Plan which limited carbon emissions in power plants? Why have you relaxed…?"
TRUMP, Because it was driving energy prices through the sky.
WALLACE, Why have you relaxed fuel economy standards that are going to create more pollution from cars and trucks?
TRUMP," Well, not really because what’s happening is the car is much less expensive, and it’s a much safer car, and you’re talking about a tiny difference. And then what would happen because of the cost of the car you would have at least double and triple the number of cars purchased. We have the old slugs out there that are 10, 12 years old. If you did that, the car would be safer. It would be much cheaper by $3,500."
WALLACE, But in the case of California they have simply ignored your rollback.
TRUMP," No, but you would take a lot of cars off the market because people would be able to afford a car. Now, so, and by the way, we’re going to see how that turns out. But a lot of people agree with me, many people. The car has gotten so expensive because they have computers all over the place for an extra little bit of gasoline."
WALLACE, OK. . .
TRUMP, And I’m okay with electric cars too. I think I’m all for electric cars. I’ve given big incentives for electric cars but what they’ve done in California is just crazy.
WALLACE," All right, Vice President Biden. I’d like you to respond to the president’s climate change record, but I also want to ask you about a concern. You propose $2 trillion in green jobs. You talk about new limits, not abolishing, but new limits on fracking. Ending the use of fossil fuels to generate electricity by 2035, and zero net emission of greenhouse gases by 2050. The president says a lot of these things would tank the economy and cost millions of jobs."
BIDEN," He’s absolutely wrong, number one. Number two, if in fact, when, during our Administration in the Recovery Act, I was able, was in charge, able to bring down the cost of renewable energy to cheaper than or as cheap as coal and gas and oil. Nobody’s gonna build another, uh, coal fired plant in America. No one’s going to build another oil fire plant in America. They’re going to move to renewable energy, number one,"
WALLACE," What about, what about the argument that President Trump basically says, that you have to balance environmental interests and economic interests? And he’s drawn his line."
BIDEN," Well, he hadn’t drawn a line. He still, for example, makes sure that we, he wants to make sure that methane’s not a problem. We can, you, you can now emit more methane without it being a problem. Methane. This is a guy who says that you don’t have to have mileage standards for automobiles that exist now. This is the guy who says that, well the fact is. . ."
TRUMP, Not true. Not true.
BIDEN, It’s all true. And here’s the deal. . .
TRUMP," He’s talking about the Green New Deal. And it’s not 2 billion or 20 billion, as you said. It’s 100 trillion dollars."
BIDEN, I’m. . . I’m. . . .I’m talking about the Biden plan. . .
TRUMP, Where they want to rip down buildings. . .
WALLACE," [to Biden] Let him go for a minute, and then you can go."
TRUMP, And rebuild the building.
BIDEN, No.
TRUMP, It’s the dumbest-
BIDEN," That is not, that is not. . ."
TRUMP, … most ridiculous. . . Where airplanes are out of business. Where two car systems are out. . .
BIDEN, Not true. . .
TRUMP, . . . where they want to take out the cows too.
BIDEN, Not true.
TRUMP," You know, that’s not true either, right?"
BIDEN, Not true.
TRUMP," This is, this is a 100 trillion. . ."
BIDEN, Simply. . . Look-
TRUMP, That’s more money than our country could make in a hundred years if it were. . .
BIDEN, That is simply not the case. . .
TRUMP, It would destroy our country.
WALLACE," All right. Let me. Wait a minute, sir. I actually have studied your plan, and it includes upgrading 4 million buildings, weatherizing 2 million homes over four years, building one and a half million energy efficient homes. So the question becomes, some, the president is saying, I think, some people who support the president would say, that sounds like it’s going to cost a lot of money and hurt the economy."
BIDEN," What it’s going to do, it’s going to create thousands and millions of jobs. Good paying jobs."
TRUMP, Hundred trillion dollars.
WALLACE," Let him finish, sir."
BIDEN, He doesn’t know how to do that.
TRUMP, 100 trillion dollars.
BIDEN," The fact is, it’s going to create millions of good-paying jobs. And these tax incentives to people, for people to weatherize, which he wants to get, get rid of. It’s going to make the economy much safer. Look how much we’re paying now to deal with the hurricanes, with, deal with. . . By the way, he has an answer for hurricanes. He said, maybe we should drop a nuclear weapon on them, and they may go away."
TRUMP, I never said that at all.
BIDEN," Yeah, you did say that."
TRUMP, They made it up.
BIDEN, And here’s the deal. . .
TRUMP, You make up a lot.
BIDEN," . . . we’re going to be in a position where we can create hard, hard, good jobs by making sure the environment is clean, and we all are in better shape. We spend billions of dollars now, billions of dollars, on floods, hurricanes, rising seas. We’re in real trouble. Look what’s happened just in the Midwest with these storms that come through and wipe out entire sections and counties in Iowa. They didn’t happen before. They’re because of global warming. We make up 15% of the world’s problem. We in fact, but the rest of the world, we’ve got to get them to come along. That’s why we have to get back into, back into the Paris Accord."
WALLACE," All right, gentlemen. . ."
TRUMP," Wait a minute, Chris. So why didn’t he do it for 47 years? You were Vice-President?"
BIDEN, For 47?
TRUMP," So why didn’t you get the world—China sends up real dirt into the air. Russia does. India does. They all do. We’re supposed to be good. And by the way, he made a couple of statements. The Green New Deal is a hundred trillion dollars. . ."
BIDEN, That is not my plan.
TRUMP, . . .not 20 billion. . . .
BIDEN, The Green New Deal is not my plan. . .
TRUMP, . . . You want to rebuild every building.
BIDEN, . . . If you knew anything about. . .
TRUMP," Well, you want to rebuild everything"
BIDEN, If he knew anything about. . .
WALLACE, Gentlemen. . . Gentlemen. . .
TRUMP," He made a statement about the military. He said I said something about the military. He and his friends made it up, and then they went with it. I never said it."
WALLACE, Okay.
BIDEN, That is not true.
TRUMP, What he did is he said. . .
WALLACE," Okay, we’re going to get into a new segment. Mr. Vice President, Mr. Vice President. . ."
TRUMP, . . .is he called the military stupid bastards.
BIDEN, I did not say that.
TRUMP, He said it on tape. . . [crosstalk]
BIDEN, Not true.
TRUMP, . . .He said “stupid bastards.”
WALLACE, Sir. [crosstalk] Stop.
BIDEN, Play it.
TRUMP, I would never say that.
BIDEN, Play it.
WALLACE, Go ahead.
TRUMP, You’re on tape.
WALLACE, Mr. Vice President answered his final question.
BIDEN," The final question is, I can’t remember which of all his rantings was the final question."
WALLACE," [laughing] I’m having a little trouble myself, but…"
BIDEN, Yeah.
WALLACE, And about the economy and about this question of what it’s going to cost.
BIDEN, The economy. . .
WALLACE, The Green New Deal and the idea of what your environmental changes will do.
BIDEN," The Green New Deal will pay for itself as we move forward. We’re not going to build plants that, in fact, are great polluting plants, we’re gonna build. . ."
WALLACE," So, do you support the Green New Deal?"
BIDEN, Pardon me?
WALLACE, Do you support the . . .
BIDEN," No, I don’t support the Green New Deal."
TRUMP," Oh, you don’t? Oh, well, that’s a big statement."
BIDEN, I support . . .
TRUMP, You just lost the radical left. It’s done. Oh you don’t?
BIDEN, I support the Biden plan that I put forward.
WALLACE, Okay.
BIDEN," The Biden plan, which is different than what he calls “The Radical Green New Deal.”"
WALLACE," All right, gentlemen, final segment: Election integrity. As we meet tonight, millions of Americans are receiving mail-in ballots or going to vote early. How confident should we be that this will be a fair election, and what are you prepared to do over the next five plus weeks? Because it will not only be to election day, but also counting some ballots–mail-in ballots–after election day. What are you prepared to do to reassure the American people that the next president will be the legitimate winner of this election. In this final segment, Mr. Vice President, you go first."
BIDEN," Prepare to let people vote. They should go to iwillvote.com. Decide how they’re going to vote, when they’re going to vote, and what means by which they’re going to vote. His own Homeland Security director, and as well as the FBI director, says that there is no evidence at all that mail-in ballots are a source of being manipulated and cheating. They said that. The fact is that there are going to be millions of people because of COVID that are going to be voting by mail-in ballots like he does, by the way. He sits behind the Resolute Desk and sends his ballot to Florida. Number one."
WALLACE," Mr. President, two minutes."
TRUMP," So when I listen to Joe talking about a transition, there has been no transition from when I won. I won that election. And if you look at crooked Hillary Clinton, if you look at all of the different people, there was no transition, because they came after me trying to do a coup. They came after me spying on my campaign. They started from the day I won, and even before I won. From the day I came down the escalator with our first lady, they were a disaster. They were a disgrace to our country, and we’ve caught ’em. We’ve caught ’em all. We’ve got it all on tape. We’ve caught ’em all. And by the way, you gave the idea for the Logan Act against General Flynn. You better take a look at that, because we caught you in a sense, and President Obama was sitting in the office."
WALLACE, Okay
TRUMP, We have major states with that. . .
WALLACE, Sir. Time. . .
TRUMP, … all run by Democrats-
WALLACE," Sir, two minutes is two minutes."
TRUMP, All run by Democrats.
WALLACE," President Trump. . . I, I,. . ."
TRUMP, It’s a rigged election.
WALLACE," You’re going to be able to continue. You have been charging for months that mail-in balloting is going to be a disaster. You say it’s rigged, that it’s going to lead to fraud. But in 2018, in the last midterm election, 31 million people voted mail-in voting. That was a quarter, more than a quarter of all the voters that year, cast their ballots by mail. Now that millions of mail-in ballots have gone out, what are you going to do about it? And are you counting on the Supreme Court, including a Justice Barrett, to settle any dispute?"
TRUMP," Yeah. I think I’m counting on them to look at the ballots, definitely. I don’t think—I hope we don’t need them, in terms of the election itself. But for the ballots, I think so, because what’s happening is incredible. I just heard, I read today where at least 1% of the ballots for 2016 were invalidated. They take ’em. We don’t like ’em. We don’t like ’em. They throw ’em out. . ."
WALLACE, But what are you going to do about it-
TRUMP, … left and right.
WALLACE, There are millions of ballots going out right now. What are you going to do. . .
TRUMP," What you do is you go and vote. You do a solicited ballot, and that’s okay. . ."
WALLACE, No. No. I know your complaint. I’m asking you about the fact that millions of people have received. . .
TRUMP, You go and vote. You go and vote. . .
WALLACE, No. But what I’m saying is . . .
TRUMP, . . . like they used to in the old. . .
WALLACE, . . . what are you going to do about the fact that millions of people. . .
TRUMP," You either do, Chris, a solicited ballot, where you’re sending it in, they’re sending it back and you’re sending. They have mailmen with lots of it. Did you see what’s going on? Take a look at West Virginia, mailman selling the ballots. They’re being sold. They’re being dumped in rivers. This is a horrible thing for our country."
BIDEN, There is no–there is no evidence of that. . .
TRUMP, This is not going to end well.
BIDEN, There is no evidence of that. . .
TRUMP, This is not going to end well.
WALLACE," Okay. Vice President Biden, in fact, go ahead, sir-"
BIDEN," Five states have had mail-in ballots for the last decade or more. Five, including two Republican states. And you don’t have to solicit the ballot. It’s sent to you. It’s sent to your home. What we’re saying is, they’re saying is that it has to be a postmark by the time, by election day. If it doesn’t get in until the seventh, eighth, ninth, it still should be counted. He’s just afraid of counting the votes because. . . ."
TRUMP, You’re wrong. You’re wrong. I love counting the votes. . .
BIDEN, . . . he knows what the outcome will be.
WALLACE," I want to continue with you on this, Vice President Biden. . ."
TRUMP," Chris, he’s so wrong when he makes a statement like that-"
WALLACE," No. Excuse me. Vice President Biden, the biggest problem, in fact, over the years with mail-in voting has not been fraud, historically. It has been that sizable numbers, sometimes hundreds of thousands of ballots are thrown out because they have not been properly filled out, or there is some other irregularity,. . ."
TRUMP, That could be fraud.
WALLACE," . . .or they missed the deadline. So the question I have is, are you concerned that the Supreme Court with a Justice Barrett will settle any dispute?"
BIDEN," I am concerned that any court would settle this, because here’s the deal. When you file—when you get a ballot and you fill it out, you’re supposed to have an affidavit. If you didn’t know, you have someone say that, this is me. You should be able to, if in fact you can verify that’s you when, before the ballot is thrown out, that’s sufficient to be able to count the ballot because someone made a mistake and not dotting the correct i. Who they voted for, testify, say who they voted for, say it’s you. That is totally legitimate."
WALLACE, All right.
TRUMP," Excuse me, Chris, when you have eighty million ballots. . ."
WALLACE, No. No. No. I have a final [crosstalk].
TRUMP,. . . sent in and swamping the system. . .
WALLACE," Gentlemen, I have a final question . . ."
TRUMP," You know it can’t be done. You know it can’t, and already, there’s been fraud deception and . . . "
BIDEN, Mail service delivers 185 million pieces of mail a day. . .
TRUMP, . . . Eighty million ballots.
WALLACE," We can keep talking. In eight states, election workers are prohibited, currently by law, eight states, from even beginning to process ballots, even take them out of the envelopes and flatten them until election day. That means that it’s likely, because there’s going to be a huge increase in mail-in balloting, that we are not going to know on election night who the winner is, that it could be days. It could be weeks. . ."
TRUMP, Could be months.
WALLACE," . . . until we find out who the new president is. So, I–first for you, sir. Finally, for the Vice-President, and I hope neither of you will interrupt the other. Will you urge your supporters to stay calm during this extended period, not to engage in any civil unrest? And will you pledge tonight that you will not declare victory until the election has been independently certified? President Trump, you go first."
TRUMP," I’m urging my supporters to go into the polls and watch very carefully, because that’s what has to happen. I am urging them to do it. As you know, today there was a big problem. In Philadelphia, they went in to watch. They’re called poll watchers, a very safe, very nice thing. They were thrown out. They weren’t allowed to watch. You know why? Because bad things happen in Philadelphia. Bad things. And I am urging, I am urging my people. I hope it’s going to be a fair election. If it’s a fair election. . ."
WALLACE, You’re urging them what?
TRUMP," . . . I am 100% on board. But if I see tens of thousands of ballots being manipulated, I can’t go along with that. And I’ll tell you what. . ."
WALLACE," What does that mean, not go along. . ."
TRUMP, . .. from a common sense. . .
WALLACE, . . .does that mean you’re going to tell your people . . .
TRUMP, I’ll tell you what it means. . .
WALLACE, … to take to the streets?
TRUMP, It means you have a fraudulent election. You’re sending out 80 million ballots. . .
WALLACE, And what would you do about that?
TRUMP," They’re not equipped. These people aren’t equipped to handle it, number one. Number two, they cheat. They cheat. Hey, they found ballots in a wastepaper basket three days ago, and they all had the name military ballots. They were military. They all had the name Trump on them."
WALLACE, Vice President Biden-
TRUMP, You think that’s good?
WALLACE," Vice President Biden, final question for you. Will you urge your supporters to stay calm while the vote is counted? And will you pledge not to declare victory until the election is independently certified?"
BIDEN," Yes. And here’s the deal. We count the ballots, as you pointed out. Some of these ballots in some states can’t even be opened until election day. And if there’s thousands of ballots, it’s going to take time to do it. And by the way, our military–they’ve been voting by ballots for since the end of the Civil War, in effect. And that’s, and that’s what’s going to happen. Why was it not, why is it for them, somehow not fraudulent. It’s the same process. It’s honest. No one has established at all that there is fraud related to mail-in ballots, that the, somehow it’s a fraudulent process."
TRUMP, It’s already been established. Take a look at Carolyn Maloney’s race. . .
WALLACE, I asked you. You had an opportunity to respond [crosstalk].
TRUMP, Look at Carolyn Maloney’s race. They have no idea what happened. . .
WALLACE," Go ahead. Vice President Biden, go ahead."
BIDEN," He has no idea what he’s talking about. Here’s the deal. The fact is, I will accept it, and he will too. You know why? Because once the winner is declared after all the ballots are counted, all the votes are counted, that’ll be the end of it. That’ll be the end of it. And if it’s me, in fact, fine. If it’s not me, I’ll support the outcome. And I’ll be a president, not just for the Democrats. I’ll be a president for Democrats and Republicans. And this guy if in fact. . ."
TRUMP, I want to see an honest ballot count. . .
WALLACE," Gentlemen, just say that’s the end of it [crosstalk]. This is the end of this debate-"
TRUMP, I want to see an honest ballot count.
WALLACE, We’re going to leave it there. . .
TRUMP, And I think he does too. . .
WALLACE," Good evening from the Health Education Campus of Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic. I’m Chris Wallace of Fox News and I welcome you to the first of the 2020 presidential debates between President Donald J. Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. The Commission has designed the format, six roughly 15-minute segments with two-minute answers from each candidate to the first question, then open discussion for the rest of each segment. Both campaigns have agreed to these rules. For the record, I decided the topics and the questions in each topic. I can assure you none of the questions has been shared with the Commission or the two candidates."
